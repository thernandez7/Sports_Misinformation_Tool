With running mate Brooks Barnhizer still working through a foot injury, however, Martinelli is embracing the opportunity to showcase his impact early. When Eastern Illinois visits Northwestern on Friday in Evanston, Ill., Martinelli will enter with a 28.3 ppg average in three games on 73.8 percent shooting. He's the first Wildcat to score 25 points or more in three straight games since December 2010. ""I'd be hard-pressed to see across the country someone who's playing any better,"" Wildcats coach Chris Collins said. ""He's just a matchup nightmare, and I'm just glad he's on my team because he keeps getting better and better."" Martinelli steered the Wildcats to an 83-74 win against Illinois-Chicago on Tuesday to open a four-game homestand, scoring 27 points on 10-for-14 shooting. Jalen Leach added 16 points for Northwestern (2-1) and Ty Berry chipped in 13. The Wildcats hope to get Barnhizer back soon. The preseason all-Big Ten pick completed warmups on Saturday at Dayton and again Tuesday night but did not play. Barnhizer averaged a team-best 7.5 rebounds last season while his 14.6 points ranked second. Eastern Illinois (1-2) has sandwiched losses at Illinois and then-No. 17 Indiana around a comfortable home victory against Division III Earlham College. The Panthers led the host Hoosiers 37-36 at halftime on Sunday but managed just 18 points after the break in a 90-55 defeat. ""It's just another stepping stone,"" Nakyel Shelton, who led Eastern Illinois with 17 points, told the student newspaper. ""Watch film, grow from it, see what we need to improve on and just making adjustments for the next good school and good program."" Northwestern, another Big Ten foe coming off consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances, fits the bill. To Kooper Jacobi, who had eight points and six boards at Indiana, the Panthers must improve on sustaining their pace and push. ""I think we were showing our ability to make shots and to be able to play with a team that's ranked,"" Jacobi said, ""and I think putting that together in the second half is our next step."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

And the Nets were not happy about it. Brooklyn will strive to bounce back from a frustrating defeat Friday night when it visits New York in NBA Cup action. The two rivals were off Thursday after losing at home Wednesday night. The Nets raced out to a 13-point first-quarter lead before falling to the Boston Celtics 139-114. The Knicks erased a 22-point deficit before Coby White sank three free throws with three seconds left to give the Chicago Bulls a 124-123 victory. The game Friday will be the NBA Cup opener for the Nets and the second East Group A game for the Knicks, who beat the host Philadelphia 76ers 111-99 on Tuesday. The Nets, whose streak of five consecutive playoff appearances ended last spring, appeared ready to embark on another rebuilding project when they made the rare intracity trade by dealing Mikal Bridges to the Knicks on July 6 for a package that included six draft picks and one pick swap. Brooklyn has multiple first-round picks in 2025, 2027, 2028 and 2029. Yet the Nets entered Thursday are a respectable 5-7 through 12 games, within just 1 1/2 games of the third-place Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference. But Wednesday's loss was the most lopsided and discouraging of the season for the Nets, who led for more than 18 minutes in the first half before being outscored 74-54 in the last two quarters. The defending NBA champion Celtics led by as many as 30 in the fourth quarter. ""I'm OK with losing but I'm not OK with at one point of the game, not fighting,"" Nets head coach Jordi Fernandez said. ""We played a pretty good half against a very good team and we come out of the half and we kept fighting. It was not going our way. But you can never, ever quit or look defeated, whatever the case may be."" Ziaire Williams led the Nets with 23 points against Boston, his first time leading the team in scoring in a game this season. The Knicks were a popular pick to contend for the NBA title after adding Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns to a team that reached the Eastern Conference semifinals last season. Yet they are 5-6 through 11 games and have yet to win or lose more than two straight games. New York seemed destined for a substantial defeat when the Bulls led for more than 34 consecutive minutes between the first and fourth quarters and opened up a pair of 22-point leads in the third quarter. But the Knicks scored 17 straight points to end the third and mounted an 8-2 run to take a 123-121 lead on Jalen Brunson's layup with four seconds left. The potentially seismic win turned into a disappointing loss when Josh Hart fouled White and Brunson missed a potential game-winning jumper at the buzzer. ""It was a tough one -- it should have been a big statement win for us,"" Hart said. ""It (would have been) the first win where we really got hit and really turned to swing back. I've got to be better, That one is on my shoulders."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Blue Jackets are tied for the fewest points (12) in the NHL, though the Penguins are not on a much better pace. Columbus has played only 15 games, while the Penguins have 15 points through 18 games. Mired in a six-game (0-5-1) winless drought, the Jackets' most recent defeat was a 5-2 loss to the Seattle Kraken on Tuesday. Columbus took a 2-0 lead into the first intermission, but the strong start was erased by four Kraken goals in the second period. ""It seems like for the last string of games, we're just taking one period off,"" Jackets forward Zach Aston-Reese said. ""It's just these one-period lapses where we give up like five or six odd-man rushes, couple of grade-A (scoring chances), and we just shoot ourselves in the foot."" The 0-4-1 road trip dropped the Jackets to 1-5-2 in away games this season. Friday's return to Columbus could be beneficial, as the Blue Jackets have a 4-3-0 home record this season. Neither locale has been much help to the Blue Jackets in their very lopsided rivalry with the Penguins. Dating back to the 2015-16 season, Pittsburgh is 23-4-4 against the Jackets, including an ongoing 13-game (11-0-2) points streak. Head-to-head history notwithstanding, this season's Penguins have looked anything but dominant. Pittsburgh had an 0-5-1 streak of its own in October, and the club is 1-2-2 in its last five games. Every point is crucial as the Penguins try to climb out of this early-season hole, so forward Bryan Rust saw Wednesday's 3-2 overtime loss to the Detroit Red Wings as ""a good step"" for his struggling team. Detroit held a 2-0 lead in the second period before the Penguins equalized and eventually forced overtime. ""The way we responded (when) we went down two was a hell of a lot better than the way we responded the other night,"" Rust said, referencing Monday's 7-1 loss to the Dallas Stars. ""Rome wasn't built in a day. We're trying get this thing going in the right direction as fast we can."" Pittsburgh forward Blake Lizotte is questionable for Friday's lineup following an early exit against the Red Wings. Lizotte didn't return to the ice after he was bloodied from a puck to the face during the first period. Evgeni Malkin leads the Penguins with 18 points (five goals, 13 assists), while Sidney Crosby is right behind with 17 points (six goals, 11 assists). Crosby is two goals away from becoming the 21st NHL player with at least 600 career goals. Kirill Marchenko leads the Blue Jackets with 15 points (six goals, nine assists). Since the Jackets also play Saturday in Montreal against the Canadiens, goaltenders Elvis Merzlikins and Daniil Tarasov figure to split the consecutive starts in some order. The Penguins also play on Saturday at home against the San Jose Sharks, which likely means rotating starts between Alex Nedeljkovic and Tristan Jarry over the back-to-back games.

Washington's only two wins are against Atlanta, as the Wizards beat their Southeast Division rivals 121-119 on the road Oct. 28 and 133-120 at home on Oct. 30. Now matching up as East: Group C opponents for the second NBA in-season event, Washington will look to end its six-game losing streak. Last time out, the Wizards fell to the San Antonio Spurs 139-130 as Jordan Poole's 42 points were topped by Victor Wembanyama's career-high 50 points. Washington trailed 122-101 with seven minutes left, but Poole's layup trimmed its deficit to six with 1:40 remaining before ultimately falling. ""One thing that we've talked about with our group is resiliency,"" Wizards head coach Brian Keefe said. ""We did not start the game well, but we answered the bell and came back. (San Antonio) made a run in the fourth, and we cut it close at the end. Good progress with our team, but no more moral victories for us."" Poole's 42 points were his most since being traded to Washington in the 2023 offseason. Through ten games this season, Poole has averaged 22.2 points per contest to lead the team, up from his 17.4 per game last season. ""This is how we want Jordan to play, aggressive,"" Keefe said. ""He puts pressure on the defense. That opens up the game for everybody else."" Alongside Poole, Kyle Kuzma is averaging 15.8 points per game, followed by Bilal Coulibaly's 15.3. Playing mostly off the bench, Washington's Jonas Valancuinas has averaged 12.7 points with a team-best 7.8 rebounds. The Hawks are fresh off their best win of the season, stunning the defending champion Boston Celtics 117-116 on Tuesday in each team's first NBA Cup group-play game. Atlanta, which entered after losing three of four games, beat host Boston without Trae Young (Achilles tendinitis). Young leads the team with 23.9 points and 11.5 assists. Jalen Johnson helped to fill Young's absence with an 18-point, 12-rebound, 10-assist triple-double,  Dyson Daniels added 28 points, seven assists and six steals. Daniels, who was traded to Atlanta as part of the deal that sent Dejounte Murray to the New Orleans Pelicans, has brought a much-needed defensive mindset to the Hawks. Atlanta allowed 120.5 points per game last season, tied for second most in the NBA only to Washington. The Hawks added Daniels in hopes of creating havoc for opposing offenses and he has delivered 23 steals in his last four outings, increasing his league-leading total to 3.6 steals per game. The Wizards' Poole is second at 2.3 steals. ""His ability to impact the game is unique,"" Hawks head coach Quin Snyder said of Daniels. ""He's got a good sense of how to be solid and not gamble, but to also use his anticipation opportunistically to impact the game with steals. He's appreciated on a lot of levels.""  Offensively, Daniels has seen his scoring jump from 5.8 points to 14.3 points per game this season. Following Johnson's second-career triple-double, the fourth-year player is averaging 19.0 points and a team-best 10.2 rebounds per game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

In their opening Cup game Tuesday, the Pistons won 123-121 in overtime over the visiting Miami Heat. Despite Gradey Dick's career-best 32 points, the Raptors dropped their Cup opener 99-85 on Tuesday to the Milwaukee Bucks to end a five-game road trip. The Pistons faced the Bucks the next day and suffered a 127-120 overtime road loss after leading by 18 points. Ron Holland II missed two free throws in the final second of regulation that could have won the game. Cade Cunningham had 35 points, 11 assists, seven rebounds, three blocked shots and two steals for Detroit, which allowed a 59-point performance by Giannis Antetokounmpo. Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff looks at the NBA Cup as preparation for playoff-style games for his young team. ""Understanding possessions matter more, turnovers matter more, rebounds, execution, all those things matter more in meaningful basketball games,"" Bickerstaff said this week. The Pistons have won five games this season and appear poised to easily surpass last season's franchise-worst 14 victories, which has the players enthused. ""It's been fun, that's all I can really say,"" said Jalen Duren, who had nine points, nine rebounds and six assists on Wednesday. ""It's been super fun since the start, since preseason. Getting to know these guys, growing with these guys, even the guys that have been here, growing with them and continuing to get better and learn each other, it's been great. We've been through a lot."" The Pistons were without Tim Hardaway Jr. (head laceration), Jaden Ivey (right great toe sprain) and Simone Fontecchio (left great toe sprain) in Milwaukee. All three are day-to-day. The Raptors also are dealing with injuries, most notably Scottie Barnes (right orbital fracture) and Immanuel Quickley (left elbow UCL partial tear). Quickley missed eight games this season with a pelvic contusion suffered in the season opener. Bruce Brown (knee) and Kelly Olynyk (back) have also been out. Toronto has struggled defensively. ""We were scrambling to guard very basic actions,"" Jakob Poeltl said after Toronto's 123-103 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday. ""For sure they have good offensive players that make plays and punish mistakes, but we have to hold ourselves to a higher standard. ... We shouldn't be making mistakes like these."" In the loss to the Bucks, the Raptors committed 22 turnovers leading to 28 points. ""I really thought we were fighting and competing for 48 minutes,"" Raptors coach Darko Rajakovic said after Tuesday's loss. ""I thought turnovers were a big problem for us."" Rajakovic did take some positives from the team's attitude during the winless trip. ""They understand the situation that they're in that they're undermanned with the injuries we're dealing with,"" he said. ""The guys are showing a lot of togetherness and a lot of fight and I'm really proud of that. We've got to continue pounding, we've got to take one game at a time and focus on us and our development."" The Pistons won two of three over the Raptors last season, losing the lone game at Toronto. The last time the teams met, Duren had 24 points and a career-best 23 rebounds on March 13 when the host Pistons won 113-104. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Butker won't be on the field when the Chiefs (9-0) visit the Buffalo Bills (8-2) on Sunday trying to win an 16th consecutive game dating to last season.  Eighth among NFL kickers in points with 75 this season, Butker connected on 18 of 20 field-goal attempts and 21 of 22 extra points. Both of the missed field goals were on tries beyond 50 yards. Butker's career 89.21 field-goal percentage ranks third in NFL history. The Chiefs have won seven of nine games by a one-possession margin in 2024. Their last visit to Buffalo was a 27-24 nail-biter win in last seasons's AFC Divisional Playoffs, and the regular-season meeting with the Bills was a 20-17 loss. The Chiefs also dropped a 24-20 decision to the Bills in the 2022 regular season. A 25-year-old rookie from Notre Dame, Shrader connected on both of his field-goal attempts for the Jets last week at Arizona. He joined the Jets after being released by the Indianapolis Colts, who used Shrader in Week 1 for three successful PATs as the injury replacement for placekicker Matt Gay. He entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent and played college football only after first pursuing a pro soccer career. He enrolled at USF in 2019 and was the primary kicker for four seasons. As a graduate transfer in 2023, Shrader had four 50-yard field goals for the Fighting Irish.  Butker, 29, signed a self-negotiated four-year, $25.6 million extension in August that made him the highest-paid kicker in the NFL.  Butker set the Super Bowl record for longest field goal during the Chiefs' 25-22 overtime win over the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII earlier this year. Butker's 57-yard field goal with 5:01 left in the third quarter supplanted the previous record that had been set just one quarter earlier by 49ers rookie Jake Moody, who kicked a 55-yarder to give San Francisco an early 3-0 lead. Originally drafted out of Georgia Tech by the Carolina Panthers in the seventh round of the 2017 NFL Draft, Butker has played all seven of his NFL seasons with the Chiefs. Shrader participated in the Colts' 2024 offseason program and training camp after originally signing with the team as an undrafted free agent. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The men's basketball team could be following a similar script.   The Mustangs were picked 13th of 18 in the ACC preseason poll but have put together a promising first week of the season. Their first road test comes Friday against Butler in Indianapolis. SMU is 3-0 under new head coach Andy Enfield, taking care of business against Tarleton State, Florida A&M and UNC Greensboro by beating those teams by an average of 25.3 points.   The Mustangs have Boopie Miller to thank at the offensive end of the floor. Miller has scored 20 points in every game, becoming the first SMU player with a three-game 20-point streak since the 2021-22 season. With averages of 20.7 points and 7.7 assists per game, Miller leads all ACC players in both categories.   Miller transferred from Wake Forest, meaning he has experience in the ACC that most other SMU players do not. Matt Cross, formerly of Miami and Louisville, returned from an injury in the season opener to score eight points against UNC Greensboro.   The Mustangs also debuted Turkish big Samet Yigitoglu, who had 13 points in his first game since the NCAA affirmed his eligibility.   ""When we get our full team, I think we have great potential,"" Miller told the SMU athletics website. ""For me being ACC last year, with everybody on the floor, with everybody back, I think we're going to be a great team.""   SMU also racked up 32 steals in the first three games. B.J. Edwards has 12 to lead the conference, and Miller and Kario Oquendo have eight apiece.   Butler (2-1) was nearly on upset alert for the second straight game before putting away Western Michigan 85-65 on Monday.   The Bulldogs had a two-point lead at halftime but scored 16 of the first 18 points of the second half. After the Broncos rallied within three, Butler shut the door thanks in part to Augusto Cassia, who scored eight of his career-high 16 points in the final 6:50 of his first career start.   Pierre Brooks II led with 20 points for Butler, which previously lost 68-66 against Austin Peay.   ""It means a lot to me,"" said Cassia, a native of Brazil. ""I've worked hard the past couple years. I had a couple minor setbacks. It meant the world to me to be the starting five and help my team win (Monday), honestly.""   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Lots of zeros. A vote by the PGA of America will ultimately determine whether, and how much, U.S. players are paid for playing in the Ryder Cup.  U.S. players competing at the event could receive roughly $400,000 apiece according to a report. The pay structure, according to The Telegraph, would be similar to that of the Presidents Cup in September -- a stipend as opposed to a contribution made to the charity of each golfer's choice. However, there are two primary differences between the Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup, according to The Telegraph. First, the amount. The Presidents Cup stipend was $250,000. Second, who is getting paid. While players and captains for both teams were paid at the Presidents Cup in Montreal, the European Ryder Cup golfers will not get paid -- instead opting to play for what European captain Luke Donald called ""passion"" for golf and country. ""It's one week where you play for more than yourself,"" Donald told The Telegraph. ""It's ... not about money or points, it's about coming together as a team and the fans feed off that -- it's all passion. I don't think we should ever get paid."" Rory McIlroy was asked this week about the idea of compensation for participation in the Ryder Cup, and scoffed at the notion of requiring cash to entice players to represent their side of the international competition. McIlroy and the European team will not be directly tied to the PGA of America payment vote. The DP World Tour represents the European players on Ryder Cup matters. ""I personally would pay for the privilege to play on the Ryder Cup,"" McIlroy said in a BBC Sport interview. ""The two purest forms of competition in our game right now are the Ryder Cup and the Olympics, and it's partly because of that -- the purity of no money being involved."" McIlroy said he understands the ""other side of it"" because of the amount of money made on the event. He said Donald huddled players to discuss their stance after learning the direction American golfers were leaning. But McIlroy said the consensus for Team Europe was to donate the sum to the DP World Tour for other purposes.  ""That $5 million would be better off spent elsewhere on the DP World Tour to support other events or even to support The Challenge Tour,"" McIlroy said.  ""I think we would all welcome money if it didn't change the dynamic, but the money really would change the dynamic. That's why I think everyone is like -- let's not do that."" Shane Lowry said he worked toward getting a chance to play in the Ryder Cup and involvement was more than enough compensation.  ""I love the tournament, and I just want to be involved. I don't care whether I get paid or not,"" he told the Irish Independent.  Talks of Americans getting paid for the Ryder Cup have been brewing for decades. In 1999 at Brookline, Mass. (one of the most famous Ryder Cup weekends in the event's history), golfers including Tiger Woods voiced their opinions on players not being paid despite the event raking in several million dollars. ""I would like to see us receive whatever the amount is, whether it's $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 and I think we should be able to keep the money and do whatever we see fit,"" Woods told The Washington Post in 1999. ""I personally would donate all of it to charity. With all the money that's being made, we should have a say in where it goes."" The charitable donations began being made that same year. Pay-for-play at the Ryder Cup became a hot-button topic during last year's competition near Rome after American Patrick Cantlay did not wear a hat during Saturday's play. Multiple reports stated he did not wear the hat as a protest for players not being paid. Cantlay denied that being the reason, instead saying the hat just did not fit. Said one anonymous European player to The Telegraph: ""(The Americans) can do whatever they want. But we don't want payments in our bank accounts, as it'll be the thin end of the wedge and is not what the Ryder Cup is about. ""Let's face it, a lot of the American players have been angling towards this for years, if not decades. ""If it does go ahead, then it will be interesting to see how the fans react at Bethpage, although they'll probably announce it as just an extension of what already happens."" The 2025 Ryder Cup is scheduled to take place Sept. 23-28. The Americans hold a 27-14 advantage all time in the event, though the Europeans have won five of the last seven contests, including a 16 1/2-11 1/2 win at Marco Simone Golf and Country Club in Italy in 2023.

First it will have to get through the visiting Chicago Bulls on Friday night.   The Cavaliers remained perfect with a 114-106 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday night. They continue to work toward a 24-0 mark, the record the Golden State Warriors achieved to start the 2015-16 campaign before taking a loss in Game 25 of the season.   Darius Garland collected 25 points and Donovan Mitchell added 23 to go along with 13 rebounds and nine assists to carry Cleveland past the Knicks. The Cavs trailed by as many as eight in the third quarter.   Mitchell realizes the historical start places a massive target on the back of the Cavaliers, meaning every opponent will bring their A-game against them as long as the winning streak is alive.   ""We're hunting, but it's also November,"" Mitchell said. ""I keep telling everybody, let's relax. I'm saying it is November. We're not winning a championship right now. But these are good tests.   ""The fact that we're 13-0 is great. We could be 9-2. It doesn't really matter to me. I think the biggest thing is how do we just continue to build the habits through getting every team's best shot on a night-by-night basis.""   Chicago certainly challenged Cleveland on Monday night when the game was knotted at 106 with 5:06 left in regulation. The Bulls faded down the stretch in what ended up being a 119-113 loss.   Zach LaVine paced the Bulls with a team-high 26 points on 12-of-20 shooting, then went off for 31 points in a narrow 124-123 win over the Knicks on Wednesday. LaVine also supplied seven boards and eight assists against New York.   ""Pretty sharp,"" LaVine said of his offensive game as of late. ""Let's keep it that way.""   There's an off chance that guard Lonzo Ball is ready to rejoin the Bulls. The oft-injured point guard missed the past eight games due to a right wrist sprain.  Bulls coach Billy Donovan isn't getting his hopes up.   ""I know he was optimistic and hopeful to get back this upcoming weekend,"" Donovan said. ""I don't know if that's realistic. That's what he was shooting for. We're not ruling that out, but a lot of that is going to depend on how he progresses. ... When he starts shooting threes, how does that respond?""   Ball was used off the bench in three games this season before being sidelined with the injury. Coby White and Josh Giddey have been starting in the backcourt. They have their hands full with Garland and Mitchell on Friday.   ""We're just sticking together,"" Garland said. ""Just taking it game by game. We know we've got a target on our back, so we've got to come in with that aggressiveness and that confidence that we're going to win every game, and that's what we've been doing.

Undefeated prior to a bye in late October, Iowa State (7-2, 4-2 Big 12) since lost 23-22 to visiting Texas Tech and 45-36 to Kansas on a neutral field. The College Football Playoff rankings released Tuesday night as the guide for the 12-team playoff left the Cyclones out entirely, opting for a second American Athletic Conference team -- No. 25 Tulane (8-2) -- over the likes of Iowa State and ACC rep Pittsburgh. Pitt also started undefeated only to drop back-to-back games and fall out of the rankings.  The CFP committee sent a clear indication to Iowa State that a third straight setback would all but end any chance of being part of the playoff field.  No. 6 BYU (9-0, 6-0) leads the Big 12 and No 17 Colorado (7-2, 5-1) stands second.  Iowa State is part of a four-way tie for third but still has a shot at making a statement with No. 16 Kansas State on the schedule to end the regular season. Cyclones coach Matt Campbell isn't ready to accept that the Big 12 title quest is over. ""I guess we're gonna find out,"" Campbell said. ""... The reality is what show's up next Saturday? ... We've got great leadership. We've got great coaching, but the reality of it is, who are you when things aren't going great? And we're gonna find out."" Quarterback Rocco Becht passed for a season-high 383 yards in the loss to Kansas while Jaylin Noel had a career-best 167 receiving yards. He matched his career high of eight receptions while increasing his consecutive games with a catch streak to 41. Becht is still stunned that an undefeated start disintegrated so fast. ""All the work that you put in to get to 7-0, and then those two losses coming out like that, it's tough to move on,"" Becht said. Another challenge for the Cyclones is that Tyson Veidt is Cincinnati's defensive coordinator. He served as Cyclones assistant head coach the past eight seasons before moving on to the Bearcats. ""Obviously, we are playing Iowa State, a defense that we hired coach Tyson from, so it gives us more familiarity with their defense,"" Bearcats coach Scott Satterfield said. ""I think having gone against it in the spring and in the summer, so we'll have a better idea about it."" Cincinnati (5-4, 3-3) has dropped two straight games, including a frustrating 31-24 to visiting West Virginia last weekend. The Bearcats held a 436-248 edge in total offense and owned a 24-10 edge in first downs. But three turnovers by Cincinnati quarterback Brendan Sorsby (one interception, two fumbles) led to 17 West Virginia points. ""We've got to take care of the football, bottom line,"" Satterfield said.

Orlando dropped five straight, including the first four of the eight games All-Star forward Paolo Banchero has missed due to a torn right oblique. The Magic have regrouped amid a four-game homestand, which concludes with Friday's NBA Cup contest. In all four wins of the streak, Orlando held its opponents to 94 points or fewer, including the 89 the Magic gave up in a 25-point victory over Charlotte to open NBA Cup play on Tuesday. Orlando limited the Hornets to 34-of-84 shooting from the floor and forced them into 22 turnovers. The Magic followed that up on Wednesday by holding Indiana to 32-of-84 shooting from the floor with 16 turnovers in a 94-90 Orlando win. ""So proud of this group,"" coach Jamahl Mosley said of the Magic's defensive tenacity. ""We talk about how much grit this team is. You see how connected they are. ... That's part of this league, and part of growth of a group that's finding ways to win."" Along with Orlano's defensive effort, Franz Wagner's offensive production has been a consistent theme on this run. He enters Friday's contest averaging 27.8 points during the win streak after Wednesday's 29-point effort. Goga Bitadze has also come up big for Orlando. His 12-point, 12-rebound performance on Wednesday marked his third double-double since Nov. 6. ""He gave us that spark. Got a little chippy, but we're OK with that, and he's OK with that,"" Mosley said of Bitadze. ""He plays with that little bit of edge."" Bitadze's assignment on Friday includes slowing down former Most Valuable Player Joel Embiid, who returned to the 76ers' lineup for the first time this season on Tuesday. Philadelphia was without Embiid, Tyrese Maxey and Paul George for the second leg of a back-to-back on Wednesday, however. The Sixers dropped their seventh game in the last eight outings with a 114-106 home loss to undefeated Cleveland. Wednesday's setback followed a 111-99 defeat in Philadelphia's NBA Cup group-play opener vs. New York on Tuesday. Embiid scored 13 points on just 2-of-11 shooting in his season debut. With Embiid and George resting and Maxey nursing a strained a hamstring strain until at least the end of the week, rookie Jared McCain went for career highs of 34 points and 10 assists against Cleveland. ""It's a tribute to my work. I work so hard, I feel like I need these games,"" McCain said. ""I'm starting to learn more being a lead guard. In college, I feel like I was more off-ball. So it's definitely a learning process there. ""I'm finding my shot, whether it's the mid-range, getting to the rim or obviously shooting the (3-pointer)."" Sixers coach Nick Nurse suggested McCain's play could earn the first-year guard a prominent role even after Embiid, George and Maxey are available. ""He's certainly played his way into the whole mix for sure,"" Nurse said. ""Responded well to his start, but he's got to be a candidate playing this well to get into the lineup."" Fellow Sixers rookie Adem Bona also earned Nurse's praise for his nine-rebound effort off the bench vs. Cleveland. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Bruins (2-1) fell out of the AP Top 25 poll after a 72-64 loss to New Mexico in Henderson, Nev., on Nov. 8, but rebounded emphatically with a 71-40 rout of Boston University on Monday.  UCLA's first game in its lengthy homestand began without Dylan Andrews, who was scratched from the lineup shortly before tipoff due to a groin injury. He is day-to-day and could play in Friday's contest.  With Andrews out, Eric Dailey Jr. and Lazar Stefanovic led the way in scoring with 13 points each, while Sebastian Mack added 12 points off the bench. Tyler Bilodeau, who scored 18 and 23 points against Rider and New Mexico, respectively, had a more subdued performance with six points on Monday.  Although UCLA cruised in its return home, turnovers remained an issue.  The Bruins committed 15 turnovers on Monday, down from the 21 they gave up vs. New Mexico but still well above the season-long average of less than 11 each of the previous four UCLA teams surrendered per game.   ""We're trying to move the ball more. When you emphasize passing, they're going to have more turnovers,"" Bruins coach Mick Cronin said. ""There's risk-reward when you're a high ball-movement team."" Lehigh (0-3) comes into Los Angeles for the final leg of a four-game road swing to open its season. The Mountain Hawks opened with a 90-46 loss to UCLA's new Big Ten Conference counterpart Northwestern but were much more competitive in 85-77 and 76-75 losses at Georgetown and Columbia, respectively.  In Tuesday's loss at Columbia, Keith Higgins Jr. (28 points) hit a 3-pointer with five seconds remaining to tie the game at 75, but Cam Gillus was called for a foul on the ensuing Lions possession. Columbia's Avery Brown made a game-winning free throw with less than a second remaining.  ""We can't control the whistle at all times, but what we can do is control our effort on the glass,"" Lehigh coach Dr. Brett Reed said via the school's official athletic site. ""During that stretch of time when Columbia extended their lead, it came from extra possessions, extra opportunities and finishes at the rim.""

The Heat are 0-1 in NBA Cup East: Group B play, while the Pacers will be playing their first game of the in-season competition that culminates next month. Losers in four of their past five games, the Heat could be without Jimmy Butler, who came away with an ankle injury in Friday's loss to the Denver Nuggets and has not played in the past two games. Butler did not participate in practice Thursday.  Miami's Tyler Herro is doing all he can, notching his second career 40-point game against the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday, when the Heat's undoing was a puzzling coaching mishap from Erik Spoelstra in the final seconds. Spoelstra requested a timeout when his team was out of them after the Pistons tied the game with 1.1 seconds remaining in overtime.  Instead of having the ball in a situation that would have extended the game to a second overtime at worst, Spoelstra's technical foul sent the Pistons to the free-throw line for a go-ahead free throw in an eventual 123-121 loss.  The loss put the Heat two games under .500 and left Spoelstra despondent after the game.  ""I feel horrible about it,"" Spoelstra said. ""There's really no excuse for that. I'm 17 years in, we had talked about it in the huddle, I knew that we didn't have anything. I just got emotional and reactive on that, and I just made a horrendous mistake there at the end."" The Pacers were unable to build off a 132-121 home win over the New York Knicks on Sunday and lost 94-90 to the Orlando Magic on Wednesday. They scored only 83 points in a road loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Friday. Indiana's Bennedict Mathurin led the Pacers with a career-high 38 points in the win over the Knicks, helping push his season average to 19.7 points per game. Pascal Siakam leads the team at 20.5 points.  The Pacers couldn't overcome a rough shooting night from Tyrese Haliburton against the Magic on Wednesday. Haliburton scored nine points on 3-of-14 shooting (21.4 percent), including 2 of 8 from 3-point range. Haliburton scored six points on 2-of-11 shooting against the Hornets on Friday, but sandwiched between those performances was a 35-point, 14-assist outing against the New York Knicks. Haliburton is averaging 16 points per game, just behind Myles Turner's 16.8 points per game. Haliburton also has a team-high 8.5 assists, but both his scoring and assist averages are down from a year ago in the early going. The Pacers have been challenged by the schedule to start the season, with much of the action against playoff teams from a season ago. ""We've got to fight and claw for everything at this point in the season,"" Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle said. ""These first 10 or 12 games are as tough as anybody's schedule in the league and so we've got to make it about the collective group, and who we are and what we're trying to stand for.""  For the Heat, Herro is averaging a career high 24.9 points to lead the team and trails only Bam Adebayo in minutes per game with 33.5. Herro also has averages of 5.2 rebounds and 5.3 assists. Butler is second on the team with 16.1 points per game, while playing in eight of the team's 10 contests, while Adebayo is averaging 15.3 points and 9.1 rebounds. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The public declaration of moving on from the running-back-by-committee setup confirmed what already was evident, with Dowdle making seven starts this season to two for Elliott. The former undrafted free agent out of South Carolina also leads the team in carries (83) and yards rushing (374). ""Definitely, you have to get him the ball,"" McCarthy told reporters about Dowdle. ""That's my focus to continue to get him opportunities. He's the lead back."" Without a rushing touchdown this season, Dowdle does have three receiving TDs on 24 catches for 166 yards. It has been a rough season for the Cowboys, who are just 3-6 and on a four-game losing streak after Sunday's 34-6 domination by the Philadelphia Eagles. Dowdle's 53 yards rushing against the Eagles were more than the 45 yards passing from quarterback Cooper Rush on 23 attempts. Dowdle, 26, is in his fourth NFL season, not counting 2021, which he missed with a hip injury. He was the third-string back in 2022 and was backup to Tony Pollard last season. Elliott, drafted by the Cowboys with the No. 4 overall pick in 2016, spent seven seasons with Dallas before signing a one-year free agent deal with the New England Patriots in 2023. In his return to the Cowboys in 2024, the 29-year-old Elliott has just 171 yards on 54 carries with two touchdowns. Dowdle has played in 44 career games since 2020 but did not make a start until this season. He has gained 759 yards rushing with two touchdowns on 179 carries and also has 41 career receptions for 310 yards and five TDs.

The main storyline will be whether the team can continue its scalding 3-point shooting. After sinking 18 3-pointers in a win over Southern, Iowa followed up with 13 against South Dakota, giving the team 41 in three games. It's not a case of saturation shooting, either.

Riley has changed the team's style of play significantly, going to a more up-tempo approach. So far, Washington State is averaging 93.7 points per game and has seven players averaging in double figures. ""I think we're gonna have a balanced attack,"" Riley said.

""I'm looking forward to Friday. It will be a great day, great evening, be a packed gym,"" Stoudamire said. ""We'll have Dennis's ceremony, so I'm looking forward to it. I'm excited and I'm looking to see ... we lose to North Florida, we win (Tuesday), can we respond on Friday? It's an SEC team, it is a rivalry game and I'm interested, like I said, to see how we respond to that."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Eagles (7-2) have a five-game winning streak and overtook the Commanders (7-3) for first place in the NFC East on Sunday, when Philadelphia demolished Dallas and Washington lost a nail-biter to Pittsburgh. Forget the short week of practice, Dan Quinn was ready to lead his Commanders into Philadelphia by Monday. ""I'm fired up about it. ... This is what division games should be -- an absolute blast,"" the first-year Washington coach said. ""Philadelphia and Washington battling for it? Hell yeah!"" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni was a little less psyched about the prime-time matchup, calling the quick-turnaround Thursday night games ""a pain in the butt to prepare for"" during his Monday press conference. ""It's just that everything gets crammed into a shorter amount of time,"" Sirianni said. ""So that's what we're working through right now, is I think a lot of guys will have big bags under their eyes at the end of the week, but we've got to do what we need to do as coaches to get the guys ready."" ODDS AND TRENDS The Eagles had settled in as consensus 4.0-point favorites by mid-day Thursday. They have been the slightly more popular choice at BetRivers, where the Eagles have been backed by 56 percent of the spread-line tickets and 57 percent of the money. Meanwhile, the book reported that the Commanders have failed to cover the spread in six of their last seven games against teams with a winning record. Philadelphia's -195 moneyline to win the game outright has also drawn 66 and 91 percent of the action, respectively. Eight of Washington's past nine road games have gone over the total points line, and BetRivers has seen 74 percent of the money on the 49.0-point line supporting the Over ahead of this matchup. PROP PICKS --Terry McLaurin Over 4.5 Receptions (-135 at DraftKings): This has been the most popular player prop at the book. The Commanders' wide receiver has averaged 6.6 targets and 4.7 receptions per game this season. That includes at least five catches in four of his past five games, with the lone exception being a touchdown on both of his two receptions against the New York Giants in Week 9. McLaurin has at least 98 receiving yards in three of his past four games. --DeVonta Smith Over 52.5 Receiving Yards (-131 at BetRivers): This has drawn 2.1 percent of all money wagered on player props at the book, leading all options. Smith had only two catches for 14 yards last week, but he wasn't needed much in the blowout win at Dallas. In his other seven games this season, Smith has topped 52.5 receiving yards six times. And with A.J. Brown healthy, the Commanders won't be able to consistently slide coverage toward Smith, who has at least 64 receiving yards in six of his past seven home games. KEY STATS Commanders rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels has not thrown an interception in five consecutive games, while Eagles counterpart Jalen Hurts has thrown at least two touchdown passes in each of the past four meetings. He also has scored at least two rushing touchdowns in three of his past four games overall. THE NEWS Philadelphia's defense enters Week 11 ranked No. 2 in the NFL in yards allowed (274.1 per game) and tied for fifth in points allowed (17.9 per game). ""We've improved as a defense, but I know we feel we have a lot more to grow,"" Eagles linebacker Nakobe Dean said. ""I don't think you ever say that you have ‘arrived' as a defense. It doesn't work that way in this league."" The Philly defense will be tested by a rookie quarterback who has ""arrived."" Daniels has completed 68.7 percent of his passes for 2,147 yards with nine touchdowns and just two interceptions through 10 starts, adding 464 yards and four scores on the ground. The Washington offense is tied for third in the NFL in scoring (29.0 points per game) and ranks fourth with 377.0 yards per game. The Commanders let a 10-point, second-half lead slip away against the Steelers, losing on Russell Wilson's 32-yard TD pass to new teammate Mike Williams with 2:22 to play. The loss stung, but right guard Sam Cosmi wanted to make sure it didn't linger and addressed the Commanders in the locker room after the game. ""I wanted them to know that what we have here is still special,"" Cosmi told reporters. ""Like no matter what, we still keep fighting."" INJURY REPORT The Eagles welcomed starting left tackle Jordan Mailata (hamstring) back to practice this week and activated him from injured reserve on Wednesday, clearing the way for his return Thursday night. Cornerback Darius Slay (ankle), tight end Dallas Goedert (ankle) and Dean (groin) were full participants in Wednesday's practice after being limited on Tuesday. Receiver DeVonta Smith is dealing with a hamstring injury and has been limited in practice all week. Recently acquired cornerback Marshon Lattimore (hamstring) did not practice with the Commanders all week and was ruled out for the game, along with kicker Austin Seibert (right hip) and linebacker Nick Bellore (knee). Running back Brian Robinson Jr. (hamstring) has missed the last two games but was taken off the injury report and will be active for the game. The Commanders listed as questionable left tackle Brandon Coleman (shoulder), offensive tackle Cornelius Lucas (ankle) and right tackle Andrew Wylie (shoulder) after they were limited in practice.  SERIES HISTORY The Commanders and Eagles will meet again in Week 16 in Landover, Md. Philadelphia has won five of the last six meetings, including season sweeps during the 2021 and 2023 campaigns. PREDICTION The Commanders are coming off a hard-fought loss against Pittsburgh, but have still won seven of their past nine games. At least they don't have to go a long distance on a short week. The Eagles are rolling and their veteran leadership is a definite advantage in a contest that could go a long way toward deciding the division champion and home-field advantage come playoff time. --Eagles 27, Commanders 24 --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

He’s closer to social security than his physical prime.  Paul, famed for his YouTube rise and a reputation in the ring built on hand-picked opponents, has heavy fists for a marketing-minded businessman but fights Friday with heavier pockets and zero conscience. Never in professional boxing would Tyson be expected to tap out. Even at 58, throwing in the towel is a foreign concept to the grandfatherly “Iron Mike,” who enters the very loosely sanctioned bout in Texas with the ring presence of a very loosely leashed incapacitated predator. The made-for-Netflix match is going to make money. Fittingly, a personal injury law firm dropped $2 million for the best seats in the house, taking a big bite of the hook from a promotion company Paul controls, to be close enough to know whether legends falling in the ring will make a sound. It all has the appeal equal to that of a car wreck with onlookers bracing to see the worst while tapping the brakes just enough to display a modicum of public humanity. Tyson is party to the circus only to the extent the temperamental lion does what it needs to do for the rich reward of its next meal under the big top.  Nearly two decades removed from his last meaningful fight—June 11, 2005—against Ireland’s Kevin McBride—Tyson isn’t getting in the ring to add pelts to his wall. His fighting legacy is secured. But the $80 million purse, a $20 million guarantee—that’s the carrot Tyson chased to Texas. Paul, 27, was eight when Tyson was stopped by McBride in the sixth round as the surprising final chapter in a celebrated heavyweight career.Hope as we might, this isn’t a fight-your-dad fable where Pops wallops the kid to zip his lips once and for all. Yes, Paul walks into the ring Friday with the lion’s leash wrapped around his wrist, knowing Tyson stands as much as a puncher’s chance. But that longshot outcome is likely only if Tyson can excavate the long-lost hand speed and power combination that first brought him to glory as a heavyweight boxing champion at age 20 in 1986. Jake Paul was born in 1997. Glory, greed and self-aggrandizing are the title belts draped around Paul when he steps through the ropes this weekend. Sadly, ineptly, Tyson stared blankly Wednesday in Texas while Paul masqueraded through legends of the ring and taunted the now-Silent Mike to keep striking matches until the fire appears. ""I fear no man. I want him to be that old, savage Mike. He says he's going to kill me. ‘Is that what you're going to do?’” Paul said, begging for Tyson to react. “I want there to be no excuses when I knock him out. Is that what you're going to do?"" The lion sleeps. That flame is gone. No one would expect the 50-win Tyson to find his way to the ring, by any realistic measure of energy, effectiveness or clout.  If Tyson leaves with anything but his seventh career loss, it would be an upset. A one-time 42-1 favorite over Buster Douglas in 1990, who delivered the greatest upset of Tyson’s career, the longshot bet on Friday night will be lucky to remain upright past his bedtime. With Tyson speaking only with his eyes other than a declaration that he’s “just ready to fight,” Paul kept the jabs going and perhaps unintentionally framed the charade in the only context that matters. “It is ... I don't know,” Paul smirked surveying what was one The Baddest Man on the Planet.  “It is pretty boring. Pretty fucking boring.”  Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Eagles (1-1) have not won any of the four all-time meetings between the programs -- this is the first since 2003 -- and look to bounce back from losing 80-55 to VCU last Friday in the Veterans' Classic in Annapolis, Md. Despite a team-high 17 points from Donald Hand Jr. and Roger McFarlane recording a double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds, fourth-year coach Earl Grant's team shot just 29.3 percent and allowed 24 points off 17 turnovers. ""(VCU) obviously capitalized on our mistakes, and a lot of our mistakes were uncharacteristic,"" Grant said. ""I'm glad it (was) the second game of the year. I think we're a lot better than what we showed."" As of Thursday, Hand was the third-leading scorer in the Atlantic Coast Conference, averaging 19.5 points per game alongside 9.0 rebounds. ""He's kind of paid his dues,"" Grant said. ""He's been loyal and been around the program, kind of like an elder statesman at this point. And even though he's ... only (in his second year) on the court and really hadn't had the opportunity (for) playing time. Now he's in a new role, and he stepped up by playing good basketball."" Temple (3-0) is now chasing its first 4-0 start since 2019 following a 69-61 win over Drexel on Tuesday. In the Owls' first Big 5 game of the season, Philadelphia native Zion Stanford netted a career-high 23 points of 9-ofo-13 shooting with two 3-pointers. Continuing that success on the road is the focus now. ""That's what good teams do, right? You have to win in nonconference play away from home,"" Temple coach Adam Fisher said. ""Good teams take care of your games at home. We had two in November, took care of that. ... This will be our first opportunity in a true road game, against an ACC school. We're trying to build this team so we can play meaningful games in March."" Jamal Mashburn Jr. added 20 points against the Dragons after eclipsing that number in the first two games against Sacred Heart and Monmouth.

With less than 12 weeks until Bow,"The 2024 NASCAR season is in the books and the clock already is ticking on one of the shortest offseasons in sports. With less than 12 weeks until Bowman Gray Stadium hosts the Busch Clash on Feb. 2, here are the storylines you need to know going into the 2025 season. New Faces in New Places NASCAR free agency arguably has never been more chaotic than it is right now. Whether due to retirements, team closings or expiring contracts, a host of drivers will be with new organizations in 2025. The most notable individual of the bunch is Chase Briscoe, who will take over the No. 19 Toyota at Joe Gibbs Racing following the retirement of Martin Truex Jr. and the closure of Stewart-Haas Racing. It's an excellent opportunity in his young career, and 2025 has the potential to be a huge year for a driver still trying to prove that he's a perennial contender. Two other Stewart-Haas alumni have found Cup Series opportunities for 2025 as well. Josh Berry will run his second Cup Series season with the fabled Wood Brothers following the departure of Harrison Burton, while Noah Gragson will take over the vacant seat at Front Row Motorsports left by 2021 Daytona 500 winner Michael McDowell. Spire Motorsports will be the next team to employ McDowell's services behind the wheel, as he'll join the up-and-coming organization in 2025, driving the No. 71 Chevrolet Camaro. The No. 71 was left vacant after it was announced that Zane Smith would leave Spire at the conclusion of 2024. There are quite a few seats still open for the 2025 season as of this writing. Rick Ware Racing has yet to confirm a driver for 2025, leaving the future of Corey LaJoie, who finished out the season driving the team's No. 51 Ford in doubt. 23XI Racing and the aforementioned Front Row Motorsports are both expected to run a third entry next season, though the teams' ongoing antitrust lawsuit against NASCAR could potentially hinder those plans. Kaulig Racing also has yet to announce a driver for their second full-time Cup Series entry, while Team AmeriVet has not announced a driver for what is expected to be a 15-17 race schedule in 2025. Will Kyle Busch bounce back? Busch's 2024 season made headlines, but for all the wrong reasons. His 20th Cup Series campaign was his first without a win and his worst year statistically since his rookie season in 2005. The two-time champ is capable of winning on any given Sunday, but the No. 8 team and Richard Childress Racing have work to do in order to get back to their winning ways. Will Penske retain its momentum? It's safe to say that Roger Penske is at the top of the motorsports mountain for the time being. After winning the Rolex 24 at Daytona, the Indianapolis 500 and his third consecutive NASCAR Cup Series championship with Joey Logano, the 87-year-old racing mogul and his team have shown how to consistently win championships in NASCAR's playoff era. Ryan Blaney, the 2023 champion, has proven himself to be one of the top drivers in the sport, while the indomitable Logano can never be counted out of contention, as his 2024 title run showed. How will Hendrick, Gibbs respond? Hendrick Motorsports and Joe Gibbs Racing dominated the first half of the 2024 season, but both were shockingly torn down by Penske in the playoffs. Their lack of firepower in the postseason was extremely surprising, as only one car of the eight fielded by the two four-car operations -- Hendrick Motorsports' William Byron -- made it to the Championship 4. Hendrick and Gibbs each boast four of the top drivers in the sport, and both Rick Hendrick and Joe Gibbs have to be motivated to reach the top of the mountain again in 2025. Which young driver will take the biggest step forward? The Cup Series is littered with young talent going into 2025. Gragson, Tyler Reddick, Christopher Bell, Chase Elliott and Blaney make up only part of a young core that makes the NASCAR Cup Series so competitive. However, one young talent is lurking in the shadows: Michigan's Carson Hocevar, who ran away with the Rookie of the Year award in 2024. With a growing Spire Motorsports behind him and a year of Cup Series experience under his belt, don't be surprised if he takes massive strides in 2025 en route to his first career win or a potential playoff berth. --Samuel Stubbs, Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Cavaliers (2-0) will aim to remain undefeated under interim coach Ron Sanchez when they battle Villanova on Friday at the Hall of Fame Series in Baltimore. Sanchez is still less than a month into his new role. He was entering his second season as Virginia's associate head coach before being promoted after NCAA championship-winning coach Tony Bennett retired abruptly on Oct. 18. The Cavaliers have so far held their own since the seismic coaching change. Virginia began Sanchez's tenure with a 65-56 win over Campbell before cruising past Coppin State 62-45 on Monday. ""Big picture, I would say we've been resilient,"" San Diego State transfer Elijah Saunders said. ""We've been through a lot in this past month."" Saunders, who ranks second on the team with an average of 13 points per game, is confident the Cavaliers are prepared for their first battle against a major conference foe. ""Different level of physicality, different level of size,"" Saunders said of the Wildcats, a Big East member. ""And we have a young group, so it'll be some guys' first time seeing that level of talent on the floor, but I'm excited. I think we're ready for the challenge."" Like Virginia, Villanova (2-2) knows the sting of suddenly losing an iconic head coach. The Wildcats endured that strife when Jay Wright departed after the 2021-22 season, ending a 21-year tenure that included two national titles. Third-year coach Kyle Neptune has gone 37-35 since taking over for Wright. Villanova suffered a stunning 90-80 home loss to Columbia on Nov. 6 and fell 83-76 to Saint Joseph's in Philadelphia on Tuesday. Fifth-year senior Eric Dixon, who played under Wright during his freshman and sophomore seasons, said this year's Wildcats have shown grit amid their struggles. ""We had plenty of chances to lay down and fold (on Tuesday), but we came back and we fought, fought, and fought,"" Dixon said. ""At the end of all of it, it's all you can ask for, so I really like that about us."" Dixon leads Villanova in scoring (26.3 points per game) and rebounding (8.3 per game). After the Wildcats battle the Cavaliers on Friday, Penn State will face Virginia Tech to close out the Baltimore leg of the Hall of Fame Series. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Given who's next on the Hokies' schedule, that leap came just in time.  Virginia Tech (3-0) will try to slow down Penn State's high-powered offense on Friday when the teams meet at the Hall of Fame Series in Baltimore. The Hokies clamped down against the Eagles following what Young called a ""next to deplorable"" defensive effort in Friday's 93-74 win over South Carolina Upstate. Virginia Tech held Winthrop to 34.5 percent shooting after letting the Spartans shoot 50.9 percent from the floor. ""We weren't very connected (on Friday) and I thought the complete flip of that was (Monday),"" Young said. Young's squad will be tested by the Nittany Lions (3-0), who have scored at least 90 points in each of their first three games for the first time since the 1995-96 season. Penn State put up 108 and 103 points in wins over Binghamton and UMBC, respectively, before hanging 92 on visiting St. Francis in a 30-point win Tuesday. Puff Johnson scored a career-high 20 points to pace the Nittany Lions in Tuesday's victory, but Penn State's offense has been all about balance. The Nittany Lions have had a different top scorer in each game, and Northern Illinois transfer Yanic Konan Niederhauser (15 points per game) leads a cast of five players who average double figures. Penn State coach Mike Rhoades doesn't have a clear go-to scorer, but he seems just fine with how his offense is running. ""When the ball is hot and everybody's getting a piece of it, I think that creates confidence,"" Rhoades said. "" ... When guys share the ball and you go from good shots to great shots, the rim gets bigger."" Like the Nittany Lions, the Hokies have multiple scoring threats. Toibu Lawal (14.3 points per game) leads the pack, while Mylyjael Poteat (12.7), Jaden Schutt (12.0) and Jaydon Young (11.0) round out Virginia Tech's double-digit scorers. Lawal also is the Hokies' top rebounder (8.7 per game). The VCU transfer paired 10 points with 10 boards in Monday's win. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

""We deeply appreciate that the Yankees have graciously allowed us to play at Steinbrenner Field for the 2025 season,"" Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg said. ""The hurricane damage to Tropicana Field has forced us to take some extraordinary steps, just as Hurricanes Helene and Milton have forced thousands of families and businesses in our community to adapt to new circumstances as we all recover and rebuild."" ""The Trop"" is not expected to be playable for MLB games until the 2026 season, according to a report released Tuesday by the city of St. Petersburg, Fla. ""We are happy to extend our hand to the Rays and their fans by providing a major league-quality facility for them to utilize this season,"" said Hal Steinbrenner, chairman and managing general partner of Yankee Global Enterprises, which owns the Yankees. ""Both the Yankees organization and my family have deep roots in the Tampa Bay region, and we understand how meaningful it is for Rays players, employees and fans to have their 2025 home games take place within 30 minutes of Tropicana Field. ""In times like these, rivalry and competition take a back seat to doing what's right for our community, which is continuing to help families and businesses rebound from the devastation caused by hurricanes Helene and Milton."" Per the Tampa Bay Times, the Rays opted for Steinbrenner Field -- which features a capacity of 11,026 -- over BayCare Ballpark in Clearwater, Fla. The latter park is the spring home of the Philadelphia Phillies. ""Given the significant challenges caused by Hurricane Milton, I appreciate the hard work and collaboration between the two teams that allowed the Rays to make the best decision for next season,"" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said. ""This outcome meets Major League Baseball's goals that Rays' fans will see their team play next season in their home market and that their players can remain home without disruption to their families.""

But Friday, the two finally will play again, meeting in Ann Arbor, Mich., with each looking for a key non-conference win. Michigan won that only other matchup, winning 82-60 on Dec. 13, 1962. Friday's game will be the first of a home-and-home series that will see Michigan visit Fort Worth, Texas, in 2025. For TCU, it will be its first game against an opponent from a power conference after recording three straight wins to start the season over Florida A&M (105-59), Florida Gulf Coast (67-51) and Texas State (76-71). ""I know they are big, I know they are skilled,"" TCU coach Jamie Dixon said of Michigan. ""I'm excited about it. Whoever we play, I'm going to be excited. I want to get better, and that's what I told our guys."" The glaring concern for TCU through the first three games has been free-throw shooting. The Horned Frogs have made just 35 of 62 shots (56.5 percent) from the line. On the other side, Michigan comes in at 1-1 following a 72-70 loss to Wake Forest on Sunday on a neutral court in Greensboro, N.C. It's a new era for the Wolverines, who hired Dusty May as head coach from Florida Atlantic and have seen a big roster turnover. Only three players (Will Tschetter, Nimari Burnett, Jace Howard) are back from last year, with six transfers and four freshmen comprising the rest of the roster. Given that, it might take some time this season for the Wolverines to jell. Auburn transfer Tre Donaldson (13.0 points per game) and Ohio State transfer Roddy Gayle (12.0) lead the Wolverines in scoring through the first two games.

He's on the list of reported recruits attending Florida's game Saturday against LSU along with prep teammate and five-star wide receiver recruit Jaime Ffrench. Jones' recruitment is now open to others beyond the Gators. He is scheduled to announce his college choice at Mandarin on Dec. 6. Ffrench decommitted from Texas on Wednesday. He initially committed to Alabama but pulled back when Nick Saban announced his retirement. Ffrench was courted by Ohio State, LSU and Miami before giving the Longhorns a verbal commitment at a ceremony on Aug. 30. Ffrench is the No. 14 overall prospect and third-ranked wide receiver according to On3.

This is just a little stump in the road for him. I think that the comeback is going to be even greater."" The Seminoles are 1-9 this season, 1-7 in the ACC, after going 13-1 in 2023. Florida State already lost a number of recruits ranked in the top tier of the 2025 class, including Myron Charles, Javion Hilson, Malik Clark, Daylan McCutcheon and CJ Wiley. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Payton Thorne, Freeze's starting senior quarterback, missed practice during the bye week and might not be available Saturday for Auburn (3-6, 1-5 SEC). Thorne injured his shoulder two weeks ago in the Tigers' matchup with Vanderbilt, when the Commodores left Alabama with a 17-7 victory. Freeze's outlook against ULM (5-4, 3-3 Sun Belt) for the Auburn home date had an ominous tone. ""We'll see how this week goes with that and with the others getting reps -- and go from there,"" said Freeze. ""When I say that, it's certainly not an indication that I don't think he's played pretty solid here as of late. You start thinking big picture. That's not always the easiest thing to do, because you love your players. You want what's best for all of them that gives us the best chance to win the remaining three games. We'll start seeing how the health is foremost."" If Thorne cannot go, Freeze indicated redshirt freshman Hank Brown, Holden Geriner or Walker White would be the options. A 24-point favorite over ULM, Auburn would like to produce a strong performance in preparation for its final two games of 2024, both against ranked foes -- home against No. 15 Texas A&M and the annual Iron Bowl against No. 10 Alabama, this year in Tuscaloosa. The Warhawks have experienced the ups and downs of Sun Belt play, winning their first three outings before dropping three straight. ""Always in the state of Louisiana, there's a bunch of athletes, and they've got their share for sure,"" Freeze said. One of those athletes Freeze called out by number after film review is running back Ahmad Hardy. ULM's No. 22 averages 101.67 rushing yards per game with eight touchdowns. Coach Bryant Vincent's run-oriented squad is averaging 172.1 yards on the ground and 300.8 yards per game overall. However, the opposition has churned out nearly 200 yards rushing and 370.3 total. Hosting Texas State last weekend, ULM fell behind 28-0 in the first half and couldn't recover in a 38-17 loss. The Warhawks fumbled six times but lost just one. Vincent said the sloppy play has become a recurring theme. ""These are tough times, and tough times are tough times,"" he said. ""And how you handle the tough times, as tough as they get, determines, really, the real team that you are and the character you are. We're not done. We're going to keep fighting and not going to change."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Texas A&M (2-1) dropped from No. 13 to 23 in the Associated Press poll after a season-opening upset loss at UCF. The Aggies regrouped quickly over their past two games. The Aggies dispatched East Texas A&M and Lamar by 26 or more points heading into their first shot at a ranked opponent. The 21st-ranked Buckeyes (2-0) are preparing to face a second ranked foe in three games to open this season and early returns indicate Ohio State can stick around as a challenger because of its perimeter shooting. Texas A&M beat Ohio State last season 73-66 in Columbus, Ohio. Ohio State beat then-No. 19 Texas 80-72 in Las Vegas on Nov. 4, which vaulted the Buckeyes into the Top 25. Ohio State backed that ranking up by handling Youngstown State 81-47 on Monday. The Buckeyes showed off their balance and depth with five players scoring in double figures in that win, highlighted by Aaron Bradshaw and John Mobley Jr., who each had 16 points. Ohio State shot a staggering 45.5 percent from 3-point range and pressured the perimeter well on the opposite end, limiting Youngstown State to only 23.7 percent shooting from beyond the arc. Two areas where the Buckeyes know they must improve if they are to remain unbeaten are rebounding and turnovers. Ohio State outrebounded the Penguins 41-29 overall, but gave up 13 offensive rebounds. The Buckeyes also committed 15 turnovers in each of their first two games. More miscues could feed right into Texas A&M's defense, which has recorded a combined 18 steals over its past two contests. ""Coach was harping on us limiting our turnovers and we just wanted to keep our edge,"" Bradshaw said after the win over Youngstown State. ""It's just playing in big-time games, we knew the schedule when we were recruited and we're super excited to go into that environment and play in games like this."" A major factor in the Aggies' quick turnaround from the negative result to open the season is the emergence of Zhuric Phelps in his first season at A&M. Phelps has led Texas A&M in scoring in each of its past two wins and finished with 16 points in a 97-71 win over Lamar on Monday night. Phelps' ability to attack the rim complements his talents as a distributor as he had seven assists as well on Monday. He and Wade Taylor IV, who finished with 13 points, could prove to be a dynamic tandem. Their efforts sparked improved shooting performances for the Aggies over their past two games. Texas A&M shot 55.2 percent overall against Lamar and 55.7 percent against East Texas A&M. They also shot 46.2 percent from 3-point range against Lamar. ""What I think will eventually transpire is (Phelps) is going to make the game easier for the other four guys on the floor,"" said Texas A&M coach Buzz Williams, who picked up his 350th career win Monday. ""... I think he has a very high ceiling and he's a very good on-the-ball defender and I think that changes our team as well."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Juan Soto, OF, Yankees Soto set himself up for the biggest payday in MLB history after batting .288 with a .419 on-base percentage and .569 slugging for the Yankees in 2024. Not to mention a career-best 41 home runs, 129 walks, a league-leading 128 runs scored and 109 RBIs. And Soto didn't even turn 26 until October, when he helped lead the Yankees to their first World Series since 2009. Even if he doesn't eclipse $700 million, the value of his contract almost certainly will exceed Shohei Ohtani's heavily deferred deal. Predicted contract/destination: 13 years, $702 million with the New York Mets. In the bidding: Yankees, Giants, Dodgers, Phillies, Rays, Blue Jays, Red Sox 2. Roki Sasaki, RHP, Chiba Lotte Marines (Japan) Surprise! Sasaki would have made more money (like Yoshinobu Yamamoto did a year ago) had Chiba Lotte of NPB waited two more years to post him at age 25. Instead, the Marines obliged his wishes, so Sasaki will come to MLB but be subject to the same international free agent limitations that Ohtani was when he signed with the Angels in the 2017-18 offseason. That puts Sasaki in every team's price range, and there will be a big demand for a 23-year-old who throws 96.9 mph and features a top-shelf split-finger fastball.

Hatton will have a say in that, even though he wasn't too impressed with his own round on Thursday with seven birdies and two bogeys. ""To be honest I feel like the score was better than it felt.

With or without Bailey, though, Pikiell knows the Scarlet Knights need to improve defensively.  No. 24 Rutgers will look to conclude a season-opening three-game stretch against local rivals Friday when the Scarlet Knights host Monmouth in Piscataway, N.J. Rutgers (2-0) has been off since Monday, when the Scarlet Knights overcame a five-point halftime deficit to beat visiting Saint Peter's 75-65.  Monmouth (0-3) most recently played Tuesday, losing to host Northern Illinois 79-66. The Scarlet Knights have ranked among the country's top 20 defensive teams in four of the past five years per KenPom.com and limited opponents to 32.7 percent shooting from 3-point range last season. But Saint Peter's mounted its upset bid by shooting 53.3 percent (16 of 30) from the field, including 6 of 12 from beyond the arc, while taking a 42-37 halftime lead.  The 42 points by Saint Peter's were the most in the first half against Rutgers since Feb. 22, when Purdue -- led by national player of the year Zach Edey -- scored 52 points in the first 20 minutes of a 96-68 win.  ""I hugged them all and told them how much I appreciate their lousy defense,"" Pikiell said of his halftime address in the Saint Peter's game. Rutgers limited the Peacocks to 26.7 percent shooting from the field -- 4 of 15 from both inside the arc and beyond the 3-point line -- in the second half. But the Scarlet Knights didn't clamp down until Saint Peter's took a 65-64 lead with 4:07 left. Another touted freshman, Dylan Harper, sank a layup 18 seconds later to begin a game-ending 11-0 run for Rutgers, which forced Saint Peter's to miss its last eight shots from the field.  Harper finished with 24 points and leads the Scarlet Knights with an average of 22 points a game this season. ""We're not going to blow everyone out by 40 -- that's unrealistic,"" said graduate student PJ Hayes, who had five points and seven rebounds in 20 minutes of action. ""For us to be able to power through that, for a team that's young and a little inexperienced, we need that."" Bailey, who joined Harper to give Rutgers its top-rated recruiting class ever, is expected to provide the Scarlet Knights a boost sooner rather than later.  ""He's close,"" Pikiell said. Monmouth (0-3) hopes the same is true for redshirt sophomore forward Jaret Valencia, who averaged 8.9 points and 4.4 rebounds last season but has missed the first three games while recovering from hernia surgery. Without Valencia, a preseason all-second team Coastal Athletic Association pick, the Hawks suffered a season-opening 81-57 loss to Michigan State on Nov. 4 before falling to Temple 103-74 last Friday. Monmouth, which was picked to finish eighth in the 14-team CAA, held a pair of four-point leads Tuesday before Northern Illinois took control with an 18-0 run bridging the halves.  ""Disappointing night for us,"" said coach King Rice, who is in his 14th season with Monmouth. ""We have to get better. We'll get home and get back to work."" Sophomore Abdi Bashir Jr. scored a career-high 25 points Tuesday and leads the Hawks with an average of 18.3 points per game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

And that's just where head coach Todd Golden wants it. The attention around the program over the past week has focused on the news of a Title IX investigation into Golden following allegations of sexual harassment, sexual exploitation and the stalking of multiple women, including students. But, he said, his team has been able to concentrate on the court. ""I think they know who I am, and again, they're mature,"" Golden said. ""They're really good guys and all super-focused."" Golden said the way he approaches his job hasn't changed either. ""Respecting the situation, my family, my team, my coaching staff,"" Golden said. ""We're just continuing to attack it like we normally would every day."" And that has led the Gators to three consecutive wins to kick off the season for the first time since 2020-21. Florida dominated Grambling State 86-62 on Monday, with five players scoring in double figures. Rueben Chinyelu, a Washington State transfer, led with 14 points. Walter Clayton Jr., Will Richard and Sam Alexis each scored 12 while Alex Condon added 10 points and eight rebounds. ""This team is super unselfish and they play for each other,"" Golden told reporters after the win. Florida State is coming off a 72-52 win over Tarleton State despite having no player score in double figures. The leading scorer was Daquan Davis, who scored nine and dished out three assists. ""He has moxie. He is a guy who is extremely confident in himself,"" Seminoles coach Leonard Hamilton told reporters after the game. ""He's in control in what he's doing out there."" Davis ranks third on the team in scoring at 7.3 points per game. Jamir Watkins is the leading scorer for the Seminoles, pouring in 18.3 points per outing. While the Seminoles are unbeaten, they still have work to do, especially as they get set to face their first ranked opponent of the season. ""We had some moments in the game (against Tarleton State) that we obviously showed we are still a team that needs to find ourselves in terms of cohesiveness offensively and defensively,"" Hamilton said. The Gators have won all three of their games by double digits and Clayton has been the team's leading scorer at 16.7 points per outing. Richard (16.0), Condon (15.3) and Alijah Martin (12.3) are averaging in double figures as well for the Gators, who feature a total of seven players averaging at least seven points per game. Florida is shooting 50 percent from the field but just 26 percent from beyond the arc. Florida State has won two of its three games by double digits and is 2-0 at home. The Seminoles are shooting 44 percent from the floor but, like the Gators, they have struggled from beyond the arc, connecting on only 21 percent of their attempts. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Place Stadium in Van,"All eyes are on quarterback Nick Arbuckle when the Toronto Argonauts face the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the 111th Grey Cup at B.C. Place Stadium in Vancouver on Sunday. Arbuckle is unexpectedly under center on the CFL's grandest stage after the league's 2023 Most Outstanding Player Chad Kelly sustained fractures to the fibula and tibia in the Argonauts' 30-28 victory over the Montreal Alouettes in the East Division final. Arbuckle made one start in the regular season, faring well in essentially a meaningless game for Toronto (10-8). The 31-year-old completed 23 of 32 passes for 378 yards with two touchdowns in a 31-30 loss to the Edmonton Elks on Oct. 25.  Arbuckle's situation is a bit too familiar to Argonauts head coach Ryan Dinwiddie, who back in 2007 found himself starting in the Grey Cup for Winnipeg after fellow quarterback Kevin Glenn sustained a broken arm in the East final. Dinwiddie threw three interceptions and the Blue Bombers dropped a 23-19 decision to the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the finale.  ""I trust Nick, I believe in Nick,"" Dinwiddie said. ""We didn't change our game plan when he went in, we were aggressive. Fortunately, Nick's played in big games, unlike myself as that was my first time starting. I just told him I'm going to give him an advantageous opportunity to be successful compared to what our coaches asked us to do in 2007."" Arbuckle can lean on running back Ka'Deem Carey (third in the CFL with 1,060 rushing yards) as Toronto tries to defeat Winnipeg (11-7) for the third time this season. The Argonauts posted a 16-14 win in overtime over the Blue Bombers on July 27 in Toronto and 14-11 on Oct. 11 in Winnipeg. The Blue Bombers also fell to Toronto in the 2022 Grey Cup.  Winnipeg advanced to a fifth consecutive title game, claiming a 38-22 victory over Saskatchewan in the West Division final.  Zach Collaros, the 2021 and 2022 CFL Most Outstanding Player, threw for 301 yards and four touchdowns, with trusted target Kenny Lawler recording 177 receiving yards and three scores. Lawler's return from an eight-game absence after a season-opening injury has fueled Winnipeg, which has won eight in a row.  Collaros wasn't interested in any win streaks or injury news related to Kelly -- or his own team -- for that matter.  ""Those things don't matter,"" he said. ""All that matters to us is our preparation. I know we haven't scored a ton of points against this defense. So we've got our work cut out for us."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Somebody Should Probably Help Giannis Antetokounmpo,https://deadspin.com/somebody-should-probably-help-giannis-antetokounmpo/,2024-11-14T15:04:47.434Z,Giannis Antetokounmpo had to score 59 points for the Milwaukee Bucks to beat the Detroit Pistons in overtime. Somebody needs to help out Giannis.,"It took a heroic effort from Giannis Antetokounmpo to drag the Milwaukee Bucks over the Detroit Pistons in overtime on Wednesday night. Antetokounmpo shouldered much of the load for the Bucks. He scored 59 of the team’s 127 points while adding 14 rebounds and seven assists in the victory. Oh yeah, and he had to play 44 minutes. That’s just not sustainable throughout an 82-game NBA season. Damian Lillard remains in the NBA’s concussion protocol, so he missed this game. Khris Middleton is still rehabbing from his ankle surgeries and is yet to make his season debut. But regardless of that, you’d think the Bucks would be able to glide right past the lowly Pistons.  But that’s no longer the case. Since Doc Rivers took over as the head coach of the Bucks, they’re 22-28. Trouble in paradise does not even begin to describe what is happening to the 2021 NBA Champions. They’re officially reeling.  The Lillard trade was a move that was supposed to signify to the rest of the NBA that Milwaukee was here to stay. Again, that has not been the case. Lillard was supposed to be the Robin to Antetokounmpo’s Batman. While it’s certainly a different role for Lillard, who had usage rates through the roof during his time with the Portland Trailblazers, the fit has not equated to winning basketball games. But this is hardly on Lillard. He’s the least of the problems in Milwaukee right now. Somebody needs to step up and help Antetokounmpo, who has already floated the idea of getting traded if the Bucks don’t win the NBA title this year.  “Yeah, if we don’t win a championship, I might get traded,” Antetokounmpo said before the season. “Yeah, this is the job we live. This is the world we’re living in. It’s everybody.” The thing is, the Bucks would be crazy to trade Antetokounmpo unless he requests it. But would he? There’s no real way to tell. Antetokounmpo says a lot. You can’t really tell when he’s joking or being serious, but in the fickle NBA, players joking about a trade is something that’s rarely taken lightly. While every blog under the sun has already editorialized potential trade suitors for Antetokounmpo, it would be wise for somebody in Milwaukee to stand up and help the man out. He’s 29 years old, and this should be the prime of his career. After nearly dropping 60 points, it’s clear Antetokounmpo has plenty more to give to the game. So before the idea of demanding out really creeps into his head, the Bucks should do everything they can to support him. Antetokounmpo, Lillard and Middleton are the most expensive players on this Bucks roster. It doesn’t help that two of them are injured. But outside of that “big three?” Rivers clearly needs to get more out of Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton, who are the next highest-paid Bucks. If he’s going to continue to give Gary Trent Jr., Andre Jackson Jr., AJ Green and Delon Wright serious minutes, they absolutely need to contribute something on the offensive side of the court. Just two weeks into November, the Eastern Conference is a hot mess. There’s plenty of time for the Bucks to save themselves, as only the Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston Celtics and Orlando Magic are over .500 to start the season.  But the Bucks are currently the 12th seed. That's not good. Bucks GM Jon Horst made the move to fire Adrian Griffin, and now he needs to be working the phones to give Antetokounmpo and Rivers the talent needed to survive the season and make the playoffs. If not, Antetokounmpo’s floated trade scenario could come to fruition this summer. Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Smart's 15th-ranked Golden Eagles have been struggling from downtown to start this season, but they'll have a chance to find their 3-point stroke Friday night when they face Maryland in College Park, Md.  Marquette (3-0) went 10-for-36 from deep in a 70-62 victory over Central Michigan on Monday night and has knocked down only 29.4 percent of its triples through the first three games of the season.  ""Those are shots that our guys make in practice, our guys will make in games,"" Smart said of the 26 missed 3-pointers against the Chippewas. ""I'm sure people will say, ‘Well why do you shoot them if they're not making them?' We believe in those guys.""  What had Smart more concerned is what happened after those misses. Marquette snatched only six offensive rebounds against Central Michigan, something Smart considered an unacceptable figure for a team that so often was off the mark.    ""I think as a team, we have a lot of maturing to do from the standpoint of ... having a willingness to win ugly,"" Smart said. ""But then on the flip side, having an understanding of what goes into stepping on the other team's throat when you have a lead.  ""And we're gonna work on continuing to get better at that, and that's something that every year you gotta build. Competition goes up in our next game.""  That competition has been steamrolling teams, as the Terrapins (3-0) have won each of their first three games by at least 30 points.  Maryland most recently beat Florida A&M 84-53 on Monday behind 21 points and nine rebounds from Julian Reese. Selton Miguel chipped in 14 points, while Ja'Kobi Gillespie finished with 12.  The Terrapins ended with five scorers in double figures, also getting 11 points from Derik Queen and 10 from Rodney Rice, and Reese said his team will be tough to slow down with so many weapons.  ""I feel like it's helping us build trust in each other,"" Reese said. ""I feel like we're a versatile team where anybody can have a good night. Derik had a good first night, Rodney's second night off the bench was electric, and I feel like (Monday) was just my night.  ""Friday is probably gonna be somebody else's night. We just keep doing that, and we're gonna be good and staying on ourselves. We're gonna be great.""  Rice is Maryland's leading scorer at an average of 16.7 points per game, while Gillespie and Queen each average 13.7.  Kam Jones has gotten off to a fast start for the Golden Eagles and is putting up a team-high 22.7 points per game. He was held to 12 on Monday, when Stevie Mitchell led Marquette with 17 points.  Maryland has played the Golden Eagles just once, beating them 84-63 on Dec. 1, 2019.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

No. 13 Purdue (3-0) also has won 20 consecutive home games, the fourth-longest active streak. It will be Alabama's first road game of the season, and coach Nate Oats is interested in grading the test. ""Our upside is high like I think we all knew,"" Oats said. ""We also learned that if we don't play with a competitive edge, we're not all that special. We've got to have a competitive edge."" The Boilermakers look to control the pace of Alabama, which prefers high-octane basketball. Oats said he is OK with mixing tempo and he wasn't happy with his club's offensive movement during Monday's 72-64 home win over McNeese State. ""The good thing is Purdue's gonna slow it down, I guess, knowing what their playing style has been for a long time up there,"" Oats said. ""So we're gonna have to win some games where the other team tries to slow it down. We're just gonna have to be a lot more efficient in the possessions we get."" Grant Nelson paced the Crimson Tide with 22 points and eight rebounds against McNeese. The Boilermakers also played on Monday and delivered a 92-84 home victory over Yale. Braden Smith was an all-around sensation with 22 points, nine rebounds, six assists and five steals. Trey Kaufman-Renn added 17 points and Fletcher Loyer had 14. Loyer made both 3-point attempts and is 9 of 12 from long range this season. Overall, the Boilermakers are shooting 43.7 percent (31 of 71) from 3-point range. Purdue coach Matt Painter says the accurate marksmanship is crucial for his team's balanced approach. ""We have to be able to score the ball from the 3-point line,"" Painter said. ""People will try to take it away. They're trying to keep you from taking those shots too."" Loyer is averaging a team-best 17 points per game and shooting 65.4 percent overall. Kaufman-Renn is shooting 64 percent while averaging 15.3 points. Smith is averaging 15 points, 9.3 assists, 6.3 rebounds and 3.0 steals per game. Fourth-leading scorer Myles Colvin (9.3) said the trio leads the way for the Boilermakers, especially in big games. ""Just using our maturity in staying levelheaded,"" Colvin said of the effect of his teammates. ""The older guys like Braden, Fletcher and Trey have been in situations where they've been down and things weren't going their way and they turned it around."" Star guard Mark Sears is averaging 18 points per game for the Crimson Tide, who are shooting just 30.1 percent (25 of 83) from 3-point range. Latrell Wrightsell Jr. (12.3), Nelson (12.0), Clifford Omoruyi (10.7 points, team-best 8.0 boards per game) and Labaron Philon (10.0) also average in double digits. Purdue defeated Alabama 92-86 last season in Toronto, the hometown of Zach Edey, who repeated as consensus national player of the year last season for the Boilermakers and now plays for the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies. Sears knocked down a career-best eight 3-points and scored 35 points for the Crimson Tide. Edey had 35 points and Smith had 27 for the Boilermakers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

North Carolina (1-1) will play at home a week after a memorable outing at No. 1 Kansas, where the Tar Heels rallied from 20 points behind before dropping a 92-89 decision. ""I think we only had four turnovers in the second half,"" North Carolina coach Hubert Davis said. ""Then we started attacking the basket, and that allowed us to score the basket, get fouled, get to the free-throw line and then be able to knock down some threes. And so I was really proud of them, how they got back into the game."" While the North Carolina offense clicked, expect much of the team's attention to be on improving defensively. ""Things can change quickly if our will and our want to and our desire and the defensive end raises,"" Davis said. The coach had concerns about foul trouble for North Carolina's interior players, something he'll seek to correct with better defensive sequences. ""I look at the size of your heart,"" Davis said of being able to compete at that end of the court. Confidence could be growing for North Carolina forward Jae'Lyn Withers after a solid second half in the Kansas game. He scored all 11 of his points after halftime, with a trio of 3-pointers boosting his production. ""He can really shoot the ball,"" Davis said. ""And having a big guy that has the ability to knock down perimeter jump shots, especially from 3, it puts a lot of pressure on opposing defenses. And it's a part of our offense that we want to continue to develop throughout the season, of having him pop more and be able to knock down that 3 that gives us more space for our guards.""

""This was a hard-fought win against a tough team that went to the NCAA Tournament last year and returned a good group of their core,"" Duquettte said. ""So I thought it was a good win, a little sloppy at times but we didn't back down, we played aggressive and scored 81 points against a good team. I don't think they are going to give up 81 points very often. We can win in a lot of different ways, so if that's how you want to play, we'll shoot free throws and we'll fight and show you how we can win that way. ... A lot of guys stepped up, so I'm happy about that."" The River Hawks (2-0) step up against Gonzaga (2-0), a team that destroyed then-No. 8 Baylor 101-63 in its opener and then got past Arizona State 88-80 on Sunday. The Bulldogs were powered by big performances against the Sun Devils from a pair of transfers: Khalif Battle (Arkansas) and Michael Ajayi (Pepperdine). Battle scored all 19 of his points in the second half, including a thunderous alley-oop dunk and a dagger of a 3-pointer from the left corner in the final 10 minutes. ""He's quick-twitch and athletic, and one of those guys who can really, really, really go downhill,"" Gonzaga coach Mark Few said of the 6-foot-5 Battle.

""He assumes every ball is his,"" Few said. They weren't the only big contributors Sunday. Braden Huff came off the bench to score a team-high 21 points on 9-of-13 shooting from the field and Ryan Nembhard added 13 points and 11 assists -- with zero turnovers. ""At points in that game we struggled to get stops, but at the end when we needed them, we really locked in and got them,"" Huff said. ""Last year's team it was a bunch of new guys, so it took us awhile to kind of get acclimated and get used to each other in our roles, but I think this year we've got a lot of returners and guys like KB (Battle) and Mike (Ajayi), the new guys have fit it in kind of seamlessly.

CBS Sports reported the extension of the deal on Thursday, which the NFL confirmed in a statement.  ""Indianapolis and the NFL Combine have a proud history together, so we're thrilled to continue our longstanding partnership with Visit Indy, the Indianapolis Colts, and the local community for this 2026 event,"" NFL executive vice president Peter O'Reilly said in a statement to CBS Sports. ""Our partners in Indy have successfully hosted the football evaluation process for decades, and recently, we've collectively worked to grow and evolve the in-person fan experience, bringing tens of thousands of fans closer to the league's future stars."" The 2025 NFL Scouting Combine is scheduled for Feb. 27-March 2. The draft is being held in Green Bay from April 24-26.  Top 40-yard dash times, vertical leaps and position drills attract viewers and create headlines from Indianapolis. But team officials consistently cite medical evaluations -- a fraction ahead of the in-person, 15-minute interviews with prospects typically conducted at team hotels -- as the chief priority at the combine. Indianapolis has the ideal downtown setup with multiple hotels in near proximity to the Colts' home stadium and convention center, which connects via skywalk to a number of locations in the immediate area. Prospects generally fly into Indianapolis one day before the combine following a schedule set up by position group before running the gauntlet of the off-site medical evaluation, cognitive testing, drug testing, height-weight-arm-hand measurements, on-field testing, strength and agility tests, 15- to 20-minute media sessions and position drills. Among the top prospects in the upcoming draft are Colorado cornerback-wide receiver Travis Hunter, a number of quarterbacks -- Hunter's teammate Shadeur Sanders, Miami quarterback Cam Ward, Georgia's Carson Beck and Quinn Ewers of Texas -- and top-end secondary talent. Georgia safety Malaki Starks is the headliner. But the most coveted talent might be the crop of defensive line or edge prospects. Michigan defensive tackle Mason Graham and Georgia's Jalon Walker and Mykel Williams are among blue-chip prospects. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

As it stands, Tulane (second) and Navy (third) behind No. 24 Army (9-0, 7-0). Navy will face Army in their annual matchup to close the regular season on Dec. 14, but it is designated as a non-conference game and hits after the CFP bracket is announced six days earlier. The Midshipmen call Horvath's number repeatedly, and he has delivered 870 yards rushing and 13 touchdowns with 1,154 yards passing and 11 scores. Count Tulane coach Jon Sumrall among Horvath's fans. ""He's unbelievable. The kid is very athletic, can beat you with his legs, throws it really good. Great anticipation and awareness. I think he's extremely tough,"" Sumrall said. As if Navy's average of 259.1 yards rushing per game (fifth in FBS) isn't impressive enough, a dangerous passing game only heightens the threat, Sumrall said. Eight of Horvath's passing touchdowns have covered at least 31 yards, including two that went for 70-plus. ""How comfortable they are throwing the ball down the field and doing it with consistency is unique,"" Sumrall said. ""A lot of times, three-back-option type teams want to go 3-4 yards a play, grind it out. (Navy doesn't) have a problem doing that, but they have probably more explosive ability throwing the ball down the field than most teams do."" Horvath has been playing through a thumb injury he sustained against Charlotte on Oct. 19 and was held to 50 percent passing with no touchdowns in consecutive losses to Notre Dame (51-14 score) and Rice (24-10). He did have 129 yards rushing and a score against the Fighting Irish. Navy ended the skid with a 28-7 win over South Florida in Tampa last week. Regarding the effect of Horvath's injury on his team's offense, Navy coach Brian Newberry said the plan ""really hasn't changed throughout the course of the year. He's got to be running the football for us. There's times where we may do a little more of that than others, but he's run it very effectively, and so for us to be hitting on all cylinders, he's got to carry the football for us."" On defense, Navy gets to deal with Hughes, who is fourth in the FBS with 1,209 yards rushing. Newberry called Hughes ""as good of a back as there is,"" saying he combines bruising power and elusiveness. ""He's both. He's really athletic, he's big, he's physical, he breaks tackles, he makes the cuts. He's just a total package at running back. Catches it out of the backfield as well,"" Newberry said. The mere threat Hughes poses also sets up Tulane quarterback Darian Mensah, who has thrown for 2,059 yards and 16 touchdowns this season. ""Their team is going to establish that first and foremost, but (then) the play action off of the running game,"" Newberry said. ""The quarterback is a very good player, throws it well, sees the field very well, smart ... is athletic enough to beat you with his feet, so there's lots of challenges with these guys."" Navy cornerback Dashaun Peele has proved to be a weapon as well. The senior has four of the team's 13 interceptions, and he returned two for touchdowns -- covering 61 and 84 yards - in a 51-17 blowout of Charlotte. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Philadelphia Eagles Primed To Reclaim NFC East Perch,https://deadspin.com/philadelphia-eagles-primed-to-reclaim-nfc-east-perch/,2024-11-14T14:26:19.787Z,The Philadelphia Eagles are in a great position to take over the top spot in the NFC East as long as they can get by Jayden Daniels and the Washington,"There’s only one team on the Philadelphia Eagles’ level in the NFC East, and it sure as heck isn’t New York or Dallas. Excitable first-year Commanders coach Dan Quinn is making a big deal out of Thursday’s game, saying, “Philadelphia and Washington battling for it? Hell yeah!” And I was half-expecting to hear Nick Sirianni say something back. To be sure, it’s been a wild few years for the Eagles under Nick Sirianni, from coming three points away from a Super Bowl victory over Kansas City to blowing a 10-1 start and falling flat on their faces last winter. Even early in their current winning streak, Eagles fans were unhappy with Sirianni, and the coach jawed back at a few of them after a narrow win over the Cleveland Browns. So it’s almost reassuring to hear a level-headed Jalen Hurts speak on behalf of the team and say the Eagles are focused on nothing more than their preparation and execution. “I’m not satisfied by any means. There’s nothing to be satisfied about in my eyes, because we’re still growing, we’re still a work in progress,” Hurts said. “There’s no moment we’re gonna ‘arrive’ this year. Some may think we have. Some may think we have it figured out, but we don’t. There’s so much more out there for us to accomplish.” With all due respect to Hurts, the Eagles’ big “arrival” moment is right in front of them. If Philly beats the resurgent Washington Commanders on “Thursday Night Football""—and I  believe it will—there's no debating that the NFC East once again runs through the Linc. You can express all the skepticism you want about this franchise after the Eagles lost six of their last seven games (regular season plus playoffs) last year to fail in spectacular fashion. None of the wins on their five-game streak came against playoff contenders. The only impressive showing was a 20-point win over Joe Burrow and the Bengals; stomping the Cowboys last Sunday in the miserable state they’re in doesn’t prove much. But this team isn’t the 2023 team. One thing flying under the radar about these Eagles is their defense. They haven’t allowed more than 280 yards in a game since before their bye week. They rank seventh in defensive DVOA and tied for fifth in scoring defense. It’s as if Nakobe Dean and all those Georgia Bulldogs stars they’ve drafted know how to make big plays. Pair that with a new star running back who’s doing death-defying stunts and a quarterback who’s running more to keep passing lanes open, and what isn’t there to like? Hurts didn’t have his cleanest game against Dallas, but his one interception and one lost fumble were his first turnovers since September, and I can live with occasional mistakes if it means the offense is playing with some verve and not with fear. Look at the sharp difference in his metrics before and after the bye week. Commanders rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels is the hot new thing who just moved in next door, and some fanalysts want to say he’s already better than Hurts.  I think Daniels is incredible, but it’s funny to me that the Eagles’ strength of schedule matters to critics but the Commanders’ strength of schedule doesn’t. Washington has played just three teams currently above .500, going 1-2 against stiffer competition. Are we positive Daniels is going to set off more fireworks against Vic Fangio’s defense? Both these teams, in their own ways, are better than last year. But one has been here before, and the other is merely a nice story. My prediction is simple: Fly, Eagles, Fly.

I chalked it up to football mania when the DJ spun interludes of “Go Pack Go” at the groom’s behest. It felt beyond obsession, though, once the music pivoted to “The Bears Still Suck Polka,” especially with the bride hailing from suburban Chicago. Nowadays, The Happy Schnapps Combo’s biggest hit resonates as both prophetic and precise. A Week 10 home loss to the once-punchless New England Patriots stretched the Bears’ skid to three games after a promising 4-2 start behind seeming franchise savior Caleb Williams. It’s too soon to say Williams is ruined as a franchise QB—although some sky-is-falling sports talkers have—but one can’t deny this: An inept attack and crummy chemistry have the 2024 Bears cooked. You need not be the next Nostradamus to sense that this much-hyped season will get worse. Sunday’s visit from the Packers starts a stretch in which the Bears will face their NFC North foes in six of the next eight weeks, including three straight. Division-leading Detroit (8-1), Minnesota (7-2), and Green Bay (6-3) all figure to bolster those playoff chances with two cracks apiece at Chicago. The Packers carry a 10-game winning streak against the Bears in the NFL’s oldest rivalry, outscoring them by 127 points over that span while racking up a plus-19 turnover differential. “They’ve been doing really well,” Bears tight end Cole Kmet said. “I haven’t won that [rivalry] game yet, but that’s a game that can course-correct a lot of things, I think, especially if you look good.” Kudos to Kmet for his optimism, but the Bears probably won’t pass the eye test at Soldier Field on Sunday, at least when they have the ball. Chicago enters the game on a streak of 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown, has managed just 27 points in a three-game losing streak, and has allowed 16 sacks of Williams in the past two weeks. The offense averages 277.6 yards per game, third lowest in the league, and is breaking in new offensive coordinator Thomas Brown after coach Matt Eberflus fired predecessor Shane Waldron this week. With Bears fans chanting for Eberflus’ dismissal during the Patriots game—""I""know it’s part of the job,” the 14-29 coach said—the organization made a needed change. Something had to give. It seems Waldron’s giving personality might have paved the way to his ineffectiveness over a nine-game tenure, however. “I would say just probably he was too nice of a guy,” said wide receiver Keenan Allen, one of the organization’s high-profile offseason acquisitions intended to accelerate Williams’ development. “I think during OTAs, training camp, he kind of fell into a trap of letting things go, not holding people accountable. Obviously, those things led to a slippery slope.” Questions about Eberflus’ hold on the locker room mounted even when the current skid merely was one game old. Cornerback Tyrique Stevenson’s trash-talking of Washington Commanders fans moments before his missed assignment helped the defense allow a game-winning Hail Mary as time expired in Week 8 clearly violated much of Eberflus’ famed “HITS” principle. That’s Hustle, Intensity, Takeaways, and (playing) Smart. Eberflus only demoted Stevenson temporarily at Arizona the following week. He didn’t start the game but played most of it after teammate Terrell Smith suffered an ankle injury. Chicago fans know an anagram for “HITS” all too well lately. Indeed, the Bears still—take it away, Happy Schnappsters. Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Denver (5-5) hasn't had a playoff appearance since losing Super Bowl 50 in the 2015 season, while Atlanta (6-4) looks to qualify for postseason play for the first time since its 2017 campaign. A win for either squad could go a long way toward ending its span of futility. The Falcons enter play atop the NFC South, holding a two-game lead on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and a three-game advantage on both the New Orleans Saints and Carolina Panthers. It's the only division in the NFC in which just one team has a winning record. Atlanta had a chance to stretch its lead last Sunday but dropped a 20-17 decision to a New Orleans Saints' team that had lost seven straight games. The usually reliable Younghoe Koo missed three field goals in the loss for Atlanta, which squandered an opportunity to take a stranglehold on the division. The Falcons' offense failed to reach the 20-point mark for the fourth time this year and Atlanta fell to 0-4 in such games.  Kirk Cousins' 306 passing yards raised his season total 2,634, third in the NFL. The 36-year-old veteran knows that the disappointing loss will have to be put behind the team before Sunday's matchup against one of the NFL's best defenses. Denver's defensive unit is allowing just 17.7 points per game, which ranks fourth in the league. ""You've got to get the bad taste out of your mouth after Sunday's game. It sits with you,"" Cousins said. ""But we understand the work it takes to get ready for Denver, the defense that they are, the challenges they present, and just the importance of the game. ... Statistically what they've done this year speaks for itself. It's a good challenge for us."" Ready to challenge the Denver defense are running back Bijan Robinson (748 rushing yards) and receivers Darnell Mooney (684 yards) and Drake London (649). Cousins was limited in Thursday's practice due to right shoulder and elbow injuries. As impressive as Denver's defense has been, the Broncos' offense has hit a wall the past two weeks. After mustering just 10 points at Baltimore, the Broncos managed just 260 total yards in last week's 16-14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. Still, the Broncos had a chance to give Kansas City its first loss before Will Lutz's 35-yard field goal attempt was blocked as time expired. The Broncos hold the final wild-card spot in the AFC, one game ahead of the Indianapolis Colts and Cincinnati Bengals. For head coach Sean Payton, his team knows that everything still is in front of them. ""This team has been resilient. The sky isn't falling,"" Payton said. ""We're sitting here 5-5 and we would've loved to be 6-4 with a win (Sunday), but the focus shifts quickly to the next game. I like the leadership on this team. It's entirely different than it was a year ago. It's tough mentally and physically, and we've got a good week of practice coming up before Atlanta."" Rookie quarterback Bo Nix threw for 215 yards and two touchdowns last time out, upping his season total to 1,968 passing yards -- second-most by a first-year player (Washington's Jayden Daniels, 2,147).  ""We're close. We've just got to find ways to make plays and to get over the hump,"" Nix said. ""In this league, that's the line between playoff teams, championship teams. All of the guys are going to continue to fight."" Atlanta cornerbacks Dee Alford (hamstring) and Antonio Hamilton (pectoral), defensive linemen James-Smith Williams (tibia) and Ta'Quon Graham (pectoral), and tight end Charlie Woerner (concussion) did not participate in Wednesday's practice. For Denver, wide receiver Josh Reynolds was designated to return from the injured reserve after sustaining a finger injury in Week 5. Reynolds had 12 catches for 183 yards and a touchdown prior to the injury. Defensive end Zach Allen (elbow, rest) and safety Brandon Jones (abdomen) were both limited in Wednesday's practice.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Flexed into the late Sunday window, the Chargers (6-3) are on a three-game winning streak behind Justin Herbert and are pointed toward the playoffs just past the midway point of the schedule.  The Bengals (4-6) still have work to do to move into playoff eligibility behind Joe Burrow, but they are just one game out of the final AFC postseason spot despite a sub-.500 record.  Perhaps more than a clash of quarterbacks selected in the first round of the 2020 draft, Sunday's meeting is about the Bengals' elite offense against the Chargers' much-improved defense that still is trying to prove it is as good as the numbers suggest.  The Bengals average 27 points per game, fifth in the NFL. The Chargers have allowed an NFL-best 13.1 points per game, but a relatively easy schedule has created skeptics. Their current winning streak has come against the New Orleans Saints, Cleveland Browns and Tennessee Titans, whom they got past 27-17 last Sunday.  The Chargers finally have been able to develop an identity, something new head coach Jim Harbaugh said he was searching for into the first month of the season.  ""I know what our guys are now,"" Harbaugh said this week. ""... They're going to play as hard as they can, as fast as they can, as long as they can. Big challenge (on Sunday). I know our guys are not afraid of any challenge, any new challenge, and they're going to attack it.""  Herbert had just 164 yards passing and a touchdown in Sunday's victory, while the Chargers' defense recorded seven sacks, even as star outside linebacker Khalil Mack (groin) was limited to four plays. Bud Dupree and Tuli Tuipulotu each had two sacks.  The Chargers' 31 total sacks are tied for fourth in the NFL heading into Week 11.  Mack did not practice Wednesday, while outside linebacker Joey Bosa (hip), running back Gus Edwards (ankle), cornerback Kristian Fulton (hamstring) and linebacker Daiyan Henley (illness) were limited.  The Bengals enter with the fourth-best passing offense in the NFL at an average of 254.8 yards per game. Burrow's 2,672 passing yards lead the NFL, while his 24 TD passes are tied for the top spot.  Still, his four TD passes in Week 10 were not enough as the Baltimore Ravens pulled out a 35-34 victory in another prime-time game on Nov. 7.  The mini-bye game gave Cincinnati ample time to prepare for another member of the Harbaugh family. After the loss to brother John Harbaugh's Ravens, it's now time for Jim Harbaugh's Chargers.  ""They're going to run the ball well, get into manageable third downs, they're not going turn it over, keep everything in front on defense and try to shorten the game,"" Burrow said of the Chargers while referencing a similarity to the Ravens. ""We have to find ways to take our opportunities down the field.""  Ja'Marr Chase had 11 receptions for 264 yards against the Ravens, including three touchdowns. His final TD catch came with 38 seconds remaining to bring Cincinnati within one, but a two-point conversion failed.  ""We're just trying to find wins at this point,"" Burrow said. ""You'd like one to turn into two to turn into three. But the only way you can do that is to focus on the day to day.""  Burrow was a full participant in practice Wednesday but was listed with right wrist and left biceps injuries. Wide receiver Tee Higgins (quad) was limited. Linebacker Joe Bachie (hip), offensive tackle Orlando Brown Jr. (knee/fibula), defensive tackle B.J. Hill (knee), and wide receiver Charlie Jones (groin) did not practice.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

After benching Richardson for veteran Joe Flacco the past two weeks without the desired effect in the win column, Steichen is going back to Richardson for Sunday's trip to East Rutherford, N.J., to battle the New York Jets. Steichen sat Richardson down after a 23-20 loss to the Houston Texans on Oct. 27. Richardson not only struggled with accuracy in that game (10-of-32 passing), but he also took himself out before a key third-down play in the second half, acknowledging he was tired. Flacco threw a combined four interceptions in losses to Minnesota and Buffalo, including a pick-six in last week's 30-20 setback to the Bills on Indianapolis' first play of the game. Steichen said Richardson has taken steps in the right direction while serving as QB2. ""He's made strides in that area, big-time strides, becoming a pro's pro,"" Steichen said. ""Is he a finished product? No, he's not, and it's my job to help him get there. He's going to start this week; he's going to start the rest of the season."" Richardson has completed only 44.4 percent of his 133 passes for 958 yards with four touchdowns and seven interceptions. He's rushed for 242 yards, second on the team, but has fumbled six times in six games. For his part, Richardson said his brief stint on the bench opened his mind. ""I'm thankful for these past two weeks,"" he said. ""As a competitor, you never want to just be on the sideline. You always feel like there's an opportunity for you to go out there and help the team. But sitting on the sideline just allowed me to look and see certain things I can correct about myself."" If Richardson can make those corrections, the Colts (4-6) still have time to catch Houston, which owns a two-game lead over them in the AFC South. Houston swept the season series between the teams. While Richardson returns, Aaron Rodgers continues as the New York quarterback in what's shaping up to be a lost year for a franchise that specializes in lost years. Rodgers mirrored his team's struggles in last week's 31-6 loss at Arizona, managing only 151 yards on 22-of-35 passing but losing 23 yards while taking three sacks. Nevertheless, Rodgers is holding on to hope that the Jets (3-7) can make a run to a playoff spot. ""You know we're not mathematically eliminated,"" he said. ""There's a lot to play for. At the end of the day, one thing we can play for, whether we're 10-0 or 3-7, is pride."" Realistically, New York has played about every card it can to turn things around. It fired coach Robert Saleh after dropping to 2-3 with a Week 5 loss vs. Minnesota but is just 1-4 since installing Jeff Ulbrich as the interim coach. And the acquisition of Davante Adams, Rodgers' favorite target during his days in Green Bay, hasn't helped, either. Even the reliable defense had trouble in Arizona. The Jets gave up 406 total yards and 28 first downs. ""A criminal, egregious amount of missed tackles,"" Ulbrich said. Indianapolis owns a 44-32 lead in the all-time series, including the postseason.

Despite losing two straight contests, the Islanders will look to extend their point streak to five games on Thursday night when they continue a five-game trip by visiting the Vancouver Canucks.  Both teams were off Wednesday after playing the previous night, when the Islanders fell to the Edmonton Oilers 4-3 in overtime and the Canucks recorded a 3-1 win over the visiting Calgary Flames. The Islanders had little chance Tuesday in overtime, when they were outshot 4-0. Bo Horvat, Simon Holmstrom and defenseman Ryan Pulock were on the ice for more than a minute before Leon Draisaitl entered in a shift change, swooped into the New York zone and scored at 1:52 of overtime. ""There's nights where, going home, you're (ticked) off,"" Islanders coach Patrick Roy said. ""There's nights you're going home and you say ‘OK, we stole a point.' Tonight that was the case. By the end I think we were just gassed."" But captain Anders Lee's two goals in the third ensured New York would extend its point streak to four games (2-0-2). The Islanders enter Thursday's game with an NHL-high four ""loser points"" after collecting a league-leading 16 such points last season, when they lost to Carolina in the first round of the playoffs. The 16 losses in overtime or the shootout were the most for a playoff team since the Florida Panthers won the Southeast Division with a 38-26-18 record in 2011-12. ""We pick up points while we're missing a lot of guys,"" Roy said of the Islanders, who have first-liners Mathew Barzal and Anthony Duclair and defenseman Adam Pelech on injured reserve. ""We should gain confidence because we're playing good hockey."" The Canucks also have enjoyed a confidence-boosting stretch following a rough start. Vancouver is 8-2-1 since an 0-1-2 start in which it was outscored 13-8.  The Canucks continued to thrive while playing from behind Tuesday, when they outshot the Flames 12-9 in the first but ended the period trailing 1-0. Justin Kirkland put back the rebound of a shot by Kevin Rooney that glanced off the stick of Vancouver defenseman Quinn Hughes. Elias Pettersson and Pius Suter scored in the first three minutes of the second, when Vancouver outshot Calgary 14-7. ""Really took over in the second period,"" said Canucks center J.T. Miller, who assisted on both goals in the second period. ""I thought we just did a good job of executing the game plan and put it down their throat."" Vancouver has given up the first goal in eight straight games, a span in which the team is 5-2-1. The Canucks have mounted comebacks in five of their eight wins this season. ""Sometimes it happens,"" Miller said. ""It's 60 minutes, and you'd like to start with the lead, but I thought we had a lot of chances right before their goal. And obviously that's a fluky one, so we're not going to worry about it."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

LSU and Kansas State will face each other for the third time ever -- and the third time in the past three seasons -- as LSU travels to Manhattan, Kan., for a Thursday night matchup. Kansas State has won the previous two games.  The two teams met in the championship game of the Cayman Islands Classic in the fall of 2022, with LSU pulling off a thrilling 61-59 victory on a baseline jumper with less than five seconds left.  Last season, the Wildcats defeated the Tigers 75-60 in Baton Rouge, La., behind Louisiana native Cam Carter, one of four Wildcats to score in double figures. Carter now plays for LSU.  LSU (2-0) has started the 2024-25 season strong, partly behind Carter, who has 21 points in each of the Tigers' first two games. In their most recent game, the Tigers used a 19-4 run over a 5:22 stretch in the second half Sunday to erase a six-point halftime deficit and beat Alabama State 74-61.  ""I was really pleased with the final 12 minutes on Sunday,"" LSU Coach Matt McMahon said Tuesday. ""A lot of lessons learned throughout the game, but I really liked the way we finished the game, both offensively and defensively. Now we have this great opportunity to go on the road Thursday against Kansas State.""  Kansas State (2-0) has cruised to two straight wins. In the Wildcats' most recent game, transfer Brendan Hausen was 6-of-9 from 3-point range on his way to a career high 22 points in a 77-64 victory Saturday over Cleveland State.  ""We've got some guys who can make shots,"" Kansas State coach Jerome Tang said. ""Even when we're not playing particularly well, that's what it boils down to. You've got to do some other things too, but if you make shots, it solves a lot of problems."" Tang is downplaying the Carter connection.  ""We love Cam Carter,"" he said. ""He believed in us as a staff when a lot of people didn't. He did a lot for our program. But with the nature of college basketball, he got to capitalize on that and go back closer to home.

But for the past two games, it's turned out well for them in the end. The Kraken rallied for a 5-2 victory against visiting the Columbus Blue Jackets on Tuesday after getting past the Vegas Golden Knights 4-3 in overtime last Friday in the opener of their six-game homestand. Seattle will look for a better start Thursday night when the Chicago Blackhawks come to town. Kraken fourth-liners Brandon Tanev, Yanni Gourde and Tye Kartye have sparked each of the past two victories. Tanev tallied twice and Kartye added an assist against the Golden Knights, then they scored back-to-back against the Blue Jackets to start a four-goal rally in the second period. Gourde added an assist Tuesday, and the trio has a plus-5 rating over the past two games. ""It's obviously not the start we wanted,"" Tanev said after the Kraken were outshot 18-6 by Columbus in the first period. ""But I think we found a way to make some plays, and good things will happen when you're playing the right way."" Tanev's goal, which tied the score at 2-2, came on a two-on-one rush with Gourde. Tanev skated the puck down the right wing, cut laterally through the slot and scored on a wrist shot. ""My goal doesn't happen without Yanni driving the net and clearing space for me,"" Tanev said. ""So there are a lot of good things, simple things that make the game easier for others and especially our teammates. When we're playing that way, the game becomes easier for us."" Ten seconds later, Eeli Tolvanen scored a power-play goal to put the Kraken ahead for good. Kraken coach Dan Bylsma called a timeout after the Blue Jackets tallied twice in a 22-second span in the first period, and Columbus didn't score again. ""I think the attention to our game plan and the attention to the way we wanted to play wasn't nearly good enough,"" Bylsma said. ""The message after the first was, '‘Get your heads up and play.'"" Added Tanev: ""It was simple -- (the first period) wasn't good enough. It was some lazy, sloppy hockey. But I think at the end of the day, we had 40 minutes to figure it out, and I think we definitely did that."" The Blackhawks are coming off a 2-1 overtime victory Sunday against visiting Minnesota, snapping a 12-game losing streak against their division rivals dating to 2020. Philipp Kurashev scored the winner at 1:50 of overtime and Petr Mrazek made 32 saves. ""Yeah, I think it has been tough for us all year to play a full 60 minutes. So we have to find a way to, even if the game is tied, stay in it and not let teams back in it,"" Kurashev said. ""We got away with it (Sunday), but we've got to learn from it."" Jason Dickinson also scored for the Blackhawks, who snapped a two-game skid. ""(Mrazek) was really dialed in and definitely the best player on both teams (Sunday), for sure,"" Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said. ""I thought we played a really solid game, but he was there all game when we needed him. The third period, they kind of turned it on and we stopped making plays, and they had the puck too much and Petr was excellent and kept us in there right to the end."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Nashville's trip started with a 3-2 overtime loss Monday to the Colorado Avalanche. While getting a point and earning three in their last two games (1-0-1), the Predators still sit at the bottom of the Central Division, a far cry from the start the team envisioned after making some high-profile additions to the roster over the summer for coach Andrew Brunette. Despite having just five wins and 12 points through the first 16 games (5-9-2), there is not a lot of panic in the Predators' locker room. During an interview Wednesday morning on the Nashville-based ""Chase and Big Joe Show"" program on 102.5 The Game. Predators center Colton Sissons said it's challenging to play with the speed Brunette wants from his players. ""It took us some time last year, obviously, to understand that and get acclimated to it, but I think it is coming along,"" said Sissons, who scored his second goal of the season in Monday's loss.  ""I mean, it wasn't just the new guys. A lot of us haven't done it to the level that we needed to do it at, obviously, thus far, but it definitely is coming along, especially in the last two games. ""I think there's some chemistry building in some of the lines here, which is good to see and, hopefully, we continue to build that up."" Edmonton has won two straight, including a 4-3 overtime victory Tuesday over the visiting New York Islanders. The Oilers squandered a late 3-1 lead, but the team's top performers secured the second point in the extra session. Leon Draisaitl scored twice, putting him in a three-way tie with an NHL-best 12 goals this season. Defenseman Evan Bouchard added a goal and two assists, and superstar captain Connor McDavid scored once and assisted on the other three goals. The four-point performance from the three-time Hart Memorial Trophy winner puts him at 999 points for his career in 658 games. With his next goal or assist, he'll become the 99th player in NHL history to rack up 1,000 points. Unless McDavid, 27, fails to score a point in any of the next 22 games, he'll become the fourth-fastest player to reach that milestone. ""Every player can have an outstanding game,"" Oiler coach Kris Knoblauch told reporters Wednesday. ""Some players do it once, some a handful of times. But if you're going to be elite and one of the best, you've got to be bringing it almost every single night. And he does that. So, you don't rise up the all-time points leader (category) in that many games unless you're bringing it most nights, and he certainly is."" The Oilers may be down a regular on Thursday after Viktor Arvidsson did not practice. Knoblauch called it a ""maintenance day"" for the 31-year-old Swede, adding that how the left winger feels on Thursday will dictate whether he plays. Thursday may also mark the NHL debut of Nashville defenseman Adam Wilsby, 24, who was called up from the team's American Hockey League affiliate in Milwaukee on Wednesday. The Predators selected Wilsby in the fourth round of the 2020 NHL Draft. He's scored 42 points in parts of three seasons with Milwaukee after playing professionally in his native Sweden. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

That will start to change Thursday night as the Wild return home to host the Montreal Canadiens in St. Paul, Minn. It will be the first home game in nine days for Minnesota, which has played 10 of its first 15 games on the road. In those 15 games, the Wild have recorded at least one point in all but two contests (10-2-3). They are riding a three-game point streak (2-0-1) as they face Montreal. ""We want to play good at home,"" Wild center Joel Eriksson Ek said. ""We want to make something out of this (hot start) and keep this going that way. So, for sure it's going to be important to try to keep the momentum going at home, too."" The Canadiens have had a much bumpier start to the season. They are 1-5-1 in their last seven contests, but they snapped a six-game winless skid with a 7-5 victory against the Buffalo Sabres in their most recent matchup Monday night. Captain Nick Suzuki scored two goals and dished two assists in the victory. Cole Caufield also scored two goals, and former top overall draft pick Juraj Slafkovsky finished with three assists. The performance gave Suzuki 17 points (six goals, 11 assists) in 16 games. ""(Suzuki) needed a game like (Monday night),"" Canadiens coach Martin St. Louis said. ""I'm happy he got that game. As a player, you need those games. ""I think, like everybody, he feels the heat a little bit and to get that game and breathe a little bit, ... this team needed this outcome (Monday), and I think ‘Suzy' needed that, too."" Minnesota is led in scoring by Kirill Kaprizov, who has 28 points (nine goals, 19 assists) in 15 games. He has scored seven times on even strength and two times on the power play. Matt Boldy ranks second with 16 points (nine goals, seven assists) in 15 games. Mats Zuccarello is third on the scoring list with 14 points (six goals, eight assists) in 15 contests. A big key to the Wild's early-season success started in the defensive zone, veteran Marcus Foligno said. The more that Minnesota moved the puck out of its zone and went on the attack, the more it alleviated pressure on its goaltender. ""When we break the puck out fast and then we're making tape-to-tape passes and smart plays, it's like, ‘OK, we've got our game,'"" Foligno said. ""The confidence goes right through the roof. What I want to see at home is when things do go south and we are on our heels a little bit, that we can correct it quickly."" Filip Gustavsson is expected to make his 12th start in net for the Wild. He is 7-2-2 with a 2.27 goals-against average and a .919 save percentage this season. In four career games against the Canadiens, Gustavsson is 1-2-1 with a 3.64 GAA and an .884 save percentage. Sam Montembeault is set to start in goal for Montreal. The 28-year-old is 4-7-1 with a 3.42 GAA and an .890 save percentage in 12 games this season. Montembeault has faced the Wild three times in his career. He is 1-1-1 in those matchups with a 3.60 GAA and an .872 save percentage. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Grant-Foster, the Antelopes' graduate guard who previously played for Kansas and DePaul, has undergone two heart surgeries in recent years. He is cleared to play against the Sun Devils after reaching desirable strength and stamina. Grant-Foster sat out Grand Canyon's opening two regular-season games. Last season, Grant-Foster averaged 20.1 points and 6.1 rebounds per game. ""We're a much better team with Tyon,"" Grand Canyon coach Bryce Drew said. ""The biggest thing is going to be everybody getting used to playing together and the rhythm. The last couple weeks, we haven't got to practice with him as much because we were so focused on our first two games. We've tried to speed things up this week, so hopefully it'll click right away."" Grand Canyon (2-0) defeated Cal State Fullerton 89-79 and Western Kentucky 74-72, both at home, to kick off the campaign. Lopes junior Duke Brennan, a post player who began his career at Arizona State, also missed the first two contests with a left arm injury. His status was undetermined for the Thursday game. Grand Canyon defeated Western Kentucky by scoring eight unanswered points to close the game. Ray Harrison was 1-for-10 from the field before making the game-winning shot on a drive to the basket with 0.4 seconds remaining. Collin Moore (23 points and 10 rebounds) and JaKobe Coles (16 points and 11 rebounds) each had a double-double to lead the Lopes. Arizona State (2-1) is coming off an 88-80 loss Sunday at then-No. 6 Gonzaga, a game in which the Sun Devils were tied with five minutes remaining. The Bulldogs pulled away at the end. Basheer Jihad had 22 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Sun Devils, who shot 53.1 percent from the field in the second half and 47.6 percent for the game. Two days before the defeat, coach Bobby Hurley's Sun Devils beat Santa Clara 81-74 in Henderson, Nev. ""That's the beauty of how we performed this weekend is that both of the teams we played brought a lot of guys back, and we were able to overcome that and certainly be very competitive,"" Hurley said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

On the heels of a 120-112 loss to the visiting Phoenix Suns on Tuesday, the Jazz own an 0-5 record at the Delta Center. That's the worst start on their own court since the franchise moved to Utah in 1979 and matches the all-time worst beginning since the team's first season in New Orleans in 1974. Jazz coach Will Hardy continues to try to remain optimistic during a youth-oriented rebuilding season. Utah has limped out to a 2-8 record, but the team has gone a modest 2-2 since dropping the first six games of the season. After trailing by double digits for most of the night, the Jazz trimmed Phoenix's lead to six when rookie Kyle Filipowski scored on a dunk with 10:18 remaining. ""I think overall there was more good than bad,"" Hardy said. ""The game was decided in the first quarter. They came out with an energy and physicality that we didn't. It just put us behind the curve. Our team stuck with it and continued to fight and compete."" John Collins led Utah with 29 points and 10 rebounds, while Filipowski scored 18 and Lauri Markkanen netted 17. Jordan Clarkson contributed 16 points and eight assists. The Mavericks are coming off of a rough 120-117 loss to the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday in San Francisco. Klay Thompson scored 22 in his celebrated return to his former team's arena, but he was overshadowed by former teammate Stephen Curry and his 37-point outburst. Mavericks star Luka Doncic had a big night in the loss, compiling 31 points, eight rebounds and six assists. He is listed as probable to play Thursday despite a right knee contusion, while teammate P.J. Washington (sprained right knee) was listed as doubtful. Thompson was emotional after returning to San Francisco and seeing his old team and fans. The Warriors gave captain hats to fans in his honor because of his love for boating and as a tribute to how he'd take his boat across the bay to games at the Chase Center. Thompson put Dallas up 110-105 on a 3-pointer with 5:17 left in the fourth quarter, but Curry then scored the final 12 points for the Warriors to spoil his Splash Brother's homecoming. The Mavericks come into Utah on a three-game losing streak, having dropped three nail-biters by a total of six points. Before the defeat to the Warriors, Dallas fell 114-113 at home vs. the Phoenix Suns and then 122-120 at Denver. ""Tonight, this one really stung being up seven with under four minutes left. We'll watch the film and get better,"" Thompson said of the Tuesday setback. ""But I'm really proud of how this team keeps fighting. ""We're still getting to know each other. I keep telling guys it's better to go through this stuff early in the season versus Game 60. I know we have a chance to be great. We have just got to stay the course."" The Mavericks won their first meeting with the Jazz this season, a 110-102 decision on Oct. 28 in Dallas. Kyrie Irving had 23 points, Thompson scored 18 and Doncic totaled 15 points, nine rebounds and eight assists for the hosts. Collin Sexton paced Utah with 23 points. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Now that the NFL's reigning Offensive Player of the Year is back, it's full-speed ahead for the 49ers. With McCaffrey debuting last week after missing the first eight games due to Achilles tendinitis, the 49ers (5-4) won 23-20 at Tampa Bay, posting consecutive victories for the first time this season. They'll look to continue streaking when they play host to the struggling Seattle Seahawks (4-5) on Sunday in Santa Clara, Calif. ""I'm just happy I'm here,"" McCaffery said. ""That was a long journey and a lot of long days, so it feels good to win and it feels good to just play in a football game again."" McCaffrey's contributions were somewhat limited by his unparalleled standards. He rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries and caught six passes for 68 yards. Brock Purdy, who threw for 353 yards and two touchdowns, was happiest to have McCaffrey back in the backfield. ""I think he was awesome,"" Purdy said. ""We had multiple plays with him out of the backfield that were some big plays throwing the ball."" McCaffrey said he tried to stay ""even-keeled"" in his season debut. ""Obviously there's a lot of emotion when you play an NFL football game. So, I just try to let those come naturally,"" McCaffrey said. ""When you miss time due to something like that, nobody wants to be on the field more than me. Just to be out there again, to be honest with you, you really realize how much of a privilege it is to play football."" McCaffrey was listed as limited on the injury report Wednesday, but 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said he'll give the running back regular maintenance days as he works back into the grinding weekly routine. Defensive lineman Nick Bosa (hip) and tight end George Kittle (hamstring) both missed practice time, though Shanahan didn't sound too worried. There is some consternation over the status of punter Mitch Wishnowsky, who aggravated a back injury against the Buccaneers.  Kittle had five catches for 68 yards and two touchdowns as the 49ers won 36-24 at Seattle in Week 6. Last time Seattle saw the 49ers, it was two less-familiar runners ripping apart the Seattle defense.  The Seahawks are coming off a bye and have lost five of six games since a 3-0 start. In the 12-point defeat by San Francisco on Oct. 10, the Seahawks allowed a season-worst 228 rushing yards and 6.9 yards per carry to a 49ers' attack powered by Jordan Mason and Isaac Guerendo. McCaffrey rushed for 259 yards and two touchdowns and caught six passes for 33 yards in two games against the Seahawks in 2023. Seattle's defense ranks 23rd in the NFL in yards allowed (357.6 per game) and 27th against the run (139.4). ""We've got guys that fought, but we have to go to work and make this right because right now we're doing too many things that, it's not winning football, it's not complementary,"" said first-year Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald, who coordinated Baltimore's league-leading defense last season. ""And just the same mentality we've had every week, we've got to keep that going, and we're going to find the solution at some point."" The Seahawks made a surprise move this week by releasing starting linebacker Tyrel Dodson, who led the team in tackles with 71. Seattle wide receiver DK Metcalf was a full participant in practice to start the week, pointing to his probable return after missing the past two games with a knee injury.  Right tackle Abe Lucas (knee) was limited but might make his season debut. Missing practice time were defensive lineman Leonard Williams (foot) and tight ends Noah Fant (groin) and Brady Russell (foot). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Bills (8-2) appear to be the greatest impediment standing in the way of the back-to-back Super Bowl champion Chiefs becoming the first NFL team to go undefeated in the regular season since the New England Patriots in 2007. History and hyperbole are plentiful as the Chiefs (9-0) land in Buffalo for what is being framed as the marquee game of Week 11 and potentially the 2024 regular season. Based on recent matchups between these rivals, the final minutes are likely to be worth the wait yet again in this storybook series. The Chiefs have come from behind eight times this season, while the Bills have won three teams when trailing at the half. It's just the fifth time since 1970 that NFL teams with eight or more wins meet in Week 11 or sooner. The home team won each of the previous four matchups. Kansas City is attempting to become the first team to go undefeated in a 17-game regular season. It's tough to discern where the momentum stands even with the Chiefs entering the game undefeated. They needed a last-second blocked field goal to knock off the Denver Broncos last week, sparking Mahomes to send a warning to his teammates. ""I mean, you're playing the best. The best of the best. That's what you want in this league,"" he said of facing Josh Allen and the Bills. ""I've been able to go up against Josh a multitude of times, and every single game it seems like it comes down to the very end. He is a guy that competes and has that fire. I think you can see that fire that he plays with and that kind of goes through his entire team."" Buffalo, which has won five consecutive wins overall, has claimed the past three regular-season games in the series, all of which were played in Kansas City. And the Bills can still tap into a revenge factor. The eventual repeat Super Bowl champion Chiefs eliminated the Bills in the AFC divisional playoffs 27-24 at Buffalo in January. Despite owning good individual stats against Kansas City, Allen is focusing on the bottom line. ""I know we haven't beat them in the playoffs,"" he said on Wednesday, ""so that's the only thing that really matters."" The matchup features two of the most successful quarterbacks in the NFL: two-time MVP Mahomes and the decorated but overshadowed Allen. Their offenses have been getting the job done in different ways. Although Mahomes has just three more touchdowns (12) than interceptions, Kansas City hangs onto the ball thanks to a league-leading third-down conversion rate (52 percent). The Bills are tied for third in points per game (29) -- the Chiefs average 24.3 -- and Allen didn't throw two picks in a game until a win over the Indianapolis Colts last week. Buffalo leads the NFL in turnover margin at plus-13. And the Bills bring a respectable defense of their own. The group is allowing just 19.3 points per game and has 19 takeaways, the latter figure ranking second in the league. Red-zone defense figures to be paramount against a Chiefs offense that keys off Mahomes' dynamic decision-making and threat to run or unleash brazen throws. Buffalo allows touchdowns on just 47.2 percent of red-zone incursions (eighth in the NFL), while the Chiefs have scored on 53.6 percent of the time (13th). The Kansas City defense, meanwhile, allows just 17.9 points per game (tied for fifth best) and is fourth in yards allowed (289.9). ""I think they do a great job switching the looks that they're giving,"" Allen said. ""Obviously, we know Chris Jones is a game-wrecker, one of the best if not the best interior D linemen in the game right now. You pair that up with some of their DBs and linebackers and they're flying all over the field. ... We're going to have our hands full."" Allen is tied for fourth in the NFL with 17 touchdown passes. All four of his interceptions this season have come in the past three games. ""He's doing a great job with the ball,"" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. ""He's using everybody and he's not forcing anything in there, obviously, so I think he's doing great with his decision-making."" However, Allen's decimated receiving corps will present another difficult scenario against Kansas City. Rookie wide receiver Keon Coleman is out with a wrist injury, wide receiver Amari Cooper (wrist) was a limited participant in practice on Wednesday and tight end Dalton Kincaid (knee) is questionable after sitting out Wednesday. Right tackle Spencer Brown (ankle) also did not practice on Wednesday. The Chiefs reported no significant injuries on Wednesday and actually had encouraging news with defensive end Charles Omenihu (knee) and running back Isiah Pacheco (ankle) returning to practice. Reid said that wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster (hamstring) was closer to returning, whereas Pacheco and Omenihu weren't viewed as candidates to play Sunday. ""We'll see as we go through practice, but if it's up to him, he's back,"" Reid said of Smith-Schuster. After Sunday, the Chiefs finish the regular season with the Panthers, Raiders, Chargers, Browns, Texans, Steelers and Broncos. Those teams have averaged four wins so far this season. Only the Chargers, Texans and Steelers currently have a winning record. Kansas City beat the Chargers 17-10 in Los Angeles on Sept. 29. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Andrej Jakimovski scored 14 of his team-leading 17 points in the first half, and he finished with five of the Buffaloes' 12 3-pointers. Sebastian Rancik and Julian Hammond III each put up 11 points for Colorado (3-0). The Buffaloes improved to 196-40 at home under coach Tad Boyle, including a 99-8 mark in nonconference home games. Donovan Oday led the Titans (0-3) with 13 points and seven rebounds. Cal State Fullerton, after scoring 79 points in its season opener at Grand Canyon, has logged exactly 53 points in each of its past two games. The Titans shot only 31 percent for the game, making 18 of 58 field-goal attempts. They were 2 of 17 (11.8 percent) from 3-point range. The Buffaloes wound up at 56.6 percent from the floor, 12 of 27 (44.4 percent) from long distance. Colorado led by as many as 10 points in the first half, going up 29-19 on Hammond's 3-pointer with 7:17 to play before the break. Then it was 31-21 with big man Bangot Dak's layup at the 5:38 mark. The Buffaloes couldn't pull away before halftime, as the Titans fought back to a four-point deficit. Keith Richard drove for a layup at the 2:12 mark, making the score 33-29. Colorado took a six-point lead into halftime. Jakimovski scored 14 of his points in 11 minutes of playing time in the first half. He knocked down three 3-pointers within the first four minutes of the game, and had four treys for the half. He hit his fifth 3-pointer early in the second half for a 40-29 Colorado lead, and the Buffaloes took off from there. The Titans got within 55-43 on a Freddie Cooper layup with 8:46 to play, but the Buffaloes scored the next nine points to surge ahead comfortably. Later, Hammond collected a rebound at one end and drove for a layup at the other end of the court, and was fouled on the shot. He made the ensuing free throw for a 74-49 lead. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

As luck would have it, the Steelers open division play with a showdown for first place when they host the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday. Pittsburgh certainly has confidence with seven wins in the past eight meetings with Baltimore. The Ravens (7-3) are 2-1 against AFC North opponents and looking to unseat first-place Pittsburgh (7-2). Steelers coach Mike Tomlin isn't the least bit concerned about a schedule that calls for the Steelers to play four straight division opponents and six of eight against the AFC North to end the regular season. ""I don't care,"" Tomlin said on Wednesday. ""I'll play them whenever they schedule us. We've got no control over the schedule. Our goal is to beat everybody, but specifically week to week, we get singly focused on this week's opponent, and so I'd be making it up if I told you I cared about the schedule of when we face people. I don't."" After the tussle with the Ravens, Pittsburgh goes on the road to play the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals before hosting the Browns. The Steelers have thrived no matter the opponent in recent weeks, winning four straight games and averaging 30.8 points during the span. Russell Wilson has been the starter for the past three victories, including a 28-27 road win over the Washington Commanders last week. Baltimore swept two division shootouts against the Bengals -- including a 35-34 home win last week -- and lost to the Browns. While some pointed to a ""soft"" schedule as fuel for the Steelers' fast start, Baltimore began the season with losses to the Kansas City Chiefs and Las Vegas Raiders. The Ravens have won seven of their past eight games with a red-hot offense scoring 28 or more points in all but one contest while averaging 34.4 during that stretch. Lamar Jackson-led Baltimore tops the NFL in both scoring offense (31.8 points per game) and total offense (440.2 yards per game). The Steelers are in second in scoring defense (16.2). Pittsburgh linebacker Patrick Queen spent the previous four seasons as Jackson's teammate. Now he has to figure out how to slow him down. ""He wants to win,"" Queen said of Jackson. ""He'll do whatever it takes to win, and he knows what it takes. So just from my perspective, just going against him, just being able not to tackle him in practice, finally get a chance to actually tackle him, that should be fun. ""He's just a great competitor, he's a great athlete. He can do whatever he wants on the field as we all know. So for me, it's just going against the best."" There is one mark Jackson isn't highly fond of: He is 1-3 all-time as a starting quarterback against the Steelers. Jackson is highly motivated to reverse the trend. ""It's a new year, I'm looking forward to the game,"" Jackson said. ""I'm just focused right now, I'm having fun. I hate everybody in the league -- well, every team in the league -- when I'm going against them."" Whereas the Ravens are introducing Derrick Henry to the division rivalry, this will be the first time the Steelers deploy Wilson at quarterback against Baltimore. Henry leads the NFL in rushing yards (1,120), rushing touchdowns (12) and yards per carry (6.09). Pittsburgh acquired Wilson after he was released by the Denver Broncos in the offseason. ""They're a very good offense. Russ brings a lot to the table, kind of playing the way he plays,"" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said of Wilson. ""We're getting ready to play our best defensive game on Sunday."" Ravens star safety Kyle Hamilton (ankle) missed practice Wednesday. His availability will be firmed up later in the week.

Nick Bjugstad had two goals for Utah, and Michael Kesselring had two assists. Jack McBain and Mikhail Sergachev scored Utah's other goals, both during the third-period flurry. With the game tied 1-1 at 5:09 of the final frame, Kesselring made a great play to take the puck into Carolina's end, and then made a canny pass to McBain for the conversion. Sergachev followed up at the 7:11 mark, and Bjugstad's second goal of the game came just 17 seconds later to put the hosts up 4-1. Martin Necas' second-period power-play goal was the only tally for the Hurricanes, despite a whopping 50-21 shots advantage and six power-play opportunities. Maple Leafs 4, Capitals 3 (OT) John Tavares scored the winner in overtime to complete Toronto's comeback from a two-goal deficit in the third period for a victory at Washington.

The Saints (3-7) will try to continue that success when they host the Cleveland Browns (2-7) on Sunday afternoon. ""Our preparation work last week is the reason we won the game,"" said Rizzi, who was promoted from special teams coordinator when Dennis Allen was fired Nov. 4. ""We had great meetings, we had great practices, we had great walkthroughs and that translated to the field. Our biggest challenge this week is to sustain it."" New Orleans held on to defeat the visiting Atlanta Falcons 20-17 last Sunday. The Falcons threatened three times in the fourth quarter, but Atlanta missed a 46-yard field goal, Tyrann Mathieu intercepted Kirk Cousins and Chase Young's strip sack of Cousins led to Atlanta running out of time. The stops were encouraging for a defense that had allowed the Eagles, Falcons and Panthers to drive to winning scores in the final minutes earlier in the season. ""We ended the game with the defense on the field,"" Rizzi said. ""That goes a long way (toward building confidence)."" But the Saints defense still ranks 24th in scoring, 27th in rushing, 28th in total defense and 29th in pass defense. Atlanta rushed for 181 yards, averaging 5.7 per attempt, and Bijan Robinson had a 37-yard touchdown run. ""We're still not tackling good enough,"" Rizzi said. ""We're still giving up too many rushing yards. We're still giving up too many explosive plays."" New Orleans' run defense might help Cleveland find what it's looking for. Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said a point of emphasis during the bye last week was improving the running game. ""We have to run the ball way more efficiently than we are and find those explosives in the run game,"" Stefanski said. ""We need to lean into the things that we feel our guys do best."" Former Saints quarterback Jameis Winston will make his third consecutive start since Deshaun Watson suffered a season-ending torn Achilles. Winston completed 26 of 46 passes for 235 yards with one touchdown and three interceptions in a 27-10 home loss to the Chargers on Nov. 3. ""I'm grateful for this moment,"" Winston said. ""Opportunities only come so often, so it's definitely a privilege to lead the Cleveland Browns organization and be a starting NFL quarterback. I take pride in that."" Winston, the No. 1 overall pick by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2015 draft, signed with New Orleans as a free agent in 2020 with the expectation that he would be Drew Brees' successor after being his understudy. After throwing 14 touchdowns and just three interceptions in leading the Saints to a 5-2 start in 2021, Winston suffered a knee injury and injuries limited him again in 2022. The Saints signed Derek Carr before last season and Winston backed him up before signing with the Browns as a free agent. Cleveland has won just one time since Week 2, though that was a Winston start, against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 8. ""We cannot fall victim to what's behind us,"" Winston said. ""We cannot (focus on) what's ahead of us. We have to focus on one day and one play, executing perfectly one play at a time."" Two Saints starters missed practice Wednesday -- linebacker Pete Werner (hand) and guard Lucas Patrick (ankle). Starting center Erik McCoy, who hasn't played since suffering a groin injury in Week 3, was limited. No Cleveland starters missed practice. This will be the Browns' first road game since a 20-16 loss to the Eagles on Oct. 13. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Philadelphia fought hard without Joel Embiid (knee), Paul George (knee) and Tyrese Maxey (hamstring) but still lost for the ninth time in 11 games. Rookie Jared McCain took advantage of the available playing time by posting career highs in points (34) and assists (10). Bulls 124, Knicks 123 Coby White made three free throws with 3.2 seconds left to cap his 22-point effort and Chicago rallied after squandering a 22-point lead to beat host New York. After falling behind 90-68 late in the third quarter, New York -- playing the second leg of a back-to-back -- ended the period on a 17-0 run to set up an intense fourth quarter. Jalen Brunson, who scored a pair of go-ahead baskets under duress in the final 38 seconds, created space for a fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, but his attempt rimmed in and out. Had the Knicks completed the comeback, it would have been the franchise's biggest second-half rally since a 26-point turnaround in March 2004.

There were 10 ties and 16 lead changes, with USC going in front for good on Claude's layup with 62 seconds remaining. Teammate Josh Cohen helped free Claude up with a ball screen at the top of the key, then Cohen sealed off the paint to give Claude space to finish at the rim. USC (3-0) regained possession after Raysean Seamster traveled, and Claude connected on a one-footed, running jump shot near the free throw for the last two of his team-high 26 points. The shot gave the Trojans a four-point lead with 19 seconds left, and they needed every bit of it. UT Arlington (1-2) answered with a quick Jaxon Ellingsworth 3-pointer, part of his 19-point performance, to pull within one point. The Mavericks could not bridge the gap any more, however, as Terrance Williams II and Saint Thomas each made their free throws when UT Arlington sent them to the foul line to try extending the game. With his 18 points, Williams joined Claude, Cohen and Wesley Yates III scoring in double figures for the Trojans. Cohen finished with 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting from the floor.

New England hasn't posted back-to-back victories since a three-game winning streak in 2022. The Patriots will attempt to accomplish the feat on Sunday when the Los Angeles Rams roll into Foxborough, Mass. The Patriots (3-7) suffocated the Bears last Sunday, notching a season-high nine sacks from their defense in a 19-3 win. They held Chicago to 142 yards of total offense and 1 of 14 third down conversions. However, considering they haven't had consecutive wins in almost two years, New England coach Jerod Mayo has made it clear to his team that it needs to play with a sense of urgency to stay in the win column. ""Big win from there, and just build on it,"" Patriots quarterback Drake Maye said. ""Sense of urgency, what coach Mayo is preaching. I think it starts with cleaning up from the game (last) Sunday, cleaning up some little things that I think we could have ended up being a bigger margin of victory for us, especially offensively. ""I think we've got another chance here at home. L.A.'s coming off a short week, so we've got to prepare for them. They're good up front on defense, so we're preparing for them."" Los Angeles has a quicker-than-usual turnaround following a 23-15 loss to the Miami Dolphins on Monday night. The Rams (4-5) were never able to find the end zone, getting five field goals from Joshua Karty to at least keep the game competitive. It marked the end of a three-game winning streak for Los Angeles, which is still within striking distance of the Arizona Cardinals (6-4) for the lead in the NFC West. Rams linebacker Jared Verse realizes that time is of the essence when it comes to making a playoff push, though. ""We can't dwell on this (loss against Miami), ‘Oh no, woe is me,' "" Verse said. ""We have to move on."" Verse was among the few bright spots for Los Angeles against the Dolphins. The rookie had four tackles (two for loss), one sack, one forced fumble and a fumble recovery. Still, Verse believes he can be even better against the Patriots. ""I'll never be satisfied with the way I play,"" he said. ""I think there were definitely a couple plays here and there that I could have made if I did a little bit more."" Offensive linemen Joe Noteboom and Rob Havenstein are both dealing with ankle injuries that forced them to miss practice on Wednesday.

Rantanen added an assist, Nathan MacKinnon had three assists and Alexandar Georgiev turned away 13 shots for Colorado. Los Angeles goaltender Darcy Kuemper made 18 saves before leaving early in the third period with an apparent injury. Kuemper motioned to an official that he was injured and was replaced by David Rittich at 4:34 of the third. Rittich had four saves. The game was tied when Rantanen beat Rittich from the slot at 10:01 of the third. He scored into an empty net for his second hat trick of the season. He has 12 goals. Adrian Kempe had two goals and Trevor Moore and Anze Kopitar had two assists for the Kings, who didn't record a shot on goal in the second period. Los Angeles wasted no time in getting on the board. Moore passed the puck to Kempe below the right circle, he took a shot on goal that Georgiev stopped but Kempe put in his own rebound at 32 seconds. Colorado responded a few minutes later when Rantanen took a shot from the left circle that Kuemper saved with his glove but the rebound came out and Lehkonen tapped it in just inside the right post at 3:40. It was his third of the season. The Kings went back in front late in the first when Moore fed Kopitar in the left circle, Kopitar passed it to Kempe through the slot, and Kempe knocked it into the open net at 15:51. It was his seventh of the season. Colorado controlled the play in the second period and got the only power play but couldn't generate any chances. The Avalanche eventually tied it when Cale Makar hit Rantanen with a stretch pass at the Kings' blueline, and he beat Kuemper over his right shoulder at 16:07. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Tomas Hertl and Nicolas Roy also scored goals and Shea Theodore had two assists for Vegas, which improved to 25-7-1 all-time against the Ducks (including 11-4-1 at the Honda Center). It was just the second road win of the season for the Golden Knights (2-3-2). Brock McGinn and Frank Vatrano scored goals and Brett Leason had two assists for Anaheim, which lost for the fifth time in its last six games (1-4-1). Lukas Dostal finished with 37 saves. Anaheim took a 1-0 lead at the 17:39 mark of the first period when McGinn snapped in a rebound of a Pavel Mintyukov shot from the low slot for his third goal of the season. Vegas tied it just 92 seconds later on Roy's fifth goal. Theodore set up the score circling around along the left boards and then passing the puck to Roy in the crease where he tapped it past Dostal on the goaltender's blocker side. The Golden Knights took a 2-1 lead midway through the second period on a power-play goal by Hertl, who roofed a rebound of a Jack Eichel shot for his fifth goal. It was Hertl's first goal in eight games and his fourth on the power play. Dorofeyev made it 3-1 early in the third period with his team-leading ninth goal, intercepting an attempted clearing pass by Isac Lundestrom in the slot and then knocking in a rebound of his own shot. The Ducks closed to 3-2 with 13.4 seconds left when Vatrano finished an odd-man rush with a wrist shot past Hill's blocker side for his second goal of the season. But Anaheim, despite pulling Dostal for an extra attacker, couldn't manage to get a shot off in the closing moments. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Lions managed to extend their winning streak to seven games on Sunday night even though Jared Goff was picked off five times and they trailed by 16 points at halftime. Jake Bates hit a pair of 50-plus yard field goals in the fourth quarter, including the final play of the game, as the Lions pulled out a 26-23 win over Houston. The Lions (8-1), who hold the top spot in the NFC, now host struggling Jacksonville on Sunday afternoon. Another victory would give the Lions their longest winning streak during the Super Bowl era. ""We're going to get everybody's best shot and you have to understand that we have to assume that we will get the best version of what they are and what they're capable of,"" coach Dan Campbell said. ""So, with that, we have to be on our game, and it really is about yourself and it's about the details to what we do."" Goff hadn't thrown an interception in the Lions' previous five games and will look to be more efficient against the Jaguars. ""There's a million things that we can improve on, that I can improve on, that we're going to have to improve on if we want to continue on the trend we're on,"" Goff said. Defensive lineman Za'Darius Smith is expected to make his Lions debut on Sunday. He was acquired at the trade deadline from Cleveland to fortify the pass rush. ""I'm looking for a complementary piece and somebody that's going to be able to help our defense, that's going to elevate us a little bit and I think that he'll do that for us,"" Campbell said. The Jaguars (2-8) will be without their starting quarterback again this week. Trevor Lawrence will miss his second straight game with a shoulder injury. Mac Jones will fill in once again as Jacksonville looks to snap a three-game losing streak ahead of its bye next week. Jones' first start with the Jaguars didn't go too well. He threw for 111 yards and two interceptions in a 12-7 loss to Minnesota last Sunday. The team's top wide receivers, Brian Thomas Jr. and Gabe Davis, were limited to a combined three receptions. ""I thought we played with good tempo in and out of the huddle,"" Jones said. ""Obviously, there are a lot of things to work on throughout the game but it boils down to finishing better by me. I thought I left three plays out there and if you change those three plays then maybe the outcome's a little different."" He'll now face a ball-hawking pass defense that's tied for second in the league with 13 interceptions. ""They're sound all around,"" Jones said of the Lions' defense. ""They do everything well together and they play very physical. It's a physical group. The fan base is awesome and playing at Ford Field will be great and I feel like that whole city embodies football and tough football."" Running back Tank Bigsby suffered an ankle injury in the Vikings' contest and didn't practice on Wednesday. That could mean a heavier workload for Travis Etienne Jr., who was held to 44 yards on 11 carries by Minnesota. Bigsby and Lawrence were the only Jaguars players to miss practice Wednesday. Detroit had a walkthrough on Wednesday and the lone non-participant was tight end Sam LaPorta, who departed Sunday's game early in the second half with a shoulder injury. Offensive tackle Taylor Decker missed the game with a shoulder injury but Campbell is optimistic he'll play against Jacksonville. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Rui Hachimura had 19 points and Austin Reaves scored 18 for the Lakers, including a decisive 3-pointer with 1:09 remaining for a 124-117 lead. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 29 points and Scotty Pippen Jr., Santi Aldama and Marcus Smart each added 15 points as the Grizzlies saw their season-best three-game winning streak come to an end. Memphis played without Ja Morant (hip) for the third consecutive game and also was without Brandon Clarke (toe) and Desmond Bane (oblique).

Miami (3-6) snapped a three-game losing streak this past Monday with a 23-15 road win against the Los Angeles Rams. The Raiders (2-7) are coming off an eventful bye week and hope to snap their own losing streak, currently at five games. Las Vegas coach Antonio Pierce said Wednesday the Raiders are sticking with Gardner Minshew as their starting quarterback in the hopes of stopping the skid. Minshew has already been benched at two different points this season and has 12 turnovers, which ranks second in the NFL. Minshew has completed 67 percent of his passes (148 for 221) for 1,501 yards, six touchdowns and eight interceptions with an 80.2 passer rating this season. ""Listen, when we brought in Gardner, we expected, obviously, the play that we had seen in the past and at some point, you've got to give a guy confidence,"" Pierce said. ""And there's been times, obviously, with turnovers and other things that have taken place, where we made decisions to either put him on the bench or go to another quarterback."" Minshew was most recently benched in the second half of the Raiders' loss to Cincinnati Bengals in Week 9. The recently signed Desmond Ridder took over in his place. Since the loss, the Raiders have made several personnel moves. Offensive coordinator Luke Getsy, offensive line coach James Cregg and quarterbacks coach Rich Scangarello were all fired. The Raiders elevated Scott Turner to interim offensive coordinator and made former Miami Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin their interim offensive line coach. Las Vegas also hired veteran coach Norv Turner, Scott's father, as senior adviser. The Dolphins' defense held things together through the team's rough start this season. On Monday, the unit sacked Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford four times, forced two turnovers and kept Los Angeles out of the end zone. Miami's offense continues to regain some rhythm as Tua Tagovailoa prepares to make his fourth start since returning from the concussion he suffered in Week 2 against Buffalo. Since his return, Tagovailoa has completed 73 of 94 passes for 672 yards, four touchdowns and one interception. ""I just know there's been an urgency for us to turn our season around and we've looked at it like we are trying to turn each day around, trying to fix each day of prep, fix everything that we can learn from from the game situations and how the prep relates and how we're applying our prep to the games in the realest form, not just saying ‘I want to win,' "" Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said. The Dolphins got some bad news this week regarding their offensive line. Starting right tackle Austin Jackson was placed on injured reserve and is out for the season following a knee injury. Kendall Lamm will likely fill in again with rookie Patrick Paul backing him up. As of Wednesday, offensive lineman Robert Jones (knee), wide receiver Tyreek Hill (wrist) and cornerback Kendall Fuller (concussion) did not practice for the Dolphins. For the Raiders, centers Andre James (ankle) and Cody Whitehair (ankle), cornerback Nate Hobbs (ankle) and tight end Harrison Bryant (ankle) did not practice. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Dalano Banton scored 13 points for Portland, which won consecutive games for the first time this season. Toumani Camara had 11 points, eight rebounds and three steals and Scoot Henderson also had 11 points for the Trail Blazers.

However, Sharpe made two free throws and Banton converted a three-point play to push the margin to 10 with 16.5 seconds left to put it away.

The Trail Blazers moved ahead for the first time at 44-42 on Camara's putback with 2:38 remaining in the half. The score was tied at 48 at the break.

Fox, who also found time for a game-high 10 assists, and Domantas Sabonis (11 points, team-high 10 rebounds) recorded double-doubles for the Kings, who beat the Suns a second straight time after winning 127-118 in overtime in Phoenix on Sunday. Despite playing without injured Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, the Suns hung tough and got within 98-90 after a driving hoop by Devin Booker three minutes into the fourth quarter before running out of gas. Also short-handed with the absence of injured Malik Monk and having lost DeMar DeRozan to a sore back in the first half, Sacramento saved its best basketball for the final nine minutes, outscoring the visitors 29-14. The decisive run began with a 12-0 burst that featured 3-pointers by Huerter and Keon Ellis, blowing the game open at 110-90 with just 5:55 remaining. Fox shot 11-for-17, Huerter 9-for-16 and Keegan Murray 7-for-11 (17 points) for the Kings, who outshot the visitors 64.1 percent to 37.1 percent.

The Minnesota Vikings would prefer to avoid having to pull off that trick for a second week in a row. Minnesota (7-2) will look to wake up its offense when it visits the Tennessee Titans (2-7) on Sunday afternoon in Nashville. The Vikings are coming off a 12-7 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in which all of their scoring consisted of four field goals. Sam Darnold did not help matters at quarterback as he threw a pair of interceptions in the Jaguars end zone. Darnold has six turnovers in his past two games. Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell wants Darnold and the rest of the offense to take better care of the ball this weekend at Tennessee. ""We're doing a lot of little things that normally lead to having good chances to win,"" O'Connell said. ""But clearly the turnovers are keeping these games very close and relying on other aspects of our team to overcome for that. We need to score points. We need to finish these drives. ""What you can't have is turnovers in the opposing team's end. You're limiting your opportunity to add three, seven, three, seven. Those things add up with the way our defense has played the last couple weeks. So, we've got to do a better job collectively as a group -- myself, our staff, and then our players and clearly Sam."" Meanwhile, look for Tennessee to focus on takeaways as it looks to bounce back from a loss last week against the Los Angeles Chargers. The Titans have lost four of their past five contests, and they are 1-3 on their home field entering the weekend. Titans quarterback Will Levis is expected to make his second straight start since returning from a shoulder injury. He has a modest 79.6 passer rating this season while throwing for 874 yards, seven touchdowns and seven interceptions. Will the remaining eight games in the regular season be enough for Titans coach Brian Callahan and his staff to determine whether Levis is the franchise quarterback going forward? ""It's hard to put a timeline on that,"" Callahan said this week. ""For me, I'm looking for things every game, every practice. If he improves the play that he had last week, we're all going to feel really good about how he's played the position through two games back (from injury). We're just going to keep stacking those games."" Tony Pollard leads the Titans with 666 rushing yards and three touchdowns but has been hindered by a foot injury. Calvin Ridley is the team's No. 1 wide receiver with 32 catches for 483 yards and three scores. The Vikings also are banged up in the backfield as Aaron Jones was limited in practice to start the week because of a rib injury. Jones has rushed for 653 yards and two touchdowns this season. Justin Jefferson has a team-high 53 catches for 831 yards and five touchdowns in the first nine games of the season. He is looking to bounce back from a season-low of 48 receiving yards against Jacksonville last week. This is the first matchup between the teams since Sept. 27, 2020, when the Titans earned a 31-30 win.

The Chicago Bears (4-5) can't get much right lately, especially on offense, where new coordinator Thomas Brown is tasked with sparking a rapid turnaround against the visiting Packers (6-3). After scoring at least 24 points in four of its past five games, Green Bay had little trouble moving the ball. Meanwhile, additional rest has allowed quarterback Jordan Love to create distance from knee and groin injuries that hobbled him during the first half of the season. ""Certainly, when you're limited in your lower half as a quarterback, really any type of thrower, that can have a big effect on your ability to just move around in the pocket or throw accurately,"" Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. ""So, it'll be good to just get him some practice under his belt where he's fully healthy."" Offensive struggles continue to plague quarterback Caleb Williams and Chicago. The Bears allowed 10 sacks the past two games and scored just 27 points during the three-game losing streak they'll carry into their first NFC North game of the season. Some Bears fans chanted for coach Matt Eberflus' firing during a 19-3 loss to struggling New England at Soldier Field last week. He's 0-4 against the Packers. On Tuesday, the organization sacked offensive coordinator Shane Waldron instead.  An attack led by Williams, the No. 1 overall draft pick, and flanked by multiple offseason acquisitions has sputtered to an average of 277.6 yards per game, third lowest in the league, and enters Sunday on a streak of 23 straight possessions without a touchdown. The Bears are treading water in the division but opportunities to jump in the standings will be plentiful starting Sunday. After hosting the Packers, the Bears take on the Vikings (7-3), pay a Thanksgiving Day visit to the Detroit Lions (8-1) and start December with a trip to San Francisco (5-4). If they stay on their feet during that run, they'll get all three division opponents and the Seattle Seahawks before the regular season ends.  Injuries along the offensive line haven't helped, leading to 38 sacks of Williams. Last week he started behind a line featuring two backup tackles. On Wednesday, Chicago released veteran guard Nate Davis, who signed a three-year, $30 million deal before last season. Eberflus reiterated that he made the decision to fire Waldron. While players vented frustrations about the offense, they didn't ask that Waldron be removed. ""They just want to do more,"" Eberflus said. ""Individually and as a group. They want to be more productive. More effective. Score points for our football team."" Brown will pivot from passing game coordinator to take the reins as offensive coordinator. He was promoted to offensive coordinator during the season with the Carolina Panthers last season. Green Bay has dominated the NFL's oldest rivalry lately. The Packers boast a 10-game winning streak against the Bears, tied for most in the series and leading the way as the league's longest current win streak by one team against an opponent. The Packers have outscored the Bears by 127 points over that span behind an opportunistic offense and a defense that has limited Chicago to 20 points or less eight times while amassing a plus-19 turnover differential. Green Bay, which has captured three of the past five NFC North titles, is off to a rare 0-2 start in the division but won four of five overall. The Packers lost 24-14 to the Lions in Week 9 but had more total yards, 411-261. ""We've been pretty good as a unit and it's crazy, because it's like we could be so much better,"" Packers running back Josh Jacobs said. ""So, I think that's the fun part about the back end of the season is trying to chase the perfection."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Lots of zeros. According to a report in The Telegraph of London on Wednesday, U.S. players competing at the event will get roughly $400,000 apiece. The pay structure, according to The Telegraph, would be similar to that of the Presidents Cup in September -- a stipend as opposed to a contribution made to the charity of each golfer's choice. However, there are two primary differences between the Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup, according to The Telegraph. First, the amount. The Presidents Cup stipend was $250,000. Second, who is getting paid. While players and captains for both teams were paid at the Presidents Cup in Montreal, the European Ryder Cup golfers will not get paid -- instead opting to play for what European captain Luke Donald called ""passion"" for golf and country. ""It's one week where you play for more than yourself,"" Donald told The Telegraph. ""It's ... not about money or points, it's about coming together as a team and the fans feed off that -- it's all passion. I don't think we should ever get paid."" Talks of Americans getting paid for the Ryder Cup have been brewing for decades. In 1999 at Brookline, Mass. (one of the most famous Ryder Cup weekends in the event's history), golfers including Tiger Woods voiced their opinions on players not being paid despite the event raking in several million dollars. ""I would like to see us receive whatever the amount is, whether it's $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 and I think we should be able to keep the money and do whatever we see fit,"" Woods told The Washington Post in 1999. ""I personally would donate all of it to charity. With all the money that's being made, we should have a say in where it goes."" The charitable donations began being made that same year. Pay-for-play at the Ryder Cup became a hot-button topic during last year's competition near Rome after American Patrick Cantlay did not wear a hat during Saturday's play. Multiple reports stated he did not wear the hat as a protest for players not being paid. Cantlay denied that being the reason, instead saying the hat just did not fit. Said one anonymous European player to The Telegraph: ""(The Americans) can do whatever they want. But we don't want payments in our bank accounts, as it'll be the thin end of the wedge and is not what the Ryder Cup is about. ""Let's face it, a lot of the American players have been angling towards this for years, if not decades. ""If it does go ahead, then it will be interesting to see how the fans react at Bethpage, although they'll probably announce it as just an extension of what already happens."" The 2025 Ryder Cup is scheduled to take place Sept. 23-28. The Americans hold a 27-14 advantage all time in the event, though the Europeans have won five of the last seven contests, including a 16 1/2-11 1/2 win at Marco Simone Golf and Country Club in Italy in 2023. The U.S. team will be captained by Keegan Bradley in 2025. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Nick Bjugstad had two goals for Utah, and Michael Kesselring had two assists. Jack McBain and Mikhail Sergachev scored Utah's other goals, both during the third-period flurry. Martin Necas' second-period power-play goal was the only tally for the Hurricanes, despite a whopping 50-21 shots advantage and six power-play opportunities. With the game tied 1-1 at 5:09 of the final frame, Kesselring made a great play to take the puck into Carolina's end, and then made a canny pass to McBain for the conversion. Sergachev followed up at the 7:11 mark, and Bjugstad's second goal of the game came just 17 seconds later to put the hosts up 4-1. Playing in just his fifth game of the season, Utah backup goalie Vejmelka delivered a career night. Vejmelka and the Utah Hockey Club's defenders had to be spectacular during an extended penalty kill in the third period. A fighting/game-misconduct penalty to Michael Carcone formed the bulk of nine minutes of power-play time for Carolina in the final frame, yet the Hurricanes couldn't add another goal. Carolina lost for just the second time in its past 11 games (9-2-0). Hurricanes starting goalie Pyoty Kochetkov stopped 15 of 18 shots in 46:45 of ice time, and Spencer Martin stopped 2 of 3 shots in a relief effort. Defenseman Sean Walker accidentally collided with Kochetkov on McBain's goal, and a shaken-up Kochetkov was removed from the game after Sergachev's tally. Bjugstad opened the scoring at 17:55 of the first period. Bjugstad's goals were his first two of the season, after the veteran forward missed the Utah Hockey Club's first eight games due to an upper-body injury. Necas has 22 points (eight goals, 14 assists) over a career-best 11-game points streak. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Asked Wednesday whether he expects to play again next year, Rodgers replied, ""I think so, yeah."" The 40-year-old veteran added, ""I'm not playing as well as I would've liked to play, for sure. The beauty in this game is it's a team game. The frustrating part is that if you're a great competitor, you hold yourself to a standard that's not unrealistic, and I haven't reached that standard this year."" Rodgers returned this year after missing all but four plays of his first season in New York in 2023, when he tore his left Achilles tendon in the season opener. His comeback season hasn't gone according to plan, though. Rodgers ranks 23rd in the NFL in passer rating at 86.8. He has completed 62.4 percent of his passes for 2,258 yards and 15 touchdowns with seven interceptions -- with his completion percentage, yards per completion and touchdown rate ranking among the lowest of his 20-year career. The Jets, who entered the season with high expectations, own a 3-7 record. Commenting on whether the team's struggles are impacting his view on his future, Rodgers said, ""Not really, not for the negative. Not really, no."" Rodgers is under contract for next season with a $2.5 million base salary plus a $35 million option bonus. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

It was Antetokounmpo's ninth 50-plus outing and the second best of his career, after his 64-point effort against Indiana last season. The two-time MVP hit 21 of 34 from the field, 16 of 17 from the foul line, and had 14 rebounds, seven assists and three blocks. Brook Lopez provided the support with 29 points. Cade Cunningham had 35 points and 11 assists for the Pistons, while Malik Beasley hit eight 3-pointers in his 26-point haul. Antetokounmpo's big evening was almost ruined when he was whistled for a foul with one second left in regulation, and the score was tied at 111, sending Ronald Holland to the free-throw line. Bucks coach Doc Rivers challenged the call unsuccessfully but Holland missed both foul shots, forcing the extension, which Antetokounmpo dominated with 11 points. Antetokounmpo was unguardable from the outset, attacking the Pistons with 22 first-quarter points, but Milwaukee received virtually no other offensive production early. Two Lopez free throws were the only other scores for the Bucks who, Antetokounmpo aside, were 0-for-12 from the floor. Beasley caught fire from the perimeter in the second term against his old side, his corner triple in the closing moments capping a 7-0 run to give Detroit a 60-47 halftime advantage. The Pistons were 8 of 13 from downtown at the half. Detroit's lead swelled to 18 points in the third before the Bucks mounted a sustained fightback, aided by the ejection of Pistons power forward Isaiah Stewart with 3:02 remaining in the third. Stewart had grabbed Antetokounmpo's jersey and yanked him to the ground. Lopez drained a 30-footer in the closing moments of the quarter to cap a 33-14 run and give Milwaukee its first lead. The 7-footer was doing it at both ends, knocking down his fourth triple early in the fourth, then rejecting Cunningham's dunk attempt. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Ben Humrichous added 10 points and six rebounds for Illinois (3-0), which shot a season-low 41.8 percent from the field and committed 18 turnovers against Oakland's matchup zone. Jayson Woodrich paced Oakland (1-2) with 11 points before leaving with 3:28 left with a left shoulder injury. DQ Cole added 10 points and four steals, but the Golden Grizzlies also had 18 turnovers and followed up last week's 3-for-26 3-point shooting at Boise State by going 4-for-25 versus Illinois. Illinois built a 9-5 lead by the first media timeout, then inserted Will Riley into the lineup. The Big Ten's reigning freshman of the week drilled a step-back 3-pointer on his first touch, then added an 8-foot runner and two free throws to cap a three-minute stretch that pushed Illinois' margin to 18-9. Illinois extended the lead to 22-9 when Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn swiped a pass and broke away from a two-handed jam at the 10:52 mark. Oakland responded with 10 straight points in just 2:11 to cut the margin to 22-19. Tuburu Naivalurua started the spree with a jumper, Woodrich finished it with a driving layup and Malcolm Christie added four free throws along the way -- two when Illinois coach Brad Underwood was hit with a technical. Illinois quelled the rally with back-to-back 3-pointers by Kylan Boswell and Tre White, but Naivalurua and teammate Allen Mukeba threw down violent dunks in the final two minutes of the half to pull the Golden Grizzlies within 36-29 at the break. The teams combined for 22 turnovers in the first half, then Illinois committed two miscues in the first 66 seconds of the second half to enable Oakland to pull within two. The first turnover came when Mukeba poked away a pass and raced ahead of the pack for a fierce dunk, then a steal by Cole turned into two Woodrich free throws to make it 38-36 with 18:34 left. That's when Illinois spread the floor and fed Ivisic at the free-throw line, where he could go one-on-one. The lefty sank two jumpers and a layup to help the Fighting Illini rebuild a 49-38 lead with 15:02 to play. Oakland never got within single digits again as both teams went cold. The Illini missed 10 of 11 shots at one point, and the Golden Grizzlies 11 of 12.  Boswell sank two free throws and a 3-pointer, then a no-look pass by Kasparas Jakucionis set up a dunk by Ivisic to make it 66-49 with 1:39 to go. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

After overcoming a two-goal deficit in the third period of a win over the St. Louis Blues on Tuesday, the Bruins look to complete their two-game road trip on another high note Thursday against the Dallas Stars. St. Louis used power-play goals to take a 2-0 lead through two periods, but Morgan Geekie, Charlie McAvoy and David Pastrnak all scored in the final frame to turn the game around. The win was Boston's fourth in six games (4-1-1) following a previous 1-4-1 stretch. An identity that coach Jim Montgomery had emphasized of late showed through. ""We talked about staying with it for 60 minutes and playing the right way,"" Montgomery said. ""And even though we made a couple of mistakes in the third still -- because you're going to make mistakes, it's a game of mistakes -- we just kept battling. ... We got to the goal line and got some greasy goals."" Pastrnak scored the game-winner with 1:47 remaining, completing the Bruins' first third-period comeback from multiple goals since Nov. 1, 2022. McAvoy matched him with a two-point effort. McAvoy believes that win can lead to more in Dallas and moving forward to a three-game homestand, which begins with a Saturday rematch against the Blues. ""You've got to do the right things moving forward, but there's a couple times throughout a (season) where you ... come back and find a way like we did (Tuesday), and you can really build off those,"" McAvoy said. Defenseman Hampus Lindholm was lost to a lower-body injury during Tuesday's game and will miss ""weeks,"" leading the Bruins to recall Jordan Oesterle from Providence of the AHL, where he recorded three goals and eight points in nine games. The 32-year-old Oesterle, who Montgomery described as a smart player and excellent skater, has played in 371 career NHL games, most recently with the Calgary Flames last season. The Stars have won two of three since returning from the NHL Global Series in Finland and were last in action Monday at Pittsburgh, scoring six straight first-period goals en route to a 7-1 drubbing of the Penguins. ""It was a good step in the right direction,"" center Matt Duchene said. ""We know what to expect from Boston. It's never an easy game. No matter how well or not well they're playing, they're always a tough team. ... Our compete and details have to be there."" Defenseman Miro Heiskanen was the lone repeat scorer in Pittsburgh, helping Dallas become the first NHL team to rattle off six goals during the opening period of any game since the 2022-23 season. ""It's nice for a bunch of the guys to get on the board and kind of feel good about ourselves,"" left winger Mason Marchment said. ""I thought, right from the start of the game, we were on it."" Marchment notched a goal and four assists, with four of his five points coming in the first. Prior to Monday, Dallas had lost three of four and gone three consecutive games without scoring more than three goals. The seven-goal total was its highest since a 5-2 win in Boston Oct. 24 in which Duchene and Tyler Seguin each registered a goal and two assists. ""We haven't had one of those games all year, we had some bounces and some seeing-eye goals,"" coach Pete DeBoer said. ""We had some guys who really needed a goal, so that was much needed."" Wyatt Johnston snapped a 10-game goal drought on Monday, while fellow 21-year-old Logan Stankoven scored for the second time in three games and now has 13 points to lead all NHL rookies. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Aranguren had 13 points and Seton Hall transfer Jaquan Sanders added 12 points for Hofstra (3-0). Chaunce Jenkins had 18 points and Dylan Addae-Wusu finished with 11 points for Seton Hall, which has lost two straight and is 1-2 for the first time since 2020-21. Seton Hall led 24-22 following a sludgy first half in which the teams shot a combined 31.5 percent (17-for-54), including 25.9 percent (7-for-27) from 3-point land. Sanders hit a driving layup and Cruz Davis dunked following a steal at midcourt to put Hofstra up 40-39 with 5:12 left. Sanders' basket was preceded by a nine-second stretch in which the Pirates missed 5 of 6 free throws. Seton Hall's Prince Aligbe and Aranguren traded layups before the teams turned the ball over on consecutive possessions.

Tavares, who also had an assist, broke into the offensive zone to collect Mitch Marner's backhand clear and slid it five-hole on Logan Thompson with 47 seconds left in overtime. William Nylander had a goal and an assist for the Maple Leafs, who have won four of their last five games. Joseph Woll made 24 saves. Nylander made it 3-2 at 15:51 of the third period when he pushed in a Matthew Knies shot that had trickled behind Thompson. After Knies had a tying goal waved off for a high stick, Marner's one-timer on the power play from the left circle with Woll pulled for the extra attacker knotted it 3-3 with 48 seconds left. Aliaksei Protas had a goal and an assist, and Thompson made 30 saves for the Capitals. Taylor Raddysh gave Washington a 1-0 lead at 11:12 of the first period when his centering pass hit the skate of Toronto's Max Domi and deflected blocker side on Woll. The Maple Leafs responded 59 seconds later. Tavares cut around defenseman Matt Roy in the left circle and fed Bobby McMann, who was alone in front to snap it through Thompson and tie it 1-1. Dylan Strome put the Capitals in front 2-1 at 18:33. The center took a pass from Protas to the net and, after showing backhand, went to his forehand to slip it by the left skate of Woll. After a Washington goal midway through the second period was overturned on a Maple Leafs challenge for goaltender interference, Protas got one that counted for a 3-1 advantage at 17:48. His pass intended for Alex Ovechkin down low was blocked, and Rasmus Sandin collected it and threaded it back to Protas, who quickly fired it glove side from the bottom of the right circle. Toronto appeared to pull within one midway through the third courtesy of Steven Lorentz, but the call was reversed after video review determined Lorentz propelled the puck in with his leg. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Houston opened the fourth quarter with a 9-0 run that yielded a 98-79 lead. The Clippers then went deep into their bench only for those reserves -- Kobe Brown, Jordan Miller and Bones Hyland -- to key a rally and close the deficit to 107-103 on two Hyland free throws with 1:42 left. But Sengun (13 points, 11 rebounds) delivered his driving dunk before Tari Eason (18 points, 10 rebounds) added another in transition to seal the victory. Amen Thompson (18 points, 11 rebounds), like Eason, posted a double-double off the bench for Houston, which received 15 points, five rebounds and five assists from Fred VanVleet, who missed Monday's win over the Wizards with an injury. Houston produced a 59-42 rebounding advantage and scored 19 second-chance points. James Harden led the Clippers with 19 points and seven assists while Terance Mann added 14 points and seven rebounds off the bench. Norman Powell scored 13 points but missed 13 of 18 shots. The Clippers' scorching start yielded a double-digit lead before the halfway mark of the first quarter. When Harden completed a four-point play with 7:02 left in the period, it capped a 5-for-5 start from deep for the Clippers, who extended to an 11-point lead before Houston roared back. The Rockets' 12-0 run late in the first offset that run of 9-0 by the Clippers, with Thompson and VanVleet playing roles in the waning moments that allowed Houston to pull even at 28-28 entering the second, during which the momentum swings continued. Amir Coffey and Mann teamed for 14 points off the bench and a transition alley-oop that pushed the Clippers to a 45-43 lead at the 7:25 mark. The Rockets responded with back-to-back 3s from VanVleet and Jabari Smith Jr. VanVleet delivered a 3-pointer and driving layup down the stretch to supply the Rockets a 61-56 lead at the intermission, closing a half that featured 10 lead changes and nine ties and included the teams shooting a combined 19 for 39 from deep. Eason scored eight points during a 10-2 run that closed the third quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

He scored on a wrist shot from the bottom of the left circle off the rush. It broke a scoreless streak of nearly 112 minutes for Detroit, dating back to the second period of Friday night's 3-1 loss to the host Toronto Maple Leafs.  Kane then put in a one-timer from the bottom of the right circle, converting a pass from Dylan Larkin, for his third goal of the season. The Penguins then scored twice in the period to tie it. Rust cut in off the left wing, going around Red Wings' defenseman Moritz Seider. Rust then skated across the top of the crease and swept a forehand shot past Talbot at 7:19 of the middle period. It was Rust's fourth goal.  Beauvillier made it 2-2 just over five minutes later when he scored from the bottom of the right circle for his fifth goal.

Chance McMillian had 16 points and was 4-for-4 from deep for the Red Raiders, who are 3-0 and were just outside of the AP Top 25 this week. It was the Red Raiders' 33rd consecutive home nonconference victory. Wyoming suffered its first defeat. The Cowboys were led by Obi Agbim with 15 points. Wyoming took its only lead of the contest 9-8 when Kobe Newton made a long 3-pointer with the shot clock running down and 16:40 left in the first half. The next nine minutes were marked by an incident at halfcourt. Cowboys guard Dontaie Allen shoved Dorian Williams of Texas Tech after a dead ball whistled when Williams and Elijah Hawkins wrestled the ball away from Agbim and Williams stepped over Agbim in the aftermath. Three technical fouls were eventually called, two on Texas Tech and one on Wyoming. In the meantime, the Cowboys couldn't score from the floor and Texas Tech's defense took over. The Red Raiders wound up forcing 17 first-half turnovers and 25 for the game. Texas Tech scored 14 straight points, including seven by Toppin, to build a 32-13 advantage. The Red Raiders eventually led 46-20 at the break. Wyoming shot just 26.3 percent from the floor in the first half. In the second half, there was a moment of concern for Red Raiders fans as Toppin exited the game with 16:53 left and was checked by a trainer. He would later return.  Texas Tech continued to force more Wyoming mistakes and put on a show offensively with Hawkins feeding Federiko Federiko for multiple dunks. The lead was as big as 49. The storyline entering the contest was the Cowboys squaring off against former head coach Jeff Linder, who left the Wyoming program after four seasons in May to become the lead assistant at Texas Tech under Grant McCasland. In exchange for Linder, Texas Tech agreed to two games between the schools the next two years with Tech paying Wyoming $150,000 for each. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

After falling behind 90-68 late in the third quarter, New York -- playing the second leg of a back-to-back -- ended the period on a 17-0 run to set up an intense fourth quarter. There were 10 lead changes in the final period, the last coming on White's free throws on a tough foul call against Josh Hart. Jalen Brunson, who scored a pair of go-ahead baskets under duress in the final 38 seconds, created space for a fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, but his attempt rimmed in and out. Had the Knicks completed the comeback, it would have been the franchise's biggest second-half rally since a 26-point turnaround in March 2004. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 31 points and matched Brunson with a game-high eight assists. He also snagged seven rebounds. Karl-Anthony Towns scored 17 of his 46 points in the fourth quarter and hauled in 10 rebounds. Towns' scoring performance was a personal best since joining the Knicks in an offseason trade. Brunson and Towns combined to score 10 of New York's final 12 points. White, meanwhile, was clutch for Chicago. His 3-pointer on one of Ayo Dosunmu's six assists to answer a hard-charging Towns bucket gave the Bulls a four-point cushion in the final two minutes. Dosunmu was one of five Bulls to score in double-figures, shooting 5-of-8 from the floor en route to 16 points.

Guards AJ Hoggard (nine points, six assists, four steals), Tyler Tanner (14 points, three steals) and Grant Huffman (six points, six assists, five rebounds four steals) led the way on defense for the Commodores. Jason Edwards led Vanderbilt (3-0) with 18 points, and Devin McGlockton added 16 points and three blocks. Cal (2-1) got double-figure scoring from Andrej Stojakovic (17), BJ Omot (15), DJ Campbell (12) and Jovan Blacksher Jr. (11). The Bears' Lee Dort, who spent the last two seasons at Vanderbilt, had a game-high 10 rebounds but scored just four points. Cal turned the ball over just 21 times combined in their two games this year. Five of their giveaways on Wednesday came from Blacksher. Hoggard and McGlockton picked up their fourth fouls with 7:37 and 6:03 remaining, respectively, but the Commodores' deep bench (nine played logged at least 15 minutes) helped prevent a serious Cal run late in the game. Vanderbilt went up 21 after an Edwards 3-pointer to start the second half, but the Bears, behind a scoring flurry from Stojakovic, cut the deficit to 61-52 on Omot's jumper with 12:39 left. The Commodores then cranked up the defensive heat again, with steals from Chris Manon and MJ Collins Jr. leading to back-to-back, fastbreak layups from Collins and Tanner. Cal was never able to make a sustained push from there and a corner 3-pointer from Edwards with 4:56 left pushed the margin 83-63. Vanderbilt shot 19-for-23 on 2-point attempts while building a 49-31 halftime edge. The Commodores forced 12 turnovers that turned into 20 points while holding Cal's leading scorer, Blacksher (17.5-point average coming in) to two first-half points. Blacksher also committed three turnovers before the break. Cal coach Mark Madsen was absent to be with his family following the birth of a child this week. Associate head coach Adam Mazarei, a Vanderbilt assistant from 2019-23, led the team in his absence. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Five nights after needing overtime to earn a four-point win on their homecourt, the Celtics rallied from an early 13-point deficit. Boston beat the Nets for the sixth straight time and for the 12th time in the past 13 meetings. Coming off a 5-of-16 showing in Tuesday's one-point home loss to the Atlanta Hawks, Tatum made 12 of 19 of shots, handed out 10 of Boston's season-best 35 assists and collected nine rebounds. Jaylen Brown added 24 points and 12 rebounds as the Celtics delighted many of their fans in the crowd by shooting a season-best 53.8 percent. Payton Pritchard contributed 23, Jrue Holiday chipped in 16 and Sam Hauser finished with 12 as the trio combined to hit 11 of Boston's 22 3s. Ziare Williams scored 23 points and started for the second straight game for Dorian Finney-Smith (sprained left ankle) but the Nets could not keep pace with Boston's offense and lost for the third time in four games. Brooklyn also played without Ben Simmons (left calf tightness). Cam Thomas added 17 and Dennis Schroder contributed 16 as the Nets shot 50.6 percent and took their most lopsided loss of the season. Cameron Johnson's 3-pointer opened a 26-13 lead for the Nets with 3:52 remaining, but the Celtics ended the opening period with a 19-8 run wherein Tatum scored nine of their final 12 points of the quarter to slice the deficit to 34-32. The Celtics took their first lead when Hauser's 3 made it 37-36 early in the second, and they held a 65-60 edge at halftime. Boston began pulling away with about eight minutes left in the third when Tatum's open 3 pushed the lead to 80-68. Holiday's 3 extended the lead to 85-70 with 7:17 left and two hoops by Tatum in the final two minutes helped Boston take a 103-89 edge into the fourth. Tatum finished off his big night by hitting three free throws with 5:21 left for a 123-101 lead and then hit a 17-footer a few minutes later to a loud ovation. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Paul, a 27-year-old YouTube star turned professional boxer, has risen quickly in his quest for mainstream boxing credibility. In July, he knocked out Mike Perry, a veteran of UFC and Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, to earn his fourth consecutive win and improve to 10-1 with seven KOs. Opposite Paul is the former undisputed heavyweight champion Tyson, 58. The fight is Tyson's first sanctioned professional boxing match since losing to Kevin McBride in June 2005. Tyson retired shortly after that. His most recent bout was an exhibition bout against Roy Jones Jr. in November 2020. Tyson (50-6, 44 KOs) was a man of few words on Wednesday night, responding to critics who are predicting he's too old to compete at the highest level and confirming he is only focused on the fight against Paul and nothing past that. ""I'm just ready to fight,"" Tyson said. He remained stoic throughout the event, answering only the questions assigned to him and letting Paul make bold predictions about how the fight might play out. Paul asked nine of the 12 fighters on stage for Wednesday's event to honor a spontaneous bet if he lost to Tyson. Bets included putting fight purses at stake and as little as $20. When asked whether he would fight actual boxers (omitting Tyson), Paul brushed off the question but said his goal remains becoming the biggest superstar the sport has ever seen. ""Just excitement,"" Paul said. ""Excitement. Big fights, big knockouts. A lot of fighters go in (the ring) and have boring (expletive) fights like Floyd Mayweather (Jr.), and I've brought in a lot of excitement to the sport, knocking people out in the biggest platforms possible going against the biggest names and making the matchups fans want to see."" Tyson said he doesn't believe in the circus aspect of the fight, treating Paul like any other boxer. ""The people speak for themselves,"" Tyson said when addressing the plethora of champions on stage with him. Paul vs. Tyson was initially scheduled for July 20 before Tyson's ulcer flare-up in late May forced a postponement. The fight will take place at AT&T Stadium, home to the NFL's Dallas Cowboys. According to moderator and MMA journalist Ariel Helwani, 70,000 fans are expected to attend with a limited ticket inventory still available. The main card begins at 8 p.m. ET and includes four fights. The co-feature is a rematch over two years in the making, featuring Katie Taylor of Ireland against Amanda Serrano of Puerto Rico for the undisputed super lightweight world title. Taylor won the first bout by split decision after 10 rounds to keep her lightweight crown on May 1, 2022, at New York's Madison Square Garden. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Mitchell finished with 23 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists for Cleveland (13-0), which is off to the NBA's best start since the Golden State Warriors' record-setting 24-game winning streak to begin the 2015-16 season. The Cavaliers scuffled through much of the first half in this one before making a variety of big shots when it mattered most. Philadelphia fought hard without Joel Embiid (knee), Paul George (knee) and Tyrese Maxey (hamstring) but still lost for the ninth time in 11 games this season. The 76ers were playing on back-to-back nights, having lost to the New York Knicks on Tuesday. Rookie Jared McCain took advantage of the available playing time by scoring a career-high 34 points, while Kelly Oubre Jr. had 20 and Caleb Martin chipped in 18. With Cleveland clinging to a 103-100 lead with under three minutes to play, Mitchell drained 3-pointers on consecutive possessions to put the Cavaliers ahead 109-102. He added a step-back 3-pointer with 1:18 remaining and then drove for a layup to make it 114-104 with about a minute left. Both teams made five 3-pointers in the first quarter -- the Cavs needed only eight attempts to do so -- as Cleveland led 31-27 after one period. The Sixers began the second quarter with a 12-1 run. Reggie Jackson scored eight of those points for the hosts, while Martin had the other four. Philadelphia led by as many as eight points in the second quarter and held a 54-48 lead going into the locker room. Early in the third quarter, Cleveland scored 10 straight points, punctuated by Garland's floater, to turn a seven-point deficit into a 62-59 lead. Garland scored 13 third-quarter points for the visitors, who led 82-78 after three periods. Mitchell found Ty Jerome for a 3-pointer on the first possession of the fourth quarter and then drained a jumper on the next trip to grow Cleveland's cushion to 87-78. Philadelphia chipped away, however, closing within 95-93 on Oubre's layup with 6:47 to play. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

Thompson is averaging 16.5 points per game in Oklahoma State's 2-0 start while shooting 56.5 percent, meaning he is scoring more efficiently. He averaged 11.8 and 11.6 points per game in the last couple of seasons but failed to make 40 percent of his attempts in either campaign.

SIU (1-1) is coming off an 86-64 verdict Friday night against Division II Missouri S&T, the first win for new coach Scott Nagy. He's won 578 games in a 30-year career spent at South Dakota State and Wright State until he replaced Bryan Mullins in March.

Metcalf hopes to return to action when Seattle (4-5) visits the San Francisco 49ers (5-4) on Sunday. He sustained a Grade 1 MCL sprain in the Seahawks' 34-14 road victory against the Falcons. Seattle then lost home games to the Buffalo Bills and the Los Angeles Rams before a bye in Week 10. Metcalf has 35 receptions on 61 targets for 568 yards and three touchdowns in seven games (six starts) this season. Seattle selected him in the second round of the 2019 NFL Draft out of Ole Miss. A two-time Pro Bowl selection, Metcalf has 407 receptions for 5,900 yards and 46 touchdowns in 89 regular-season games (87 starts). He also has 26 receptions for 451 yards and five TDs in four playoff games, all starts. The Seahawks activated right tackle Abraham Lucas off the physically unable to perform list on Wednesday, at the end of his 21-day practice window. If Lucas had not been activated, he would have stayed on the PUP list for the remainder of the season. Lucas, 26, was a third-round pick of the Seahawks in 2022. He started all 22 games he played in 2022 and 2023 but was limited to six games last season because of a knee injury that required surgery, putting him on the PUP list. To make room for Lucas on the 53-man roster, Seattle placed offensive tackle George Fant on injured reserve that will require he miss at least four games. Fant, 32, played two games, both starts, this season before leaving each contest with a knee injury. Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said he was uncertain if Fant would be able to play again this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

The Seahawks shot a dreadful 29.1 percent overall (16 of 55), went 5-of-24 from 3-point range and committed 16 turnovers in their second loss to a ranked team this season. Wagner committed 10 fouls in the first 10:02 minutes of the game, but St. John's only sank eight of its first 13 free throw attempts and held an 18-12 lead on two fouls shots by Simeon Wilcher.   The Seahawks trailed 20-18 after a 3-pointer by Ezquerra, but St. John's countered with a 10-2 run for a 30-20 lead after Wilcher's layup with 2:54 remaining in the first half.  Wagner trailed 31-22 at halftime but pulled within 33-30 on a jumper by Ja'Kair Sanchez that capped an 8-0 run with 14:57 left.   The Red Storm appeared to start pulling away after scoring five straight points, but the Seahawks still hung around and trailed 39-37 on a deep 3-pointer from Ezquerra with 10:54 left. St. John's finally broke away from there. Smith started the run with a triple at the 9:54 mark and another trey by Scott made it 54-37 with 6:38 remaining. Dunlap's 3-point play capped the run, and Scott added two more buckets during another 8-0 flurry that made it 65-40 with 1:50 to go. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-14

MLB News,Rays will play in Tampa in 2025,https://www.mlb.com/news/rays-2025-steinbrenner-field,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 22:07:00 GMT",,"Adam Berry TAMPA, Fla. -- The Rays have found a home for the 2025 regular season: George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa. With Tropicana Field significantly damaged by Hurricane Milton last month and not expected to be repaired until 2026, the Rays had to search for an interim home for next season. That led them to Steinbrenner Field, home of the Yankees in Spring Training and the Single-A Tampa Tarpons in the Florida State League. “We deeply appreciate that the Yankees have graciously allowed us to play at Steinbrenner Field for the 2025 season,” Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg said in a statement. “The hurricane damage to Tropicana Field has forced us to take some extraordinary steps, just as Hurricanes Helene and Milton have forced thousands of families and businesses in our community to adapt to new circumstances as we all recover and rebuild.’’ The Rays will remain at their Charlotte Sports Park facility in Port Charlotte, Fla., for their Spring Training workouts and home games. The Yankees will continue to play their Spring Training games at Steinbrenner Field in 2025 before their American League East rivals move in for the regular season, and the Tarpons are expected to play elsewhere within the Yankees’ Minor League complex. The Rays are set to begin the season at home against the Rockies on March 27. By that point, they will have moved into the home clubhouse at Steinbrenner Field and done what they can to make the Yankees’ facility look as much like a Tampa Bay home ballpark as possible. We are thrilled to play in Tampa Bay. 🩵 “We are happy to extend our hand to the Rays and their fans by providing a Major League-quality facility for them to utilize this season,’’ Yankees managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner said in a statement. “Both the Yankees organization and my family have deep roots in the Tampa Bay region, and we understand how meaningful it is for Rays players, employees and fans to have their 2025 home games take place within 30 minutes of Tropicana Field. In times like these, rivalry and competition take a back seat to doing what’s right for our community — which is continuing to help families and businesses rebound from the devastation caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton.” Commissioner Rob Manfred said recently that MLB hoped to keep the Rays close to their fans in the Tampa Bay area, which this move will accomplish. In a press release announcing the decision, the Rays said they selected Steinbrenner Field “because it is the best-prepared facility in the Tampa Bay region to host regular-season Major League Baseball games.” “Given the significant challenges caused by Hurricane Milton, I appreciate the hard work and collaboration between the two teams that allowed the Rays to make the best decision for next season,"" Manfred said in a statement. ""This outcome meets Major League Baseball’s goals that Rays’ fans will see their team play next season in their home market and that their players can remain home without disruption to their families.” Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Indeed, Rays president Matt Silverman said the club wanted to stay in the area to provide their fans, employees, players and coaches with “as much normalcy as possible, given the disruption that’s taken place at Tropicana Field.” Spending the season in Tampa will allow that. The Rays considered other nearby Spring Training ballparks, including BayCare Ballpark in Clearwater and TD Ballpark in Dunedin, but Steinbrenner Field ultimately offered the best available facilities. That was of the utmost importance considering the limited time between the Trop being damaged and the start of Spring Training. Steinbrenner Field also has the largest capacity of any Spring Training stadium in the Tampa Bay area, at 11,026, plus 13 luxury suites. The Rays said they expect additional improvements to be made before the season begins “to ensure fans continue to have a wonderful experience at Rays games.” According to the Rays, Steinbrenner Field was in the process of being renovated to improve its clubhouse and playing facilities. Other recent upgrades to the ballpark include upgraded field lighting, expanded home clubhouse space and improved training and rehabilitation capabilities. Silverman said the Rays are working with MLB and the MLB Players Association to understand what further upgrades must be made to get the ballpark ready for a big league season. While the home clubhouse has been renovated, the visiting side will likely require additions, expansion and MLB-caliber amenities. “The amount of work that's going to be required by a combination of the Yankees and Rays organizations to get the facility ready for March is incredible, and time is of the essence. The Yankees have been great partners,” Silverman said. “They've been incredibly responsive. They've been so gracious with their time, with their facility, and I know that together, we're going to be able to pull off what is a very challenging feat in just a couple of months.” Steinbrenner Field opened in 1996, when it was known as Legends Field. The ballpark is centrally located in Tampa, sitting just across Dale Mabry Highway from Raymond James Stadium, home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The playing field’s dimensions are somewhat similar to Tropicana Field (and identical to Yankee Stadium in the Bronx), going 318 feet out to left field (315 at Tropicana Field), 408 to center (404 at the Trop) and 314 to right (322 at the Trop). One challenge will be the hot, rainy and humid Florida weather in the summer, which often leads to rain delays in the Florida State League and forces teams to shift their pregame work inside. Welcome to the neighborhood, @RaysBaseball. The Krewe is with you through this transition. pic.twitter.com/Ncof4Q8A0T The Rays hope to be back inside Tropicana Field in 2026, assuming St. Petersburg moves forward with the necessary repairs to the city-owned stadium. Earlier this year, the St. Petersburg City Council and Pinellas County Commission approved their plans to build a new, $1.3 billion ballpark that would open in 2028 as part of the Historic Gas Plant District in St. Pete.

MLB News,Here are 7 Hot Takes for a sizzling offseason,https://www.mlb.com/news/bold-predictions-for-mlb-offseason-2024-2025,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 03:49:56 GMT",,"Anthony Castrovince This is the time of year when anything appears possible. Even more than Opening Day, when hope springs eternal for all 30 clubs, the onset of the offseason is fascinating because it’s still so unclear what the final rosters will look like. It’s the time of year when, for instance, you can come across a headline like, “Rays reach out to Juan Soto,” because, hey, it’s an open market, isn’t it? • Latest free agent and trade rumors The Hot Stove, therefore, is the perfect time for Hot Takes. So here are a handful of thoughts I’ve had while wondering if Jose Siri will give up his No. 22 jersey to Soto. 1. The Yankees might be better off without Juan Soto. Everything I think about the Yankees’ offseason boils down to this: Aaron Judge should not be in center field. I’m not saying that because Judge biffed a big ball in Game 5 of the World Series; I’m saying that because there’s no reason for a team with the Yankees’ resources to have a player that old (Judge will be 33 next season), that big and that important in such a demanding defensive position. In the last 15 years, there have only been seven players -- Brett Gardner, Curtis Granderson, Torii Hunter, Coco Crisp, Denard Span, Lorenzo Cain and Angel Pagán -- to have a season in which they qualified for the batting title in center field at the age of 33 or older. And none of them was 6-foot-7, 280 pounds. Having Giancarlo Stanton at DH limits the Yankees’ options with Judge. And if they’re not going deep, deep, deep into luxury tax territory, then re-signing Soto reduces their flexibility and their ability to get more athletic elsewhere. Just spitballing here, but what if, instead of Judge in center and Soto in right, you could have Judge in right, Jazz Chisholm Jr. in center, Alex Bregman at third base, Willy Adames at second base and Christian Walker at first base? According to MLB Trade Rumors’ projections, you could sign Bregman, Adames and Walker for a long-term total of about $400 million, versus the $600 million it might take to keep Soto. And you would have a team that is deeper and more defensively dependable, albeit without a Gehrig to Judge’s Ruth. 2. The Diamondbacks should keep Jordan Montgomery. So … this is awkward. When Montgomery went unsigned last winter despite coming off his best season, the D-backs scooped him up late in Spring Training on a one-year, $25 million deal with a $22.5 million player option for 2024. It was a disaster. The late start did Montgomery no favors, and he never got into a groove. He pitched so poorly (6.23 ERA) that when the season ended Arizona owner Ken Kendrick publicly stated that he regretted the signing and took responsibility for having pushed for it. Montgomery exercised the player option anyway, because, well, it’s $22.5 million. You’d do the same. And that has led to speculation that the D-backs might now deal Montgomery to divorce themselves from this sticky situation. But even though the Snakes seemingly have a starting pitching surplus at the moment, that’s only true until it’s not. Selling low on Montgomery is senseless. Rather, I’d embrace the awkwardness with Montgomery, because, when you look at his career, 2024 is a clear outlier. The two sides would be better off pursuing ways they can make each other better and salvage what’s left of this deal. And to the D-backs’ credit, GM Mike Hazen has already been working to smooth things over. 3. The A’s should trade Brent Rooker. A’s general manager David Forst said, “We are not trading Brent Rooker,” which sure makes it sound as though they are not trading Brent Rooker. But I don’t get it. Keeping the 26-year-old Mason Miller after his transcendent rookie season is one thing, given the long-term cost control involved. But Rooker is arbitration-eligible for the first time this winter and will play next season at age 30. He is an extraordinarily valuable trade chip in a market in which only one team can land Soto. His 165 OPS+ this season was the 16th-best ever for a qualified DH. His trade value will likely never be higher than it is right now. And while the A’s did play .500 ball in the second half, they just aren’t in a competitive enough position to be punting on opportunities to improve their long-term organizational outlook. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. 4. The NL East team that needs Pete Alonso most is not the Mets. There seems to be this theory that Alonso is worth more to the Mets than any other team. Because of the prodigious power he’s brought to their lineup since 2019. Because of his popularity. Because he hit that season-saving blast off the Brewers’ Devin Williams in the NL Wild Card Series. But it should be obvious that, for the Mets, signing the 26-year-old Soto should take precedence over re-upping with Alonso. They can do both, of course, but having Soto, Alonso, Francisco Lindor and Brandon Nimmo all inked for $20 million-plus through at least 2030 has the potential to hamstring the Mets down the road. And with or without Soto, there is an argument to be made for a (likely) more budget-friendly move for Walker or moving Mark Vientos to first base and improving defensively at the hot corner. The team that actually needs Alonso most is the Nationals. Coming off five straight seasons with a sub-.440 winning percentage, they are at a pivotal point in player development where it’s time to start creating a winning culture. They’ve got good young starting pitching, and they graduated intriguing outfield prospects Dylan Crews and James Wood to the big leagues this year. Still, they could use a proven centerpiece like Alonso, who would bring instant credibility to a lineup that was last in the NL in homers last season and got a lowly .686 OPS from first base. 5. No team should be more aggressive than the Orioles. The above is not meant to suggest that the O’s should be this offseason’s biggest spender. I’d venture to guess that title will go to whichever team signs Soto (duh). That won’t be Baltimore. But after their second consecutive empty October, the O’s have to raise the organizational stakes again. They made the big trade last offseason for Corbin Burnes and do deserve some credit for getting some big production out of Zach Eflin in a midseason trade market that was seriously short on starting pitching. That said, no team was in better position to make the Tigers an offer they couldn’t refuse on Tarik Skubal, and that particular ship has sailed now that the Tigers proved themselves as contenders. So it's on the O’s to go elsewhere for their clear pitching needs, which only become more pressing with Burnes on the open market. They can let Burnes and his declining K rate walk, recoup Draft pick compensation and still find a way to improve the rotation. With new ownership and a still-stocked system, they have the ability to, say, sign Blake Snell and trade for Garrett Crochet. We dream big with Baltimore because of the upside and cost control of their young core. But that core will get a lot more expensive (and therefore more complicated) in the not-too-distant future, so it is incumbent upon the O’s now to make sure this championship window is not wasted. 6. Walker Buehler will be the best starter signed this winter. I’m what the kids call a Walker Buehler “stan.” I love the guy. He’s got stuff, but he’s also got guts. This is a team for which the likes of Max Scherzer and Tyler Glasnow have been unable to post in pivotal moments in recent years. But Buehler takes the ball. He did it on short rest in Game 6 of the 2021 NLCS when Scherzer had a dead arm (that may have had an impact on Buehler’s elbow, which required Tommy John the following year). Buehler returned this year and again stepped up in the World Series, making it clear he was available to pitch in relief prior to Game 5 and then doing so with a perfect ninth just two days after starting Game 3. Buehler had an uninspiring regular season, but he learned to pitch in this postseason without the same fastball that used to bully batters. The Dodgers did him a favor in not making the qualifying offer, though they might re-sign him, anyway. He’s not among the very top free agents in a deep starter’s market, but it says here that whoever lands Buehler will get a gamer who learned a lot about himself in 2024 and will provide the best value on the board. 7. Roki Sasaki should sign with my favorite team. Not the Dodgers. That’s not fair! • Japanese ace Sasaki coming to MLB next season",2024-11-14
MLB News,Soto ... and then? MLB execs pick No. 2 free agent,https://www.mlb.com/news/which-mlb-free-agent-ranks-closest-to-juan-soto,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 01:36:00 GMT",,"Mark Feinsand As Juan Soto begins to meet with suitors in the coming days, there are several free agents who will be watching that situation closely. Such sluggers as Pete Alonso and Anthony Santander will be intrigued to see which clubs strike out on Soto, potentially opening the door for them to be the power bats those clubs need. Ditto for Willy Adames and Alex Bregman, who might not have the same pop as the aforementioned duo but offer more well-rounded skill sets at important defensive positions. Top pitchers, including Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried, also will be interested parties, as the clubs that are unable to sign Soto will have significant dollars left to spend. So while the consensus is that Soto is the top free agent on the market this offseason, which player is the next-best option for clubs seeking a major free-agent upgrade? We posed that question to a number of executives around the league, asking them which player they consider to be No. 2 in the current free-agent class. Note: We eliminated Roki Sasaki from this exercise, as the Japanese starting pitcher is considered an international amateur free agent, which will prevent him from landing a nine-figure contract, a factor that would almost certainly make him the consensus answer -- if not move him ahead of Soto for the No. 1 spot. Who's the second-best free agent in this class, behind Soto?• Corbin Burnes (eight votes)• Willy Adames (five votes)• Blake Snell (two votes)• Max Fried (one vote) Burnes’ place atop the poll demonstrates the clear value of starting pitching around the Majors. “I think it’s so incredibly difficult to get your hands on a frontline starter who has the ability to strike out hitters, keep walks down and who is built to pitch innings,” a National League executive said. “He’s a horse, and he’ll pitch at just 30 years old. So, theoretically, there should be a number of good years ahead of him. “Those guys are really hard to come by -- particularly in today’s game. His ability to eat innings is incredibly valuable.” Burnes’ 816 2/3 innings since the start of the 2020 season rank third in the Majors, behind Zack Wheeler and Aaron Nola, both of whom signed nine-figure contracts in the past year. During the past five seasons, Burnes has a 2.88 ERA and 1.02 WHIP, firmly establishing himself as one of the top starters in the game. “He’s the best starting pitcher out there, with both past success and age on his side,” an NL executive said. “All of the other position players have at least some question marks, so none of them rise up to No. 2.” If there is one concern about Burnes, it’s that his strikeout rate has dropped every year since 2020, when he registered a career-best mark of 36.7%. Last season, Burnes fanned 181 batters in 194 1/3 innings. His 23.1% rate marked his lowest since his 2018 rookie season (23.0%). “I think Burnes is probably next, but the recent results have been very good, not quite great,” an American League executive said. “I still trust him more than Fried or Snell, but all those guys are reasonably close.” Another NL executive cited the strikeout numbers as one reason he chose Snell as his No. 2 behind Soto, though Snell’s lack of draft-pick compensation also helps his case. “Snell positioned himself nicely to land the payday he sought last offseason,” the NL exec said. “Burnes’ declining strikeout rate could make Snell the preferred choice between those two for many clubs.” Snell’s second half (1.45 ERA over 68 1/3 innings in 12 starts) was stellar, though his first half -- marked by injury and inconsistency -- might cause some clubs some concern. Snell falls short of Burnes when it comes to durability, having thrown more than 130 innings only twice in his career. “Burnes has a rare combo in today’s game of durability and impact,” an AL executive said. When Snell is on top of his game, there aren’t many pitchers who perform better. And you can look no further than his two Cy Young Awards as proof. But those are in the past. And as he enters his age-32 season, there appears to be more risk with signing him to a long-term deal than there is with Burnes. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. “Snell can be great; we all know that,” an NL executive said. “But the old saying, ‘The best ability is availability’ is a cliché for a reason. Snell just isn’t always available. And if you’re paying a pitcher $30 million a year, you want to feel confident that he’s going to take the ball 30-plus times every year. That’s why I would go with Burnes.” While 11 of the 16 voters chose a starting pitcher, the five who went with a position player were unanimous in their selection: Adames. The 29-year-old easily tops the list of available shortstops this offseason, a position valued as much for defense as offense. Adames didn’t have a standout season defensively in 2024, but his 26 outs above average since the start of 2022 rank fourth in the Majors among shortstops. “Because of the position he plays and because there are teams that need a shortstop, he’s really valuable,” an AL executive said. “When he played against us, all I could think was, ‘I’d love to have that guy on our team.’” Adames recorded career highs in home runs (32) and RBIs (112) this past season for the Brewers, finishing the year with a personal-best 4.8 fWAR. He has been at least a three-win player in all five of his full seasons in the Majors, playing at least 139 games in each of them. Bregman didn’t receive any votes. Two executives noted that while his career statistics are better than Adames, there has been some offensive decline in recent years. After finishing second in AL MVP voting in 2019 with 41 home runs, 112 RBIs and a 1.015 OPS, Bregman hasn’t come close to those numbers again. He posted a career-low .768 OPS in 2024, with 26 homers and 75 RBIs. “I think they’re very similar today,” an AL executive said. “I’ll take the guy who is 1 1/2 years younger and has played shortstop recently.” Two executives also cited Adames’ reputation as a clubhouse leader, noting that he brings as much to a team off the field as he does between the lines. “He’s so good, and he’s such a good human,” an AL executive said. “If you’re throwing money at someone and you’re going to invest in them, you’re going to get a lot of benefits from him. He plays; he posts every day, and durability is something we don’t always pay for.” Added another AL executive: “Everything I've been told about him, he’s a wonderful teammate who connects with the American players and Latin American players. You put all those things together with what he can do on the field, he’s going to be attractive to a lot of teams. With long-term deals for big money, that’s got to factor in.”",2024-11-14
MLB News,Could this be the deciding factor in the Sasaki sweepstakes?,https://www.mlb.com/news/roki-sasaki-rumors,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 22:40:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Roki Sasaki. Nov. 14: Could this be the deciding factor in the Sasaki sweepstakes?The Dodgers are viewed as one of the top contenders to sign Sasaki once he is posted by his Nippon Professional Baseball team, the Chiba Lotte Marines. However, The Athletic's Jim Bowden (subscription required) doesn't see it that way. Based on his conversations with league sources, Bowden thinks it's ""unlikely"" Sasaki will sign with the Dodgers. And Bowden mentioned a few reasons why. The main one has to do with money. Since Sasaki is younger than 25 years old and hasn't reached six years of service in a foreign major league, he is subject to MLB's international amateur signing bonus pool rules. He won't get anything close to the $325 million contract that Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto received last offseason. Instead, Sasaki's contract value will be limited to what a team has in its bonus pool. That could be somewhere in the neighborhood of $7 million if Sasaki waits to sign until after Jan. 15, when each team's bonus pool will be refilled for the start of the 2025 international signing period. So, how can Sasaki make more money outside of his contract? Bowden says the answer is simple: endorsements. But therein lies the possible issue with a Sasaki-Dodgers match. ""In Los Angeles, [Sasaki would] be in the shadow of both [Shohei] Ohtani and Yamamoto, which would lessen his endorsement ceiling,"" Bowden wrote. Conversely, if Sasaki signs with a team such as the Padres, not only would he share a clubhouse with his idol, Yu Darvish, the 23-year-old ""could potentially maximize his endorsements in Japan, positioning himself as a rival to the Dodgers’ Ohtani and Yamamoto rather than a teammate of theirs."" Furthermore, a massive contingent of Japanese media cover the Dodgers on a daily basis, and, per Bowden, ""that level of attention is not the best situation for a young, developing pitcher."" The Dodgers are known for being fantastic with how they develop young pitchers. But Bowden points out that teams such as the Padres, Rays, Mets and Braves also have strong pitching development programs, thereby possibly negating any advantage L.A. might have there. ""Based on what I’m hearing,"" Bowden wrote, ""I think the Padres, Rays, Mets and Braves are all more likely to sign Sasaki than the Dodgers -- and several other teams will be in the mix."" Nov. 9: Do the Padres have an edge in the Sasaki sweepstakes?MLB.com's Mark Feinsand lists several favorites to land Sasaki, including the Giants, Yankees, Mets, Blue Jays, Cubs and Rangers. But he writes that the two most likely landing spots, at least according to one NL executive, would be the Dodgers and Padres. An article in The Athletic (subscription required) adds the Phillies as a team to watch and also suggests that the Padres may have an advantage by way of one of their current starters. ""In the case of the Padres, Sasaki is believed to be like many other Japanese pitchers who hold a deep admiration for Yu Darvish,"" the report states. That, coupled with Sasaki's reported preference for West Coast teams, could make the Padres a ""favorite among favorites,"" so to speak. Nov. 9: Sasaki to be posted by Chiba Lotte MarinesSasaki appears headed to the Majors next season. Sasaki, the consensus top young pitcher in Japan, will be posted by the Chiba Lotte Marines of the Nippon Professional Baseball, the team announced. Sasaki, 23, should inspire an all-out pursuit reminiscent of Shohei Ohtani’s initial contract with the Angels, in league-wide interest and financial scope. Ohtani agreed to a $2.315 million signing bonus with the Angels in December 2017. An unfettered market would have yielded a much larger contract, but foreign-born players are subject to international bonus pool money restrictions unless they are at least 25 years of age and have played as a professional in a foreign league recognized by Major League Baseball for a minimum of six seasons. Ohtani was not yet 25 years old when he was posted by the Nippon Ham Fighters, so the Collective Bargaining Agreement classified him as an international amateur. Sasaki falls into the same category now. More >",2024-11-14
MLB News,Where the Blue Jays stand in the Soto sweepstakes,https://www.mlb.com/news/blue-jays-chances-to-sign-juan-soto,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 16:39:32 GMT",,"Keegan Matheson This story was excerpted from Keegan Matheson’s Blue Jays Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. TORONTO -- Oh, yes, we’re doing this again. It’s Juan Soto season in Major League Baseball and the Blue Jays want to dance. Of course they do. It’s Juan Soto. The great heartbreak of Shohei Ohtani an offseason ago has left so many Blue Jays fans hesitant to lean into the madness again -- understandably so -- but the Blue Jays are on the short list of teams with the ownership buy-in and recent spending habits to put them in conversations for players of this caliber. They’re not the old Blue Jays anymore, a big-market team pretending to be from a small town. Having a dollar and spending a dollar are two very different things, though. With ESPN’s Jeff Passan reporting that the Blue Jays will meet with Soto this week, there’s clear interest, but this isn’t about which organization likes Soto the most … It’s about which organization is most willing to do something about it. While many in the industry still view Soto’s free agency as the battle of New York between the Mets and Yankees, there is still an opening for anyone else to step in and make an impression. The head vs. the heartIf the Blue Jays ever get down the road with Soto and generate a level of genuine interest from the young star and his agent, Scott Boras, this is what it will all come down to. Modern front offices are a beehive on information and projections. A good front office doesn’t marry itself to those numbers, though, and knows when to let the reality of their circumstances have a seat at the table. At some point in the Soto negotiations, one team will need to break from their projections and make an emotional decision to say: “Whatever. We want this guy.” That hasn’t always been the Blue Jays’ way of doing business. For nearly the past decade, we’ve seen this front office spend freely and bring in Hyun Jin Ryu, George Springer, Kevin Gausman and Chris Bassitt while also extending José Berríos. Toronto’s big swings have, for the most part, played out well. The Blue Jays lean heavily on their own valuations of players, though -- the result of a thousand meetings that are surely happening while you’re reading this -- and Soto is a player who transcends any typical free-agent approach. The Blue Jays wouldn’t be up against the money of the Mets or the money of the Yankees, they’d be up against more human forces. The pride of the Yankees, who just fell short in the World Series and know they can’t take a step backwards, will likely push them beyond their comfort zone. The aggression of Mets owner Steven Cohen, who has already spent an incredible amount on that roster, could be on full display. It’s New York versus New York, ego versus ego as much as dollar versus dollar. Are the Blue Jays really going to be the team that, in the home stretch of these negotiations, chooses to break away from the pack? Will the disappointment of eight seasons without a postseason win be enough to force this front office to break away from what we’ve seen and do something bolder? What it would look likeWe just saw what it looked like with Soto batting in front of Aaron Judge. Imagine the same with Vladimir Guerrero Jr. It’s a terrifying thought for pitchers. The baseball side is obvious. Soto is on a Hall of Fame track, a truly elite hitter who has looked just as dominant in the postseason. He would instantly -- all by himself -- turn the Blue Jays into a legitimate contender in 2025, but any conversation involving Soto requires a broader view of what this would mean to the organization. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. As it stands today, the Blue Jays have an off-ramp available to them after 2025 and an even clearer one after 2026. With Guerrero and Bo Bichette due to hit free agency after this coming season and others the year after, including Gausman and potentially Berrios (opt-out), there’s a world in which the Blue Jays take a step back and retool if things don’t go well. Landing Soto -- or, much more realistically, extending Guerrero -- suddenly flings that window back open. If the Blue Jays spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a superstar, that represents a commitment to spending similar dollars or even more in the years to come. It would be a fresh start of sorts, or a reset, for the entire franchise.",2024-11-14
MLB News,Dave Sims will follow Sterling as Yanks radio voice,https://www.mlb.com/news/dave-sims-john-sterling-yankees-radio-play-by-play,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 23:51:00 GMT",,"Bryan Hoch NEW YORK – Dave Sims stood in front of the visiting dugout at Seattle’s T-Mobile Park two months ago, watching the Yankees take batting practice ahead of a game against the Mariners. His career has been built upon the delivery of words, but at this moment, the veteran broadcaster felt it wasn’t appropriate to say much. Yes, he acknowledged that he’d heard the rumors mentioning his name in recent weeks, and sure, he would be interested in the Yankees radio play-by-play position if it were offered to him. Then there was this: while Sims loves Seattle, as he repeated several times, New York would always represent home. A post shared by Dave Sims (@tdss) Now Sims is on his way back. He has a multiyear agreement to become WFAN’s new play-by-play broadcaster for Yankees games, replacing John Sterling, who retired early in 2024 before returning for the playoffs, the team announced on Thursday. A Philadelphia native, the 71-year-old Sims has been one of the Mariners’ primary television voices since 2007. He is familiar to sports fans for calling Major League Baseball and college basketball games on ESPN, as well as NCAA basketball and NFL play-by-play on Westwood One. “THE DREAM LIVES!

MLB News,Red Sox sign veteran lefty reliever Justin Wilson to 1-year deal,https://www.mlb.com/news/justin-wilson-red-sox-deal,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 21:12:00 GMT",,"Ian Browne BOSTON – While the Red Sox woo free agent Juan Soto and pursue a trade for White Sox ace Garrett Crochet, they were able to make a complementary move on Thursday by finalizing a one-year contract with lefty reliever Justin Wilson. The veteran will earn $2.25 million, a source told MLB.com, but the club has not confirmed the value of the deal. Adding Wilson is the first step by chief baseball officer Craig Breslow in what is expected to be a significant revamping of the bullpen this winter. Closer Kenley Jansen and ace setup man Chris Martin are both free agents. Jansen isn’t in the club’s plans going forward, and it’s unclear whether the club will try to retain Martin. Boston struggled from the left side of the bullpen in ’24, but for next year, Wilson joins Brennan Bernardino as manager Alex Cora's options. Wilson pitched for the Reds last season, notching a 5.59 ERA in 60 outings. In 46 2/3 innings, Wilson gave up 55 hits and 13 walks while striking out 51. It was a comeback season for Wilson, who missed most of ’22 and all of ’23 following Tommy John surgery. Wilson fared better against righties (.754 OPS) than lefties (.919 OPS) last season. In his career, Wilson’s splits are fairly neutral, as he’s held lefties to a .251 average and .704 OPS and righties to a .220 average and .650 OPS. In a career that has also included stops in Pittsburgh, New York (Yankees and Mets), Detroit and Chicago (Cubs), the 37-year-old Wilson is 34-29 with a 3.61 ERA and 20 saves. All 587 of his appearances have been out of the bullpen. Per Statcast, Wilson’s best attribute in ’24 was inducing a 33.8 percent chase rate, which put him in the 95th percentile. The #RedSox today announced that they have added Chris Holt to the Major League coaching staff as Bullpen Coach. pic.twitter.com/tV7erIJDA1 In other news, the Red Sox announced the hiring of Chris Holt as their new bullpen coach. The 45-year-old, a native of Portland, Maine, spent the past five seasons as director of pitching for the Orioles. He was the club’s Major League pitching coach from 2021-23.",2024-11-14
MLB News,Report on Sasaki? 'Probably one of the greatest pitchers I’ve ever seen live',https://www.mlb.com/news/roki-sasaki-scouting-report,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 01:00:00 GMT",,"Jonathan Mayo Roki Sasaki burst onto the scene in Japan as a 19-year-old in 2021, posting a 1.84 ERA over 16 starts. He bounded onto the world stage when he joined a star-studded Japanese rotation that included Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto in the 2023 World Baseball Classic. Now it looks like he’ll get the chance to join them in the Major Leagues in 2025. While teams will try to position themselves to be the best suitor for the right-hander, Sasaki will not be making his choice solely based on up-front money. Like Ohtani in 2017, because he’s under 25, his signing is subject to international bonus pool rules and will count against a team’s international bonus pool. So all 30 teams are limited in what they can offer. Beyond the eye-popping numbers (2.02 ERA, 11.4 K/9, 2.0 BB/9, 6.0 H/9 over four seasons), what exactly will teams entering the Sasaki sweepstakes be vying for? Let’s take a deeper look: The scouting reportThe 6-foot-3 Sasaki will pitch all of the 2025 season at age 23 and is more than three years younger than Yamamoto, around the same age as Ohtani was when he made his big league debut. He’s been scouted continuously since he made his NPB debut in 2021 and especially since his World Baseball Classic coming-out party, with international scouting departments wanting to make sure they were ready when the right-hander was posted. “He’s as good as advertised,” one international scouting director said. “He has an ideal projectable, lean and athletic frame. He has excellent arm action and delivery, with three plus power pitches with control over command. He has No. 1 upside.” Throwing out that “No. 1” label is not something scouts do freely, but that director was not the only one to do so. “In my opinion, he’s a top-end starter,” another director said. “I wouldn’t say he’s Ohtani, but from a pitching standpoint, it’s very comparative. I’ve been seeing him since he was 19, and saw him on the national team. It’s an explosive arm.” “He reminds me of Noah Syndergaard when he was fresh,” a third international scout said. FastballIt’s at least a 70 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale, and depending on when you saw it, it might get the rarely spotted 80. It’s been up to 102 mph in the past and averaged 98.8 mph (96-100 more often than not) in '23 with some armside run. In 2024, it averaged 96.8 mph (95-99 most of the time). Some evaluators said it was a little straighter than the previous year, perhaps a reason why it missed fewer bats (13.1 percent whiff rate vs. 24.0 pct in '23), but as long as there are no lasting injury concerns, this isn’t too much of a worry. More on Sasaki: SplitterThis is the “national pitch” according to James Dykstra, a former White Sox draftee who had as good a view of it as anyone last year while pitching for the Chibo Latte Marines alongside Sasaki. Dykstra came out of the San Diego area high school powerhouse Rancho Bernardo High School and was drafted three times, eventually joining the White Sox as a sixth-rounder in 2013. He reached Triple-A and spent time in Mexico and indy ball before heading to Japan to pitch for the Marines this past season. Arriving in Japan armed with a splitter of his own, Dykstra couldn’t wait to see Sasaki’s up close after seeing how filthy it was during the World Baseball Classic. “I stood behind the catcher in his bullpen early in Spring Training and said ‘Oh my!’"" Dykstra said. “I knew how good it was in the World Baseball Classic and it even exceeded my expectations. It’s probably one of the best splitters I’ve ever seen.” The data backs up his eyewitness report. Throwing the pitch in the 88-90 mph range, Sasaki kills spin with it, and it comes out of his hand looking like his heater until it falls off the table. It produced an absurd 57.1 percent whiff rate in '24. The Major League average whiff rate on the splitter this past season was 34.5 percent. Sasaki would have placed second among all big league pitchers in this category with a minimum of 100 swings on splitters: Fernando Cruz (CIN): 59.3%Roki Sasaki (NPB): 57.1%Mark Leiter Jr. (NYY): 56.5%Justin Martinez (AZ): 54.0%Reed Garrett (NYM): 51.1% Dykstra had to hearken back to his days with Chicago to remember the last time he was so impressed with a secondary offering. “The only other time I’ve been in a bullpen and was mind-blown, I was with the White Sox and I watched a Chris Sale slider from behind the catcher,” he said. SliderThis is Sasaki’s “third” pitch but some scouts grade it out as above-average, if not plus. Even though it also was down a tick or two this past season, Sasaki still missed bats with it at a 40.7 percent rate, throwing it in the 83-85 mph range. In '23, his breaking ball elicited a whiff rate of 48.6 percent and was typically an upper-80s offering, more consistently getting plus grades.

Sasaki's 2024 metrics: Sasaki's 2023 metrics: ConclusionWhile teams may have questions about Sasaki’s small downtick in velocity, it certainly won’t keep any team from being interested. He is, after all, a starter who finished last season with a 2.35 ERA, 10.5 K/9 and 2.6 BB/9 rates at age 22. It’s agreed that once posted, Sasaki would become the top international prospect in his class, whether it’s '24 or 2025. As one scout pointed out, he’s much more of a sure thing compared to the teenagers currently on the 2025 Top 50 international prospects list, someone who will be expected to step into a big league rotation, if not lead it, on Opening Day 2025. How much would a pitcher like that warrant on an open market if he didn’t fall under the international bonus pool spending rules? “A lot,” one international scouting director said. That director declined to define “a lot,” but keeping Yamamoto’s 12-year, $325 million deal with the Dodgers in mind, another scouting executive tried to find some parameters. “I think it would be $275-300 million if he was in an open market, for 10 years -- that’s what I would think he’d get,” he said. “The sky is the limit for this guy.” Dykstra, for one, agrees. “It’s well known his talent is pretty much unmatched,” he said, adding that Sasaki was a tremendous teammate who worked hard on his English and his craft on the mound. ""I came back from watching that bullpen and said, 'this is probably one of the greatest pitchers I’ve ever seen live.' “Every time he pitched was more and more impressive. I can’t think of a single person that has this much raw talent.”",2024-11-14
MLB News,"The top 10 free-agent starters, ranked",https://www.mlb.com/news/free-agent-starting-pitcher-power-rankings-2024-2025,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 03:44:03 GMT",An offseason edition of Starting Pitcher Power Rankings,"Andrew Simon This is an opportune offseason to be in search of rotation help. Many of the most coveted free agents available are starting pitchers, and that group was bolstered further by the recent news that the top pitcher in Japan is going to be posted. But how exactly do all of these talented arms stack up? To answer that question, we turned to our MLB.com panel to vote on one final 2024 edition of the Starting Pitcher Power Rankings. This one focuses only on free agents. Here is a look at the results, with each pitcher listed alongside his final 2024 team. 1. Corbin Burnes, OriolesBurnes presents an interesting case. In the big picture, he has four straight All-Star selections and almost certainly is headed for a fifth straight top-10 Cy Young Award finish, including his win in 2021. The 30-year-old has thrown more than 190 innings with an ERA+ of better than 125 for three straight seasons. On the other hand, his strikeout and whiff rates have plummeted from their elite peaks in 2021-22. This past season, Burnes' 23.1% K rate was only 29th out of 58 qualified pitchers. That could give some teams cause for concern before handing out a long-term deal, but Burnes has been so effective that he still stands atop this class. 2. Roki Sasaki, Chiba Lotte Marines (NPB)Why will Sasaki be so hotly pursued by MLB teams once his posting window officially opens? Just imagine if someone like NL Rookie of the Year favorite Paul Skenes was suddenly made available to any bidder. Sasaki, who turned 23 on Nov. 3, is only seven months older than Skenes, and like the Pirates right-hander, has top-of-the-charts, power stuff. Like Shohei Ohtani in 2017, Sasaki is subject to international bonus pool money restrictions, which means that any team signing him will do so while making a relatively minimal financial commitment. There are certainly risks here, especially in terms of health and durability, but Sasaki’s potential is easily the highest of anyone available this offseason, other than Juan Soto. 3. Blake Snell, GiantsSnell’s first foray into free agency didn’t go as planned. Despite coming off his second Cy Young Award in 2023, the lefty languished on the market until mid-March before finally signing with the Giants on a one-year deal with a player option for 2025. Expect Snell to do better this time around after exercising his opt-out clause. While his late start this past season seemed to hinder him initially, Snell was virtually unhittable for the last three months of the season, posting a 1.23 ERA and 1.77 FIP across 14 starts, which included a no-hitter on Aug. 2 at Cincinnati. Opponents hit a meager .123/.211/.171 against him over that span. Snell is always going to face some questions about his durability and high walk rates, but at his best, he’s as dominant as anyone. 4. Max Fried, BravesHere’s a stat that might surprise you: Among the 67 pitchers who have thrown at least 500 innings over the past five seasons, Fried sports easily the best ERA+ (151), well ahead of Burnes and Zack Wheeler (141). Of course, Fried is only 25th in innings and 34th in strikeout rate among that group, which perhaps explains him ranking outside the top three on this list. Fried has never blown away hitters with velocity or missed a ton of bats, but when it comes to keeping runs off the board, he has been consistently excellent. How? He avoids hard contact as well as anyone and keeps the ball on the ground and in the ballpark. 5. Jack Flaherty, DodgersLike Fried, Flaherty is a product of Harvard-Westlake High School in Southern California. Unlike Fried, consistency has not been his calling card. Even during the Dodgers’ 2024 championship run, Flaherty had two excellent playoff starts, two disastrous starts and one in between. That was representative of a highly talented pitcher who has battled injuries and significant fluctuations in both stuff and results since arriving in the big leagues. The good news for Flaherty -- and the righty’s next team -- is that he’s a bit on the younger side for a free agent (having just turned 29 in October), has mostly stayed healthy for two straight seasons and was quite effective in 2024. Flaherty looks like one of the riskier options on this list, but the potential rewards should still generate a robust market. 6. Sean Manaea, MetsIn mid-June, there was little reason to think Manaea would be anywhere close to this spot. The 32-year-old lefty, coming off a couple of underwhelming seasons with the Padres and Giants, had a 4.30 ERA over his first 12 outings with the Mets. From there, though, Manaea went 9-3 with a 3.05 ERA and more than a strikeout per inning over his final 20 outings, before making three solid postseason starts. Along the way, with Chris Sale as inspiration, the 6-foot-5 Manaea dropped his release point, to great effect. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. 7. Walker Buehler, DodgersFollowing a lengthy rehab from his second Tommy John surgery, Buehler struggled mightily to rediscover his form in 2024. The numbers were ugly: 16 starts with a 5.38 ERA, 5.54 FIP and .862 opponent OPS. This looked nothing like the pitcher who was one of the best in baseball from 2018-21, culminating in a fourth-place NL Cy Young Award finish. But, at long last, signs of that pitcher re-emerged during the postseason, just in time to help the Dodgers secure a World Series title. Was that a blip? Or a sign that Buehler is back? That’s the question teams will have to answer this offseason. 8. Yusei Kikuchi, AstrosOver six MLB seasons since making the move from NPB, Kikuchi has been unable to put it all together for an extended period of time. The left-hander has shown plenty of flashes, but consistent success has eluded him, leading to roughly league-average production (a 4.28 ERA and 96 ERA+ over 601 innings since 2021). The glass-half-full view is that Kikuchi might have found a winning formula after the Blue Jays dealt him to Houston at the Trade Deadline, posting a 2.70 ERA and 3.07 FIP in 10 starts down the stretch while dramatically ramping up his slider usage at the expense of his four-seam fastball. 9. Nathan Eovaldi, RangersDespite the fact that he will turn 35 before next season, Eovaldi opted out of his contract, passing up a $20 million guarantee in 2025. It’s not hard to understand why. Eovaldi still throws in the mid-90s, with two swing-and-miss secondary pitches in his splitter and curveball, helping him consistently post excellent chase and walk rates. He now has strung together five consecutive seasons with an ERA under 4.00 and an ERA+ over 100, and he’s a proven postseason performer. It would be no surprise to see Eovaldi land a solid multi-year deal. 10. Shane Bieber, GuardiansWhichever team signs Bieber will do so knowing that the 29-year-old righty is still working his way back from the Tommy John surgery he underwent in April. That adds plenty of uncertainty to the mix here, but also an opportunity to add a star-caliber pitcher to their rotation on a short-term commitment. Bieber was one of MLB’s top starters from 2019-22, winning the AL Cy Young Award in ‘20, and after a relatively subpar ‘23 campaign, he looked fantastic out of the gate this past season before tearing his UCL. Assuming Bieber comes back strong, he has a chance to re-enter the market as a clear ace in a year or two.

MLB News,White Sox hire Fuller from Orioles as hitting director,https://www.mlb.com/news/white-sox-ryan-fuller-director-of-hitting,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 23:38:54 GMT",,"Scott Merkin CHICAGO -- Ryan Fuller can draw from all his past coaching experiences with Baltimore as the new White Sox director of hitting, with his hiring officially announced on Thursday afternoon. Fuller, 34, served as co-hitting coach over the past three seasons for the power-packed Orioles. He was Baltimore’s full-season hitting coordinator and Double-A Bowie hitting coach for the 2021 season, and originally joined the Orioles as the Single-A Delmarva hitting coach prior to the 2020 campaign. In this newly created White Sox position, Fuller oversees all aspects of hitting throughout the organization. He’ll work with the hitting coaches at the Major League level and within the Minor Leagues, as well as the players. Offseason planning already has begun via Fuller having talks with Marcus Thames, who returns for his second year as White Sox hitting coach. “It's key for these guys to develop relationships,” Fuller said concerning the importance of Thames returning in his role from 2024. “We've been on Zoom calls virtually every day, talking to each other, asking a lot of questions: 'What's going on? What can we make improvements to? How can I support you even more?' “Both of us talking about experiences working with really high-level hitters, talking about what we can do as we look toward the player plan for the White Sox hitters going into 2025. It's been great so far. We match up really well, and it's been a great working relationship."" This position for Fuller is akin to the one held by Brian Bannister, who took over as the White Sox senior advisor to pitching on Sept. 22, 2023. Fuller has spoken to Bannister about how he’s gone about things with the White Sox but also about his past experience as a director. pic.twitter.com/PB6h0UN3JF White Sox pitching presently is well ahead of the offensive side, at the Major League and Minor League levels. The White Sox finished last in everything from home runs (133) to runs scored (507) to batting average (.221) to on-base percentage (.278) as part of their 121-loss season in 2024. Of their Top 9 prospects, per MLB Pipeline, three are on the position-player side in shortstop Colson Montgomery (No. 3), catcher Edgar Quero (No. 4) and 18-year-old outfielder George Wolkow at No. 7. So, Fuller has work to do, but he has ideas for improvement and success, as well as a synergistic message delivered throughout hitting but also to research and development and the strength staff. “We are excited to reach out to the players in the next couple of weeks to give them the offseason training goals and plans, and after that, certainly touch base with them,” Fuller said. “That’s part of being a hitting guy, getting those messages from the guys with their swings, seeing video of them working out. And I know Marcus has a plan to go out and see hitters this offseason. [I'm] excited to be a part of that and develop those relationships.” “He’s going to help on the acquisition front -- whether it be this offseason on free-agent acquisitions or trade acquisitions -- and going to help Marcus and other coaches throughout the organization put together game plans and development plans for our players,” general manager Chris Getz said of Fuller. “We know it’s a tall task to take on hitting. But we certainly know we’re an organization that needs help, and we felt like we found someone that could really supplement and help lead us to a better position for future success.” Fuller wants to equip the players with skills, plans and training to “level up” through their work. In explaining that concept, Fuller went with a video game reference. “When you play video games, you start at Level 1 and when you beat the Level 1 boss, you go to Level 2. You don’t jump to Level 30 right away,” Fuller said. “It’s going to have that feel of making sure these guys are building their skill every day. As we are building that skill, we are going to look to problem-solve.

MLB News,You can't turn down a baseball card-themed invite to Bobby Witt Jr.'s wedding,https://www.mlb.com/news/angels-logan-britt-bobby-witt-jr-best-man-topps-card,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 05:18:28 GMT",,"Jesse Borek MESA, Ariz. -- Three years into his Major League career, Bobby Witt Jr. has already had 2,035 regular-season plate appearances. That’s a lot of chances to make an impression. But when it comes to your wedding, you only get one chance to hit it out of the park. More on the Arizona Fall League:• Complete coverage | Schedule | Tickets | Teams | Shop With the AL MVP finalist set to tie the knot with fiancée Maggie Black on Dec. 14 in Texas, he sent out epic baseball card-themed invitations to his side of the wedding party. Royals teammate MJ Melendez gave the baseball world a glimpse into the intricate design. A post shared by PULLWAX SPORTS CARDS (@pullwax) But as any member of a wedding party knows, when you want the details, go straight to the best man -- Angels prospect Logan Britt. “It was pretty sick because I saw MJ Melendez’s card and he had a picture of them playing in Kansas City,” Britt said of his reaction to the cards. “Ours was actually a photo taken in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, when we were 13. I'm sitting on a bucket and he's sitting next to me. He's got the mullet rocking back in the day, so that was pretty funny.” Much like Witt’s dedication to his mullet, his bond with Britt hasn’t wavered. The two met as youngsters on the hyper-competitive Texas baseball scene, with the Witt family offering a young Britt a spot on a travel ball tournament roster in Florida. “I got to go on a family vacation with his family to the Bahamas and we've been friends ever since,” Britt said. “Just a nutty, super humble, great guy to be around. He's just a goofball and he's a friend I'll have for life.” More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage It’s fitting that the two first bonded in the Bahamas, since Witt brought his group there for his bachelor party. Britt got to meet many of the groomsmen -- Nick Pratto, Vinnie Pasquantino, Kyle Isbel, Melendez -- during a previous visit to Kansas City to see Witt a few years back, but this was their first chance to unwind and bond before the nuptials. The wedding party also includes Witt’s three brothers-in-law, all of whom are former big leaguers -- Zach Neal, James Russell and Cody Thomas -- and another player with a Colleyville (Texas) High School connection: the Braves’ AJ Smith-Shawver. Kansas City chose Witt second overall out of Colleyville in 2019, with Britt going as a 35th-round choice of the White Sox due to his strong commitment to Texas A&M. (He chose not to sign with Chicago.) Smith-Shawver, the club’s No. 2 prospect and No. 97 overall, was a seventh-round pick of Atlanta in 2021. Despite the rigors that pro ball creates, Witt and Britt have been able to stay in close contact throughout the years. They still live about half an hour from one another in Texas during the offseason. Witt’s Minor League career was short-lived as he skyrocketed through the Royals system. Britt eventually transferred to Abilene Christian, where he starred offensively, but hung up his bat for the pitcher’s mound when the Angels selected him in the 17th round of the 2023 Draft. The 24-year-old outfielder-turned-hurler is getting extra time to hone his craft in the Arizona Fall League, with eyes on one day joining Witt up at the game’s highest level. “I think it's been great for us,” Britt said. “We both kind of went different directions -- he went pro ball, I went to college, so we were both playing baseball. I think the offseason is good for us. We get to just be boys again -- play golf, mess around, do whatever.”",2024-11-14
MLB News,"Angels continue bustling offseason, agree to deal with Newman",https://www.mlb.com/news/angels-agree-to-deal-with-kevin-newman,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 22:44:00 GMT",,"Rhett Bollinger ANAHEIM -- With starting shortstop Zach Neto possibly missing the start of the 2024 season after undergoing right shoulder surgery last week, the Angels made yet another move to improve their infield depth on Thursday, agreeing to terms with infielder Kevin Newman. The contract is for one year and $2.5 million, and has an option for $2.5 million or a $250,000 buyout for '26. Newman, 31, is coming off a solid year in a utility role with the D-backs, slashing .287/.311/.375 with three homers, 17 doubles and eight stolen bases in 111 games. He saw action at all four infield positions, including 55 games at short and 44 at second, as well as an appearance in left field. Newman could fill in as the club’s starting shortstop to open the season if Neto isn’t ready to return and he provides depth with fellow infielders Luis Rengifo and Anthony Rendon both coming off injuries. Catcher Matt Thaiss was designated for assignment to make room for Newman on the roster. “We have some infielders that have had some health things in the past and are currently going through some things,” Angels general manager Perry Minasian said. “Middle infield depth, in general, is very hard to acquire, especially in this market, and we took a look at it, and we felt like this was one of the better players for us. He can move around, play both short and second, can move to third, can play some first. It's a good baseball player.” Newman holds a career .262/.305/.360 slash line in parts of seven seasons with the Pirates, Reds and D-backs. The former 2015 first-round pick’s best year was in 2019, when he slashed .308/.353./.446 with 12 homers and 20 doubles in 130 games. He’s considered a strong defender up the middle at both shortstop and second base. OFFICIAL: The Angels have agreed to a one-year contract with INF Kevin Newman. pic.twitter.com/7TBUReRlzm “He’s very good at second and is solid at short,” Minasian said. “He fits with currently how we're built and with what we currently have. He's somebody that's going to help us in a lot of different ways” It's also a return to Southern California for Newman, who attended Poway High School north of San Diego and 85 miles south of Angel Stadium. Newman is the third infielder added by the Angels this offseason, joining fellow utilityman Scott Kingery, who was acquired in a trade with the Phillies, and first baseman/outfielder Ryan Noda, who was picked up on waivers from the A’s. The Angels also traded for slugger Jorge Soler from the Braves, signed right-hander Kyle Hendricks to a one-year deal worth $3.5 million and inked catcher Travis d’Arnaud to a two-year, $12 million pact. Minasian wouldn’t rule out acquiring another infielder. The Angels could use another player who can handle third, as Rendon has been injury-prone and is coming off a rough year offensively. “I wouldn't rule anything out,” Minasian said. “It’s tough to find guys that can play on the dirt. We’ll continue to sift through things from a market standpoint, from a free agency standpoint. We definitely want to continue to improve.” Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. It’s clear the Angels are being aggressive in improving their overall depth heading into next year. They’re still in the market for another starting pitcher and relief help, and the club could use another bat. Coming off a 99-loss season, Minasian has said the team needs help everywhere and he’s been busy early this offseason. “Every area is up for grabs,” Minasian said. “There is not an area on this team where I'd say, ‘Hey, we're ready. We're perfect. We feel great.’ We'll look at every area and see if we can improve.” Minasian added it was tough to designate Thaiss, but the Angels signed d’Arnaud to be their backup to Logan O’Hoppe and Thaiss is out of options. He said they could be in the market for a third catcher with Minor League options if Thaiss is lost via waivers or trade. “We obviously made the move for d’Arnaud a couple days ago and we took our time and really thought about it,” Minasian said. “We basically went through the roster and so on. We just thought this was the best thing to do. Matt’s an outstanding individual, outstanding human being and a hard worker.”",2024-11-14
MLB News,No team needs a big winter more than Boston,https://www.mlb.com/news/red-sox-need-to-make-a-splash-in-2024-25-offseason,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:05:13 GMT",,"Mike Lupica Occasionally, but only occasionally, you can win the offseason in baseball and then go on to win the real one. The Dodgers just did that. They won the last offseason when they signed Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto. And even though Ohtani had a bum shoulder at the very end, Yamamoto won them two postseason games -- one in the World Series -- and the Dodgers finally won it all. Now, less than a month after the Dodgers closed out the Yankees at Yankee Stadium, we wait to see which team is going to have the best offseason this time -- one that might help take the title away from the Dodgers, unless Los Angeles steps up to the plate and swings for the fences like Ohtani all over again. But a better question might be this: Which team needs to have a big offseason the most? You know the Yankees, trying to keep Juan Soto, want it to be them after finally making it back to the World Series for the first time since 2009. The Mets, who also are set to meet with Soto, sure want it to be them, because they’re in the same league as the Dodgers, and they just played them a lot tougher in the National League Championship Series than the Yankees eventually did. The Phillies, knocked off by the Mets in what they once thought was finally going to be their year, want to show that their window as a Series contender isn’t closing. The Astros, who had played in seven straight American League Championship Series, want to show that the Tigers upsetting them in the Wild Card Series was a fluke. The Padres, who have been knocking on the door for a while and have shown they’re not afraid to take big swings, finally want to knock that door down. The Orioles, with all that young talent, finally want to do something with it at playoff time. But there is no team, not one, that needs to have a game-changing offseason than the Red Sox do, just because their last World Series -- the fourth for them in this century and the fourth in 15 seasons at the time -- in 2018 is starting to feel to an increasingly ornery Red Sox Nation like a long time ago, especially since the star of that team, Mookie Betts, keeps winning rings with the Dodgers after Boston traded him a year and a half after its last title. That happens to be the biggest reason of all why they need Soto every bit as much -- and perhaps even more -- than either the Yankees and Mets do, as owners Hal Steinbrenner and Steve Cohen set themselves up for their own Subway Series. Have Sox fans been spoiled by everything that has happened since October 2004, when they came from 0-3 down in the ALCS against the Yankees to change their history and change baseball history? They have. It is difficult to believe sometimes that it was just three years ago -- October 2021 -- that the Sox were two games to one ahead of the Astros in the ALCS and were that close to making it back to the Series until they stopped hitting, became one more postseason team that didn’t start hitting again until the following spring. Then the Sox finished last. And they finished last again. This past year, they managed to get back to third place in the AL East with a record of 81-81. And other than a midseason run that started with a series win over the Yankees at Fenway Park in June, they still ended up five games behind the Tigers and Royals for a Wild Card spot and 10 behind the Orioles. Here is what manager Alex Cora said when the season was over: “I truly believe this is the last struggle. I do believe we’re going to turn the corner in the offseason.” The Red Sox have to turn that corner, as a serious contender and with their fanbase, if they are serious players for Soto. What they might want to consider, when they do have their meeting with Soto and his agent, Scott Boras, is to bring David Ortiz with them. The Yankees always sell winning, of course. Ortiz, who was the greatest star of three World Series-winning teams in Boston, has known as much about winning in the 21st century as anybody in baseball. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Do the Red Sox need pitching, both starting pitching and relief pitching? They do. Does Soto alone move them past the Orioles and past the Yankees in their division? He does not. But what he does do is send the message to Red Sox fans that they mean the business of winning another World Series. And what is more of a blessing for Red Sox fans than doing something this dramatic to help their team and hurt the New York Yankees? Are the Red Sox a longshot here? They probably are. But it was just over 20 years ago that they acquired a young left-handed hitter from the Dominican named Ortiz, who really did change their history and baseball history. This is their chance to do it again with another star out of the Dominican. Ortiz only cost $1.25 million at the time. Soto will cost a lot more than that. But at this particular time in Red Sox history, he just might be worth it.",2024-11-14
MLB News,Making the case for (and against) each of Juan Soto's main suitors,https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-free-agency-rumors-favorites-to-sign-him,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 03:41:09 GMT",,"MLB.com Juan Soto, the most coveted and high-profile free agent on the market this offseason, is reportedly scheduled to meet this week with the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox and Blue Jays. While it’s certain these four clubs will not be the only ones pursuing Soto – so far, he hasn’t tipped his hand, if he has a favorite – they’re likely to be among a small group with a realistic chance to sign him. MLB.com examined the case for and against each: Which team has the edge right now? Why? Mark Feinsand, senior national reporter: The Mets. I put them at a 51-49% favorite over the Yankees, mainly because financially, they are able to keep up with, or bypass, the other potential big spenders. The Yankees are certainly right there, and if the offers wind up being close, I could see Soto choosing to stay in the Bronx to hit next to Aaron Judge for the next seven years. It’s difficult for me to see any other team doing enough to pry Soto out of New York, but that doesn’t mean the Red Sox, Blue Jays, etc., won’t give it a try. Bryan Hoch, Yankees beat reporter: Considering no team has made an official monetary offer yet, I’ll say it’s the Yankees, just based upon that he’s days removed from playing in a World Series game for them. He played his postgame comments with surgical precision after Game 5, making sure that the world knew he enjoyed his time with the Yankees, with Aaron Judge, Aaron Boone, everyone — but that his door would be open to all 30 teams. Soto knows what a 162-game season in the Bronx looks like, sounds like, feels like … and even more importantly, what the postseason was, and can be again. The Yankees have every reason in the world to dig deep and keep him. Anthony DiComo, Mets beat reporter: I think it's the Mets. I just see them as highly motivated to land a generational-type star, which makes me think they won't be outbid. And if that's true – if they really do refuse to get outbid – then does anyone really believe Soto will go elsewhere? Ian Browne, Red Sox beat reporter: Everyone around baseball is saying the Mets, which makes me think it won’t be the Mets. I’m going to keep him in the Bronx. In one year of Soto joining forces with Aaron Judge, the Yankees went from out of the playoffs in ‘23 to the World Series in ‘24. My guess is that [general manager] Brian Cashman wants to keep this modern-day Mickey Mantle/Roger Maris duo together for the coming years. Keegan Matheson, Blue Jays beat reporter: The Mets. They just got a taste of the NLCS and watched while Soto took the team across town to the World Series. If this comes down to New York vs. New York, as many in the industry expect, I’m betting on a motivated Steve Cohen. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Teams will be making their best pitch to Soto. How will they sell him on their team? The case for: Yankees: Listen, Juan, you just lived it. You had the best offensive season of your career, highlighted by a Silver Slugger, a likely top-three MVP finish and a World Series appearance. Maybe even more importantly, you know that New York loves you already — hey, that guy wasn’t out in the right-field seats carrying an oversized blank check for his health. Stay in the Bronx long-term, and you’ll hit in front of Judge again for years. You’ll hit in Yankee Stadium 81 times a year. You and Judge can chase championships together, wind up in Monument Park together and go into Cooperstown with Yankees logos on your caps. The marketing opportunities will be endless, too. What else do you need? – Hoch Mets: It's two-fold. One is the aforementioned money and their willingness to spend it. Two is the fact that they can suddenly make a really nice case about their organizational direction and ability to win. They can sell Soto like this: We'll pay you the most and also give you one of the best chances to win. … And by the way, in New York, you can continue to be an absolute alpha star. – DiComo Red Sox: The Dominican Republic native has a pretty good idea of how special a place Boston was to countrymen David Ortiz, Pedro Martinez and Manny Ramirez, though the latter certainly had some ups and downs. When the Red Sox are winning, there is no better place for a star to play, given the fervor of the fanbase. Surely, Ortiz and Martinez will try to sell Soto on this. Also, the Red Sox, after being conservative with payroll the last three seasons as they built up their young core at the Major League level and the farm system, seem ready to shell out money again for a transformational player, which Soto certainly is. – Browne Blue Jays: Signings like George Springer, Kevin Gausman and the José Berríos extension show the Blue Jays aren’t afraid to spend, but Soto will cost more than all three of those contracts combined. The Blue Jays will need to convince Soto that they’ll continue to build -- and spend -- around him for the next decade-plus. Once you get another taste of the World Series with the Yankees, why sign with the team that just finished last place in your division unless you truly believe brighter days are ahead? If the Blue Jays have any shot at Soto, it has to involve Vladimir Guerrero Jr. … First at the pitch meeting, then receiving an extension of his own. – Matheson The case against – if the money is all the same, what could make Soto decide to sign elsewhere? Yankees: I don’t believe there is a scenario where the Yankees have the top bid, or match a top bid, and Soto goes elsewhere. It may well be that Soto and [agent] Scott Boras are looking to grab every dollar on the table, and if that’s the case, there is a good chance the Yankees do not have the highest bid. Hal Steinbrenner has said that he doesn’t want to have a payroll above $300 million, calling it “unsustainable” for the franchise long-term, and industry folks say that is no bluff. Now, here’s a thought for you: The Yanks did not have the high bid for Judge, far from it. They had to match the second-place bid from the Giants to keep him; Soto isn’t offering any similar hometown discounts, at least not to the Yankees. – Hoch Mets: Maybe he really does love the Yankees and values re-signing there more than coming to Queens. Maybe the Dodgers get involved and he wants to be part of a super-team. If the money is all the same, lifestyle factors come into play, and that's an area in which the Mets – see: Yamamoto, Yoshinobu – haven't always fared well. – DiComo Red Sox: Soto might wind up loving Boston. But he already knows how much he enjoys New York after playing there for a year. This could give the Yankees and Mets an edge over the Red Sox if the money winds up being relatively equal. While the Red Sox are confident they’re ready to start winning again, Soto might be more skeptical about it given the team’s absence in October the past three years. – Browne Blue Jays: The Blue Jays are coming off a 74-88 season. Their internal optimism isn’t going to woo one of the biggest free agents in MLB history, but this gets even more difficult when Soto or any other top-end option looks at the Blue Jays’ immediate future. Will Vladdy stay in Toronto beyond 2025? If not, will money be spent to pair Soto with other legitimate stars? This could eventually reach a point where one team involved needs to tear up its projections and valuations and decide to blow everyone else out of the water entirely to get their guy. Is that really a move you’d expect to see from the Blue Jays’ front office? – Matheson",2024-11-14

If the Mets miss out on Soto, their pivot could be a windfall for other highly touted free agents.","The 2024 New York Mets were a whirlwind, an exhausting, exhilarating thrill ride of improbability. They were a ragtag group of well-paid misfits, with the magic of an anthropomorphic purple blob and a Latin pop earworm. The Mets rode the good vibes all the way to the NLCS. An MVP runner-up campaign from shortstop Francisco Lindor helped too. Here are the five main questions that will shape what’s sure to be a fascinating and active winter in Queens. Mets owner Steve Cohen is, according to Forbes, the 39th richest person in America. Since buying the Mets in 2020 for $2.4 billion, Cohen has infused a fortune into his new toy. Once a circus of frugality, the Mets organization has refurbished its reputation and is now firmly considered as one of the financial behemoths of the sport. Last offseason, the club’s first under new president of baseball operations David Stearns, the Mets focused on depth by signing a bevy of players to one-year deals. Those shrewd acquisitions helped propel the 2024 OMG Mets into the annals of New York sports history and set the Mets back on a winning path. But with so many key contributors reaching free agency, the Mets could look drastically different next season. And different could mean better considering the Mets have the financial flexibility to be extremely active. The current projected payroll comes in approximately $170 million lower than the 2024 end-of-year $336 million mark. But how high will it go? Stearns, who cut his teeth running the thrifty Milwaukee Brewers, has a track-record of operating conservatively. Cohen, on the other hand, is the anti-Scrooge. Considering how high payroll has gone before, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the Mets commit a good deal of money to free agents this winter. We know Juan Soto is going to command a contract for at least $550 million dollars, a figure that Cohen and Co. can certainly afford. Anything the Yankees offer, Cohen could theoretically reach into his endless hedge fund riches and outbid his crosstown rivals. Soto’s agent, Scott Boras, will be counting on this exact dynamic to drive up the price. And so, the Mets’ run at Soto will come down to three dynamics: Did Soto’s one year in the Bronx do enough to convince him to take less money (though still a lot of money) to be a Yankee? How high are the Yankees willing to go? Can the Mets convince Soto that Queens is the better fit for him? How the Soto sweepstakes plays out will dictate the rest of the Mets' offseason. If they reel in the big fish, they’ll operate somewhat more judiciously to fill out the roster. If the Mets miss out on Soto, their pivot could be a windfall for other highly touted free agents. Nobody has ripped more homers at Citi Field than Alonso, who delivered an underwhelming season in his final year under contract. Still, the jolly basher still clubbed 34 long balls in 2024, while finishing the year with a batting line 23% above league average. It’s also important to consider what he means to the franchise; Alonso started 86% of games at first base for the team since his debut in 2019 and is currently just 32 home runs behind the all-time Mets record of 252 held by Darryl Strawberry. By (1) staying in Queens and (2) delivering another few productive seasons would make Alonso a franchise icon. Yet, there are ample reasons to be wary of Alonso’s profile. He’s a relatively unathletic right-handed hitting first baseman on the wrong side of 30 years old who isn’t a great defender. Sluggers of that sort don’t often age well. The “smart” move would be to let Alonso walk, move 2024 breakout Mark Vientos from third (where he’s a subpar glove) to first (where he’d be fine) and find a new third baseman. That tact is far from a given and there aren’t many other players available who can offer such bankable home run power. The Mets can sign Soto and Alonso, but will they want to? Both players, as they age, would require at-bats at DH. Having two one-dimensional sluggers on the same roster could create a logjam. On the other hand, the two would form a formidable righty-lefty combo in the middle of the lineup for a long time. Will the Mets' offer end up being Alonso’s highest bid? Probably not. His free agency could come down to (1) the gap between the Mets and the next best offer and (2) whether Alonso would choose continuity over cash. The rotation was essential to New York’s surprise season, but three-fifths of that group — Sean Manaea, Luis Severino and José Quintana — are on the open market this winter. That leaves behind Japanese fork-baller Kodai Senga, who was injured for almost all of 2024, and left-hander David Peterson. Those two, if healthy, have starting spots locked down. Tylor Megill and Paul Blackburn could be in the mix, but both are best deployed as depth options. That means the Mets need to add at least two starters, but probably three. Stearns was surprisingly open about this dynamic, telling reporters at his end-of-year news conference that, “We’re going to have to add starting pitching. We’re going to have to add multiple starters. We understand that. We went into last offseason with the same need and I think we’ll be able to do it.” There’s no doubt that the Mets could use a no-doubt ace at the front of their rotation. Only three or four free-agent hurlers fit that bill: Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell, Max Fried and Roki Sasaki, with Burnes being the most reliable option. Snell has two Cy Youngs to his name, but durability concerns. Fried has a stellar track record of run prevention, but pairs best with a strong infield defense. Sasaki might have a higher ceiling than anybody on Earth, but can’t be relied upon to lead a staff right away coming from Japan. Expect the Mets, with or without Soto, to be heavy on this quartet. Beyond that, a Severino return feels the most likely, as sources indicated to Yahoo Sports that the hurler is extremely interested in a reunion. As Stearns mentioned, the Mets cobbled together quite an impressive rotation through free agency last year and they can be counted on to do so again. In the team’s four NLCS losses, the Mets surrendered nine, eight, 10 and 10 runs to the eventual World Series champions. The bullpen, in particular, was stretched thin all October long. Skipper Carlos Mendoza leaned heavily on the two or three arms he trusted — Edwin Díaz, Ryne Stanek, Reed Garrett — because he didn’t have much else. That wasn’t an issue in shorter series during the wild-card round and the NLDS, but in a seven-game set against the Dodgers, the Mets got exposed. The Mets need more relievers and better ones, hurlers they can trust in huge postseason spots. It’s unlikely they shop at the high end of the bullpen market considering they already have a big-money guy back there in Díaz. But expect Stearns to add a handful of relievers on shorter-term deals, particularly those with experience in big games. Kirby Yates, Blake Treinen and Jeff Hoffman all fit the bill.",2024-11-14

Dave Sims is reportedly close to an agreement to become the team's new play-by-play broadcaster on WFAN, as first reported by the New York Post's Ryan Glasspiegel. A verbal agreement is already in place and a two-year deal is expected to be signed soon, according to The Athletic's Andrew Marchand. Sims, 71, has called games on the Seattle Mariners' TV broadcasts for the past 17 seasons. He replaces John Sterling, who retired from the radio booth early last season after 35 years due to health concerns. Sims will partner with Suzyn Waldman on the radio broadcasts. Last season, Justin Shackil called most of the Yankees games on radio with Waldman while Emmanuel Berbari was also part of the mix. Rickie Ricardo, who calls the Yankees' Spanish language broadcasts, was also reportedly under consideration. For Sims, calling the Yankees is a return to New York, where he began his media career as a reporter for the New York Daily News. He then moved to radio as the host of WNBC's ""SportsNight"" and eventually co-hosted the WFAN midday show with Ed Coleman. Additionally, he was a weekend sports anchor at WCBS and a host for the New York Knicks' radio broadcasts. During his career, Sims also covered track and field for NBC during the 1988 Summer Olympics, called college basketball for Fox and FS1, and broadcasted NFL games, including ""Sunday Night Football,"" for Westwood One. Sims began calling baseball telecasts for ESPN before joining Root Sports' Mariners broadcast team in 2007. He is one of 10 finalists (along with Sterling) for the 2025 Ford C. Frick Award, presented by the Baseball Hall of Fame for excellence in baseball broadcasting. In 2012, Sims called two perfect games — first by Philip Humber, then Félix Hernández — and one Mariners' run to the postseason in 2022. Yankees fans certainly hope he'll call many more postseason runs for their team.",2024-11-14

But almost no one expected whose reckoning it would be. Tennessee travels to Athens this weekend to challenge the University of Georgia in one of only two games matching ranked teams. (The other is No. 23 Missouri at No. 21 South Carolina. Knock yourselves out, y’all.) It’s not a surprise that both the Vols and Dawgs are coming into the weekend highly ranked. It is, however, a surprise at where they sit. One-loss Tennessee arrives in Athens with a clear path to the SEC championship and a first-round CFP bye. Head coach Josh Heupel and quarterback Nico Iamaleava have at last delivered a team worthy of the hue and cry of Neyland Stadium, and they’ve got the bones of Alabama buried in the checkerboard turf to prove it. Two-loss Georgia, on the other hand, suddenly finds itself outside of the current (meaningless) playoff bracket and very much on the verge of missing the entire 12-team playoff. It’s quite the fall for the 2021-22 national champions, who had fully expected the Kirby Smart juggernaut to deliver title after title in the post-Nick Saban era. And, of course, that could still happen. But it’s a whole lot harder for Georgia now, meaning it’s a whole lot harder for everybody. The transfer portal, NIL riches (which can have both positive and negative effects) and the absolute necessity of staying locked-in, every Saturday of every fall have all led to this: another Game of the Year in a season already full of them. Heupel, like all SEC coaches in the 21st century, knows exactly how to craft the proper respectful-while-saying-nothing statement on his upcoming opponent. “Extremely talented, coached extremely well,"" he said earlier this week. ""They play hard. They play fundamentally sound. They make you earn it in every way, and one that will be a great, great environment ... ” You get the idea. Nobody puts motivational material on bulletin boards any more; social media handles that job just fine. Heupel understands how not to end up on an Instagram image with “We’re gonna kennel the Dawgs” or some other inflammatory line emblazoned in front of him. It’s wise strategy, even if it doesn’t make for thrilling content. Smart, on the other hand, did a fine job of creating some social media heat this week, although he trained it on his own team rather than Tennessee. He called one of his own players an “idiot” for celebrating with Ole Miss (technically, with his friends wearing Ole Miss gear), then walked that back. The big question for Tennessee is the health of Iamaleava. The Knoxville News reported this week that the electric quarterback is in concussion protocol, although no official announcement has been made. Heupel proclaimed Iamaleava in “great shape” on Monday, but a Wednesday report listed him as “questionable.” Iamaleava’s availability is likely the key reason behind oddsmakers’ 10-point-and-increasing line that’s favoring Georgia right now. On the other side of the ball, Georgia faces significant questions about its identity. Which Bulldog squad will show up Saturday? The fearsome crew that eviscerated Texas and Clemson on the road and rallied from down 28-0 against Alabama? Or the tentative, directionless gang that struggled against Kentucky and looked lost against Ole Miss? Will Carson Beck look like the Heisman hopeful of his early season, or the interception provider of recent weeks? Beck’s 12 interceptions lead the SEC, and each one is a dagger in the Dawgs’ fading hopes of dominating the conference again. So what’s at stake here? It’s tough to divine the CFP committee’s exact motives, but losses — regardless of opponent — will weigh heavily in their calculations. That’s bad news for Georgia, which can’t afford another L on the record and expect to make the playoff field. (Is a three-loss Georgia better than a two-loss program from another conference? Probably, but you are what your record says you are.) For Tennessee, a defeat drops the Vols into the bubbling cauldron of two-loss SEC teams. Momentum and a current high ranking ought to be enough to carry Tennessee into the playoffs, and probably a hosting slot — assuming Tennessee wins out, of course, with Vanderbilt lurking. But a victory would almost certainly result in an SEC championship berth against the winner of Texas-Texas A&M — again, assuming that favorites win out. So that’s what we’re looking at this weekend: A chance for one program to level up, a chance for the other to hold off the darkness. It’s exactly what we want out of a late-season college football game. How about that? The playoffs didn’t ruin the regular season after all.",2024-11-14
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football Week 11 Fades: Can you trust Najee Harris?,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-week-11-fades-can-you-trust-najee-harris-175054452.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 17:50:54 GMT",Beware of these six players with fantasy football bust potential in Week 11!,"Another week, another round of crucially important start/sit decisions. To help you make them, here's a look at six players with bust potential in Week 11. Something to keep in mind as you're reading: a ""fade"" or ""bust"" designation doesn't automatically mean you should sit a player, depending on the depth of the rest of your roster or available options on your waiver wire. Kirk Cousins has had a solid bounce-back season coming off a ruptured Achilles that ended his 2023 campaign. Through 10 weeks, he ranks as fantasy's QB10, ranked third in passing yards (2,634) and tied for the fourth-most passing touchdowns (17) — a great fit so far with WRs Drake London and Darnell Mooney, TE Kyle Pitts and RB Bijan Robinson in the passing game. But his opponent this week, the Broncos, are tied for the third-lowest EPA per pass attempt (-0.21) while ranking fourth in the league with a 39.2% pressure rate and the second-highest sack total in the league (35), only behind the New York Giants. Per PFF, Cousins has had the sixth-highest turnover-worthy play rate among QBs with 25+ pressured dropbacks this season at 7.3%, throwing for 5 TDs and 7 INTs on such plays. Heat check 🔥 Kirk Cousins belongs on most fantasy benches this week outside of two-QB and Superflex leagues. The Pittsburgh Steelers' run game has come alive in recent weeks after a relatively slow start this season, thanks in a big way to RB Najee Harris heating up down the stretch (as is typical for him historically). Unfortunately, there are some reasons to pump the breaks on Harris' upside for fantasy heading into Week 11. Just last week, he snapped a three-game streak of 100+ rushing yards in Week 10 (the first such streak of his career) against a Commanders defense that has been fairly friendly toward the run, averaging just 2.5 yards per attempt on 21 carries. Meanwhile, teammate Jaylen Warren saw 14 total carries — tied for the second-most he's ever seen in a single game, another week removed from a knee injury that's plagued him since Week 3. This week, Harris will not only have to overcome questions about the workload split between him and Warren but also face a challenging matchup against the Baltimore Ravens — one of the league's top rushing defenses through 10 weeks of the season. The Ravens are allowing a league-low 3.4 rush yards per play, allowing the fewest runs of 10+ yards, giving up the fewest yards after contact per attempt (2.21) while allowing the third-lowest EPA per rush attempt -0.18. Where the Ravens have been most susceptible to opposing RBs this year is in the receiving game, having allowed the third-most receiving yards (470) to the position all season — fitting, as teams are often in the position to play catch-up against the Ravens' highly potent offense. Even if the Steelers' defense is able to slow Lamar Jackson and Co. down, it's a game script that could favor Warren, if he's healthy enough to go in Week 11, having missed Thursday's practice with a back injury. In Week 10, Warren ran 15 routes, while Harris ran just seven. Heat check 🔥 Consider Harris more of a boom/bust, touchdown-dependent fantasy asset this week than a must-start. Warren, meanwhile, warrants consideration as a flex option, especially in full-PPR scoring formats as long as he is active. It is challenging to envision fading a running back that has had 20 or more touches over three of his past five games and scored in all but three outings so far in 2024. However, with a matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 11, fantasy football managers should be bracing themselves for a boom/bust performance that falls outside of Cook's typically safe floor. In Week 11, the Bills will host the Kansas City Chiefs, who have been right alongside the Ravens in terms of their ability to shut down the run this season. They are giving up a league-low 12.01 fantasy points per game to opposing RBs. They're the only defense to have given up fewer than 500 rushing yards to opposing backs, allowing the fourth-lowest EPA per rush attempt (-0.16) and the second-lowest yards per play average (3.7). Up against a similarly skilled rushing defense in the Baltimore Ravens in Week 4, the Bills were wildly outpaced, leaving Cook with just 48 yards on 10 total touches (0 TDs) for an RB44 finish on the day. Heat check 🔥 Start Cook as the top running back in a highly potent Bills offense that could see plenty of scoring, but be wary that this could be an inefficient spot that could render him a rather volatile asset this week. I didn't have to reach very far for this Week 11 fade, but it felt necessary to say just this once — you are not obligated to start DJ Moore (or any other Bears receiver, for that matter) until this team finds some sort of identity. The team has officially moved on from former OC Shane Waldron, but it will likely take more than a new play-caller to undo the damage that has been done and the regression the offense has seen since coming out of their bye week. Moore is a good wide receiver who many will feel implored to start due to his name value, but he has failed to clear more than 33 receiving yards in each of his last four games, finishing outside of the top 50 at his position in each of those games. His floor is simply too low to be trusted in even the most dire of situations. This week, the Bears will host the Green Bay Packers — a unit that ranks top-10 in average time to pressure and has been one of the most productive defenses in terms of forcing turnovers (18 total on the year). This could be another ugly one for the entire Bears offense, outside of RB D'Andre Swift. Heat check 🔥 Do. Not. Start. I'm begging you. Atlanta Falcons WR Drake London has thrived with new QB Kirk Cousins, scoring as the overall WR4 in fantasy through the first 10 weeks of the season, having totaled the fifth-most receptions (58) and eighth-most receiving yards (649) while ranking third in the position in total touchdowns. That all sounds fine and dandy until you put it up against the vaunted Denver Broncos defense, however. The biggest problem on that defense for London? All-Pro cornerback, Patrick Surtain II. Here's a look at some of Surtain II's advanced stats in coverage and where that ranks among CBs to play at least 200 coverage snaps this season: 10% target rate in coverage (second-lowest) 0.6 yards per snap allowed (tied-fewest) -0.68 EPA per target (lowest) 57.5 NFL passer rating when targeted (fourth-lowest) Simply put, Surtain isn't targeted often in coverage because he's so efficient when opposing QBs try to make it happen. WRs DK Metcalf, George Pickens, Mike Evans and Garrett Wilson managed just 15.6 fantasy points combined against this defense — in big part, thanks to Surtain's ability to lockdown perimeter receivers. Heat check 🔥 London isn't a must-start in Week 11 if you have better options, though most rosters probably don't have the luxury to sit him. Though Zay Flowers found some success against this defense in Week 10, most of that production came out of the slot, having played a season-low 47.1% of snaps on the perimeter in that game. If London does primarily work along the outside, he's likely in line for a quiet afternoon. There aren't many tight ends you can afford to fade on any given week, but given the current state of Jacksonville's offense, a warning about a potential decrease in production for Evan Engram seems warranted. They'll be without starting quarterback Trevor Lawrence again this week — he's dealing with a shoulder injury — which means it's Mac Jones at the helm once again going up against the Detroit Lions. The Lions are allowing the ninth-lowest EPA per dropback on slot + inline targets, giving up plenty of yardage in coverage of these areas of the field but little scoring (4 TD, 6 INT) in such coverage, resulting in the second-fewest fantasy points per game given up to opposing tight ends. They've allowed just one touchdown to the position all season, which doesn't bode well for a passing offense that didn't manage a single passing touchdown just last week, as Jones totaled just 139 passing yards on 22 attempts while also throwing two interceptions. Heat check 🔥 Given Engram's role in the offense as a primary slot target when Christian Kirk is out, you'll be hard-pressed to find many options you'd prefer over Engram in this economy. However, it could be a bumpy outing if Engram doesn't see significant volume.",2024-11-14

Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football Make or Break: When will Nick Chubb BE Nick Chubb again?,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-make-or-break-when-will-nick-chubb-be-nick-chubb-again-172320358.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 17:23:20 GMT",Fantasy football analyst Tera Roberts breaks down the cases of five players who have several question marks surrounding them in Week 11.,"Shifting perspectives and changing roles are major themes in this week’s make-or-break list. As we get closer to the end of the fantasy season, we think we know the majority of players and what to expect from them moving forward. However, it’s not always as clear-cut as you’d think and matchups aren’t the only issue. Sometimes we have to adjust our expectations of players and offenses moving forward to truly understand the potential, or lack thereof, with players. I don’t often include quarterbacks, but Bo Nix was in the make-or-break column last week. I highlighted his potential upside in a surprisingly favorable matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs, and he delivered as the QB12 on the week. This week, I want to discuss Maye with a similar thought process — that Maye can still thrive even in a less-than-ideal matchup. When Maye took over as the official starter in Week 6, it was messy but highly productive from a fantasy perspective. He finished as QB8 against Houston and QB7 against Jacksonville. Since then, Maye has gone through rookie woes. To be fair, these struggles have come against very formidable pass defenses, including the New York Jets, Tennessee Titans and Chicago Bears, with the Jets matchup being the week he missed most of the game due to injury. All things considered, Maye has been solid. While his passing has been inconsistent, his rushing ability has provided a reliable floor. This week, he faces a promising matchup against the L.A. Rams. The Rams’ defense is vulnerable, particularly their secondary, but their pass rush has improved as the season has progressed. The Rams have bet big on young talent, and while it took them time to acclimate to the NFL and find their groove, they’ve now become a more aggressive pass-rushing unit. A young, aggressive rush against a shaky offensive line can spell trouble, and Maye may not have the time he needs to exploit the secondary fully. That said, if Maye is forced to bail out of the pocket, it bodes well for his rushing upside. While the Rams’ defensive line could make this a tough matchup, Maye still offers strong upside as a streaming option, especially for fantasy teams that need to take a risk and pull out a win. I do live Q&A on Yahoo’s social channels every week and on my Tuesday live this week, I got a very timely question: when is Nick Chubb going to be Nick Chubb? Fantasy managers welcomed Chubb back in Week 7 with open arms. Reminiscing on the good old days, we always knew what to expect with Nick Chubb: a hefty workload, high yardage, strong yards per carry and touchdowns. While expectations were tempered coming off a significant injury, Chubb’s return has been fruitless from a fantasy perspective. Part of this can be attributed to the overall struggles of the Cleveland offense, but the numbers tell a clear story: Chubb has yet to exceed 52 rushing yards, has just one touchdown, averages 2.69 yards per carry and has no receiving upside. He’s failed to reach double-digit fantasy points in half-PPR. In all fairness, his last two matchups were against Baltimore and the L.A. Chargers. The Chargers have consistently been stout against the run and the Ravens have shut down running backs all season. In fact, Chubb’s 52 yards were the most by any back against the Ravens this season. Despite these challenges, fantasy managers remain optimistic that, in the perfect matchup, Chubb can return to form. This week offers strong potential. While his snap count hasn’t been particularly high, Chubb has dominated touches out of the backfield. The opportunity is there; it’s just a question of whether he can capitalize on it in an excellent matchup. This week, he faces a Saints defense that has been lit up by running backs this season, allowing the third-most fantasy points to the position. It’s also critical to note that it hasn’t taken top-tier talent to boost those points. Sean Tucker’s one-week-wonder and Javonte Williams' sole RB1 performance both came against New Orleans. This is the perfect matchup for Chubb to deliver his breakout performance of the season. The tides are turning in Denver, and they’re definitely not turning in favor of the aforementioned Javonte Williams. The Broncos didn’t hide their intentions when discussing Estimé recently, saying his workload would increase as the season progressed. Most expected a gradual ramp-up, but Sean Payton surprised everyone by completely flipping the Denver backfield in Week 10. Estimé had 14 carries for 53 yards, while Williams had just one carry for one yard and Jaleel McLaughlin had four carries for 12 yards. Estimé’s snap count wasn’t significantly high, but he did out-snap Williams. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Estimé wasn’t targeted in the passing game, while Williams appeared to be the preferred option with two receptions on two targets. Though it’s not much, it’s something to monitor since Estimé would need some receiving upside to be a reliable RB2. There’s a positive sign, though — Estimé did run a similar number of routes to Williams, so we might see his game evolve as the season progresses. This week’s matchup is risky. The Falcons allow volume to running backs, but rushing touchdowns have been rare — only Kenneth Walker III and Alvin Kamara have scored rushing touchdowns against them. While Estimé might see good volume, without touchdown potential and with limited receiving upside, he’s an extremely risky play. There’s also the question of whether or not we can actually trust Sean Payton. This wouldn’t be the first time a running back saw a sudden spike in carries only for Payton to switch things up the following week. I trust that Estimé has a real chance to retain the lead role, but I feel we need one more week before we can truly rely on anyone in the Broncos’ run game. Gus Edwards is back and fantasy managers now face a difficult situation with the Chargers’ backfield. In Weeks 6 through 9, while Edwards was on IR, Dobbins was the clear lead back. During that stretch, Dobbins ranked as the RB13 in half-PPR, averaging 15.9 fantasy points per game with two top-12 finishes. Edwards’ return has significantly cut into Dobbins’ volume. He had just 15 carries for 50 yards and three receptions for five yards, compared to Edwards’ 10 carries for 55 yards. While his performance was underwhelming from a fantasy perspective, Dobbins still has the edge in this backfield and should continue to see the bulk of carries. Edwards doesn’t contribute to the passing game, and when both are healthy, Dobbins has seen goal-line opportunities, so there’s no reason to expect Dobbins will be removed from the backfield when the Chargers are near the end zone. While Dobbins’ volume is at risk, the Chargers have a favorable matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals, with an expected point total of 47.5. This matchup should favor Dobbins, but with Edwards back, Dobbins has entered make-or-break territory. Still, his receiving upside and the advantageous Week 11 matchup lean slightly in his favor. I discussed DJ Moore in my Sunday Pulse Check article, so it should come as no surprise that he’s firmly a make-or-break player — emphasis on the break. Let’s not bury the lead here: Chicago’s pass catchers are unreliable across the board. We gave the Chicago offense the benefit of the doubt, lulled into optimism before their bye week when they faced favorable matchups that allowed Caleb Williams to thrive. Reality has set in again, and over the past three weeks, Moore hasn’t exceeded five fantasy points in half-PPR formats, with his best finish at WR55. We’re in a dire situation with Moore; his target share has been underwhelming and inconsistent as Rome Odunze continues to emerge in Chicago’s receiving corps. When each receiver is getting a fairly even share of the targets, this offense is unlikely to be productive from a fantasy perspective. Positive changes might be coming, as the Bears have rightly fired Shane Waldron. But can firing Waldron truly resolve the offensive issues? It seems highly unlikely. While Waldron’s vision was flawed, the Chicago offensive line continues to struggle, limiting Williams’ effectiveness. At this point, Moore is a boom-bust player, and the “boom” seems like a rare occurrence. This week he faces a Packers defense that has been a turnover machine and relatively strong against the pass. Moore is a very risky start this week and moving forward.",2024-11-14
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football Week 11 sleepers: Audric Estimé seeks to run away with Broncos RB1 job,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-week-11-sleepers-audric-estime-seeks-to-run-away-with-broncos-rb1-job-165236155.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 16:52:36 GMT",Are your lineups in need of some assistance? Consider one of these Week 11 sleepers from fantasy football analyst Scott Pianowski.,"Week 10 was a messy week for scoring, and the Sleeper Page felt the brunt of that. Ricky Pearsall got home on a nifty touchdown at Tampa Bay, but the rest of the sheet was filled with bricks. That's life. We're onto Week 11. Everyone listed below, as usual, is rostered in fewer than 50% of Yahoo leagues as we go to press. Normally we think of a Baltimore-Pittsburgh game as the ultimate rock fight, with the first team to 17 points the likely winner. That's not the shape this year. Lamar Jackson is playing the best football of his career — a big statement given that he's already won two MVP awards — and the Baltimore secondary has been a sieve all season (22 touchdown passes allowed, 294.9 passing yards per game). The Ravens could also be without safety Kyle Hamilton, a key piece. Wilson has been steady as a fantasy pick since joining the lineup, grading out as QB3, QB24 and QB9. He's yet to get past 30 pass attempts yet, but with the game total set at 48.5, Pittsburgh will probably be more aggressive than usual. Perhaps we need to give Estimé more props for last week's 14-53-0 line at Kansas City — the Chiefs, after all, are a nightmare to run on this year. The Falcons' front seven is also a plus unit, but it's not in Kansas City's class. The Broncos are at home and a mild favorite, so game script will likely favor Estimé. And even if he doesn't get any work in the passing game — he's yet to catch an NFL pass, after 17 grabs his final year at Notre Dame — Estimé probably has 13-15 touches already in his back pocket. The goal-line work will probably be his, too. It's surprising his roster tag is so low, given that Jeudy has 19 targets and a credible 12-152-0 line since Jameis Winston took over as the Cleveland starting quarterback. The Saints' secondary is the 11th-easiest for opposing wideouts to score against, and obviously it lost Marshon Lattimore to a trade two weeks ago. Cedric Tillman looks like the first read for Winston, but Winston certainly prefers targeting wideouts downfield as opposed to taking the safe checkdown. Jeudy can easily return value as a WR3 this week. His role continues to expand, with nine catches and 18 targets over the past three games. And that run came against three difficult matchups in a row. Boutte now takes aim at a Rams secondary that's handed out the eighth-most points to opposing wide receivers. New England certainly trusts Boutte; he's played 96% and 97% of the snaps the past two weeks. The Patriots were able to beat Chicago with a buttoned-up game plan, but they'll probably need to be more pass-friendly if they want to hang with the Rams. Hill has crept over the threshold for inclusion in this column, but he's a sound enough play that we'll color outside the lines and push him into the mix. Hill always carries a heavy chunk of goal-line equity into any matchup, and note he lost an 88-yard touchdown last week to penalty. Alvin Kamara is obviously the featured guy in the New Orleans offense, but there's room for someone else to collect 5-8 carries, and that could be Hill. Mix in a handful of catches and maybe some goal-line work and Hill has a plausible case to land in the top 10 at tight end. With Trey McBride and Cade Otton unavailable this week (perhaps Dalton Kincaid, too), Hill could be a reasonable fill-in. He hasn't scored a touchdown yet, and goal-line equity is what we look at most of the time with tight end sleepers. But Dissly does have 24 catches in his last five games and the Chargers appear to be souring on Hayden Hurst, who dropped his only look in Week 10. Dissly might be a pickup that you hold for a while because the next five LAC opponents have struggled to mark the tight end. Justin Herbert is playing at a high level but the volume hasn't been there most weeks; perhaps the Cincinnati offense can force the Chargers out of their comfort zone in Week 11.",2024-11-14
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Scott Boras shares Bregman nugget that could lead All-Star to Boston,https://sports.yahoo.com/scott-boras-shares-bregman-nugget-185610879.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 18:56:10 GMT","Alex Bregman seemed like a challenging fit for the Red Sox in free agency, but his agent's recent admission might change that, writes John Tomase.","Scott Boras shares Bregman nugget that could lead All-Star to Boston originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston Now here's a piece of news that may have slipped under the radar, but could have ramifications for the Red Sox: Free agent Alex Bregman is willing to move to second base. As the Red Sox try to get more right-handed this winter, Bregman looks like an obvious fit – with one major exception. Because he plays the same position as Rafael Devers, slotting him onto the roster at his natural spot of third base won't be easy. Bregman just won his first Gold Glove and has long been one of the best defensive third basemen in baseball. He just had the misfortune of sharing a league with Matt Chapman for most of his nine-year career, thus denying him that hardware. (Chapman switched leagues this year and recently won his fifth Gold Glove, with the Giants). There's no question Bregman would represent a significant defensive upgrade over the inconsistent Devers, but such moves aren't made in a vacuum, and Devers' ego must be taken into consideration, especially since he's the highest-paid player in club history at $313 million. He has made it clear he considers himself a third baseman and derives part of his identity from manning the position. The Red Sox must weigh the mental repercussions of any move. And that's to say nothing of the domino effect it would have on the rest of the roster. Does Devers take first base and force a trade of Triston Casas? Does he shift to designated hitter, where Masataka Yoshida is in the middle of a $90 million contract? Does Yoshida need to then take his subpar glove back to the outfield? Second base is an entirely different story. The Red Sox traded left-hander Chris Sale to the Braves last year for young infielder Vaughn Grissom on the assumption that he'd take over the double play pivot and join the club's promising young prospect core as a key part of the next great Red Sox team. So much for that. While Sale won the pitching triple crown in the National League and is the overwhelming favorite to claim the first Cy Young Award of his illustrious career, Grissom practically played himself off the roster. He battled injury and illness while hitting just .190 and exhibiting worrisome throwing mechanics. He's now merely one of many competing for the job, rather than the entrenched incumbent. Enter Bregman. His agent, Scott Boras, highlighted Bregman's place at the center of the recent Astros juggernaut. He's well-known across baseball as a leader and heart-and-soul kind of player, and he's no stranger to the big stage. Boras then just dropped this little nugget: ""You just don't have many players on the dirt that do what he does,"" Boras told reporters, including Bob Nightengale of USA TODAY. ""Also that Bregman can play second base, third base, his leadership, it's a market certainly that the Astros are very aware is very healthy to him."" Second base? Boras says nothing unintentionally, and that comment is surely designed to expand Bregman's market. Suddenly the Red Sox make much more sense as a destination. Bregman is a superstar, and putting him at second base would solve two problems without impacting the team's prospect pool or the rest of the roster. He has only played nine games there in his career, but he has made 129 appearances at short, and we've already mentioned he's a Gold Glover at third. Even if the 6-foot, 190-pounder is no longer than 9-WAR player with 40-homer power of five years ago, he's still damn good as he enters his age-31 season. ALEX BREGMAN WALKS IT OFF FOR THE ASTROS 💥 pic.twitter.com/cJLG0ZqvNp — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) July 28, 2024 And while some might argue that the second base job should go to prospect Kristian Campbell, there's no comparison between a rookie and an established star like Bregman, besides which, Campbell can also play shortstop and outfield; there are other ways to get his bat into the lineup if that's the goal. Signing Bregman would also open the possibility of making Campbell the centerpiece of a deal for young pitching, should management choose to fill any rotation openings that way. The Athletic's Tim Britton projects that Bregman will receive a six-year, $180 million contract. Given how poorly Boras's clients performed last year while awaiting big paydays that never came, perhaps his guys will be more amenable to signing earlier this time around. That could make Bregman a perfect solution for the Red Sox in an unexpected fashion, with the added bonus of establishing that, this offseason, the Red Sox really do plan to make a splash.",2024-11-14

Andy Behrens gets you ready to wheel and deal.,"The following is an excerpt from the latest edition of Yahoo's fantasy football newsletter, Get to the Points! If you like what you see, you can subscribe for free here. Look, there are plenty of weeks within the fantasy calendar when you can afford to switch to auto-pilot for a few days and not focus obsessively on your team — but this week, right now, isn't one of them. It’s time to lock in, people. We are careening toward the Yahoo default trade deadline on Saturday, so there’s work to be done. When you wake up on Sunday morning, one of the essential paths to improving your roster will be closed for the season. Everyone enjoys trading, so let’s get to it. Our mission is to give you three key pieces of trade advice and then offer some fantasy buy-low candidates to target. Every league has that one manager who approaches trades by thinking only of the players they’d like to dump, not the holes other teams may need to fill. A few times each season, that person will spam the league with Kadarius Toney offers (or similar), then complain that no one is ever willing to trade. The tiniest amount of pre-offer consideration can go such a long way. Take 30 seconds to review the roster of the team you intend to deal with, then propose something to help both parties. If your offer doesn’t include anything that can obviously improve the other manager’s squad, then it’s simply a time-waster, not a conversation starter. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. A decent guiding principle in fantasy trades is that if you land the best individual player in the deal, you did well. We’ve reached the point in the fantasy season when contending teams need to focus on constructing the best possible starting rosters, sacrificing depth in the process. We should be looking to maximize weekly scoring potential. Roster depth is a funny thing — it’s incredibly valuable in September and not at all in December. Each week, it becomes less important. By the time we hit the money weeks of the playoffs, your starting lineup should be so loaded that it basically sets itself, while your bench should be full of lottery tickets. Some of you are simply not wired to follow this advice, which is too bad. At some point down the road, it’s gonna cost you a fantasy title. We should never get so paralyzed by the fear of losing a deal that we forget the real priority, which is to hold the league trophy at the end of the season. If a trade can improve your team’s starting roster, it’s probably worth making. The whole idea is to deal from areas of surplus to address weaknesses. If both sides feel moderately uncomfortable with the deal, then it’s probably a winner. Here are five early-season underperformers who are A) strong candidates for positive regression, B) endlessly frustrating to the manager who drafted them, and C) obtainable via trade at a discount relative to their draft prices: He’s apparently dealing with one of the worst quadriceps injuries in the history of quads, because it’s already cost him three games. While he’s making progress, he's no lock to face the Chargers on Sunday. Let’s just please remember that when healthy this year, he’s been his usual self, averaging 9.0 targets and 68.2 receiving yards per game. If he’s good-to-go in December, he’s an obvious potential difference-maker. Few players are as chronically disrespected as Jacobs. He’s pretty much always available via trade, despite being one of the NFL’s most elusive runners. According to PFF, Jacobs currently ranks among the leaders in missed tackles forced (33) and yards after contact (3.73 per carry). He’s tied to an upper-tier offense, yet he’s only reached the end zone four times this season. Jacobs is the RB17 on the season at the moment, but he’s a clear candidate to enjoy a post-bye surge. We are nearing the end of the original recovery timeline from the fractured leg Pacheco suffered back in September. He should not have much difficulty reclaiming the primary rushing role for KC. Kareem Hunt has been a terrific waiver find this season, but he hasn’t exactly delivered a convincing impersonation of a healthy Pacheco. Hunt is averaging just 3.6 YPC and the underlying numbers are somehow less impressive. Only five of his 125 carries have gained 10 or more yards and he’s averaging just 2.36 yards after contact per attempt. Earth’s best quarterback is still outside the position’s top-12 in terms of year-to-date fantasy scoring, plus he’s headed into a dicey matchup at Buffalo. It’s an excellent time to buy. He’s thrown six touchdown passes over his last three games while averaging 273 passing YPG, so it’s already apparent that his weekly upside has returned with DeAndre Hopkins now in the mix. Pretty gross, right? Yeah, we know. But again, the idea here is to flag good players who can actually be acquired via trade. Johnson is actually gonna hit a few waiver wires this week after back-to-back dud performances for Baltimore. He was never a great bet to put up numbers in his first game for the Ravens following a mid-season trade, however — and then his second game was a Thursday nighter, which left little time for his role to expand. He’s a proven multi-year producer and one of the best separators in the game, so we don’t have to worry about his ability to leapfrog guys like Nelson Agholor in this team’s receiving hierarchy.",2024-11-14

Dalton Del Don attempts to identify misleading numbers that are worth a closer look. Yes ... The Numbers Do Lie. Ridley has averaged 10.7 targets, 6.7 catches and 100.0 receiving yards while scoring two touchdowns over three games since DeAndre Hopkins was traded. He’s been fantasy’s WR5 in points per game over that span. Ridley sports a 32% TPRR (targets per route run), 3.03 YPRR and a 41% first-read target rate since Hopkins left, which are WR1 numbers. It's a small sample, but it’s also encouraging Ridley maintained production after Will Levis returned last week. Moreover, Ridley has the third easiest remaining schedule for wide receivers after having the league’s toughest until now. Ridley’s impressive rates will regress some, and this is still an offense with a lowly 16.75-point implied total this week (when Levis may struggle versus Minnesota’s blitzing). But Ridley’s usage with Hopkins gone has been undeniable, and he suddenly looks like a top-20 WR down the stretch (even if some duds are sprinkled in). Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Herbert has been fantasy’s QB21 in points per game, but he’s been the QB9 over the last four weeks. He’s getting a career-high 7.8 YPA with an 11:1 TD:INT ratio, but volume has been a problem for his fantasy production. The Chargers rank 25th in pass plays per game. Los Angeles has allowed just 13.1 points per game, which would be top 15 in NFL history if the season ended. The Chargers’ red-zone defense (38.9%) is likely to regress. Moreover, L.A.’s favorable schedule has been loaded with low projected totals, but the Chargers’ upcoming matchups should feature many more shootouts. Herbert’s had the 10th hardest QB fantasy schedule so far, but he has the sixth easiest rest-of-season. The Chargers are one of just nine teams with a positive pass rate over expectation over the last month, as Los Angeles has thrown decidedly more since its bye. Herbert has also run more since L.A.’s bye, which is possibly a sign his foot is feeling better. Different upcoming game scripts will help Herbert’s terrific performance translate more into fantasy production. His season rank is highly misleading. Brown played a career-high 89% of the snaps last week when he saw all 24 RB opportunities. Newcomer Khalil Herbert played two snaps and botched a handoff resulting in a fumble, leading to a Leonard Fournette workout Monday. Brown had a season-high 75% route participation and saw a career-high 11 targets. He’s seen 100% of the Bengals’ RB touches over the last two weeks, including a whopping nine opportunities inside the 10-yard line. With Zack Moss out for the season, Brown has Cincinnati’s backfield to himself. Brown has been fantasy’s RB3 since Moss went down despite a matchup in Baltimore last week against a Ravens’ defense allowing just 56.8 RB rushing yards per game. Joe Burrow has looked fantastic, so Brown is in a terrific situation. He gets a tough matchup on the road against the Chargers this week and then a bye, but Brown should be treated as a top-12 back down the stretch. Jennings ranks 50th among pass catchers in receptions this season, but his volume will continue to increase with Brandon Aiyuk out for the season. Jennings led San Francisco in routes run, targets, catches, air yards and receiving yards during his first game without Aiyuk last week. He had the league’s sixth-highest first-read target share (38.5%) last week, and Brock Purdy owns the league’s fourth-best Passer Rating (134.5) when targeting Jennings. He ranks second in the NFL in yards per route run, eighth in fantasy points per route run and 10th among 117 pass catchers in ESPN’s Receiving Score. Jennings owns a 32% TPRR with Aiyuk off the field, and he’s now replaced BA as the 49ers’ “X” receiver. Jennings erupted for 41 fantasy points in Week 3 with Deebo Samuel Sr. out — the only other game in which he’s acted as SF’s WR2. Jennings isn’t Terrell Owens 2.0, but he can clearly play; he’ll now see a much bigger opportunity on a potent offense due for major red-zone regression. The 49ers’ offense looks crowded with Christian McCaffrey back, but Samuel Sr. has been slowed by multiple injuries, and George Kittle is dealing with hamstring irritation. Jennings’ range of outcomes suddenly includes him being a top-12 WR down the stretch.",2024-11-14

Here, fantasy basketball analyst Dan Titus will break down three things fantasy managers need to know each week. Or, he'll break down multiple three-point pieces of advice, analysis and more — it just depends on how open he is From Deep. Today, I'm breaking down three weird fantasy nuggets that have stood out to me as we pass the midway point of Week 4. Many wrote off the Dubs before the season got underway but the Warriors are off to an impressive 9-2 record to begin the year. Much of their success is drawn from their deep roster, composed of youth and overlooked vets who have seemingly bought into Steve Kerr's philosophy of having fluid rotations as long as it's translating to wins. And it is! But the weird part is, for how well this team is playing, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Jonathan Kuminga — no one — is averaging over 30 minutes per game. Even in the load management era, having seven players average at least 20 minutes per game but none exceeding 30 minutes a night is unprecedented. Draymond Green is a top 100 player in 27.5 minutes, while Curry and Buddy Hield make up two-thirds of the non-centers whose production under 30 minutes provides fantasy managers with top 40 or better per-game value. Given Curry's age, it's probably best he's not playing minutes like Kevin Durant (36), who's already on the shelf with a calf injury. Curry's playing the fewest number of minutes since his third NBA season, yet his efficiency and productivity make him one of the top 10 players in fantasy right now. While unconventional in today's game, Kerr's introducing a unique wrinkle to his rotations, allowing his players enough playing time to be effective. He could also be setting up for a possible trade scenario down the line. However the Warriors decide to move, they're a well-oiled machine right now that's getting contributions from nearly everyone up and down the depth chart. The league leader in steals is none other than three-year pro, Dyson Daniels. Daniels moved up to the fifth-shortest odds in the Defensive Player of the Year race, according to BetMGM, when he wasn't even on the list of options to begin the year. He's been a menace on defense, averaging an absurd 7.6 deflections per game on top of converting those deflections into over 3.5 steals per game. Should Daniels keep up with this pace for the rest of the season, he'd be the third player in NBA history to average at least 3.5 steals per game. He's amassed 23 steals over his last four contests, including three consecutive performances with six or more. Daniels is the fourth player in NBA history to swipe six or more steals in three straight games. He's good, but his length, depth and disruption have catapulted him into one of the top perimeter defenders in the league. Daniels went undrafted in 66% of Yahoo leagues and now, thanks to mostly his defense, he's 78th in points leagues and 34th in per-game value in 9-cat leagues. I don't want to discount what Daniels is doing offensively, though. He's increased his scoring from six points to 14 ppg this season and improved his FG percentage to 47% through Thursday. Still, Daniels' leap in fantasy production is driven by his current dominance in a regularly scarce category: steals. As if a three-time MVP, a Finals MVP and one of the best players ever had anything more to accomplish, through 10 games, Jokić is on track to lead the NBA in rebounds and assists per game. No one has done that in league history since Wilt Chamberlain in 1967. When analyzing the Joker's unreal start to the 2024-2025 season, he's putting up the best numbers of his career on a per-minute basis. In fact, Jokić's 1.78 fantasy points per minute is the second-highest rate since 1977. It's no surprise that Jokić is the No. 1 overall player in points leagues (67.73 fantasy points per game) and 9-cat formats. The Nuggets' dependency on Jokić is fantasy gold and despite lackluster play from Jamal Murray, Jokić' is raising the floor for Christian Braun, Michael Porter Jr. and others. Fantasy-wise, he's playing better than Wemby, but it's still very early, and I still believe that Jokić and Wemby will be the top two players in each format.",2024-11-14

Instead, they could host a playoff game due to the will of Marcus Freeman and free-wheeling play of Riley Leonard.","SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Riley Leonard expected the worst. As he entered coach Marcus Freeman’s second-floor office for their standing Sunday sitdown, roughly 24 hours after a stunning home loss against Northern Illinois, Leonard braced himself for bad news. After all, he’d thrown two costly interceptions in a game that seemed to dash all hopes for Notre Dame making the College Football Playoff. Is he going to tell me that I’ll never touch the field again? Was that my last game at Notre Dame? What happened next was a bit weird, wholly unexpected and, for Leonard, one of the most resonating thing he’d ever witnessed. A smiling Freeman embraced his quarterback with a dap, asked about his family and talked pleasantries like the day before never even happened. During their conversation, coach made something clear to quarterback. “In those lowest moments, Riley Leonard had to learn that I believe he is our quarterback,” Freeman recalls during an interview this week from his office. “People might say you are awful and boo you. I as the head coach believe in you. And I need him to believe in me when we’re at the lowest moments. The lowest moments are when you find out who you really are.” Riley left the meeting with no better feeling, he now says — a turning point in the coach-quarterback relationship and, perhaps, the catapult he needed to recover from the first two-pick game of his college career. Two months later, the Irish haven’t lost again. They have won seven straight, six of those by at least two touchdowns and four of those by at least five touchdowns. Leonard is leading Notre Dame in both passing and rushing yards (1,575-609) and passing and rushing touchdowns (9-13). He has thrown fewer interceptions in the last seven games combined (1) than he did in the single game against Northern Illinois. And he’s playing more freely than ever. Why? That 16-14 loss to the Huskies. “I already hit rock-bottom,” Riley told Yahoo Sports this week. “Who cares from this point? I have that mindset of no regrets. Let it fly. Have fun. You only get one shot at this thing. It’s my last year.” Notre Dame’s winning streak has vaulted the Irish (8-1) from playoff impossible to playoff improbable to playoff … probable? The final stretch isn’t the most difficult three-game haul. But it’s not the easiest either. In fact, after hosting 5-4 Virginia this Saturday, Notre Dame plays unbeaten Army at Yankee Stadium before finishing the season in Los Angeles against USC (5-4). According to the playoff selection committee’s latest rankings — the Irish are No. 8 — an 11-1 Notre Dame is undoubtedly in the playoff and may even be in line to host a first-round game as a No. 5-8 seed. Fortune favors the Irish: On the year they lose to Northern Illinois, there is an expanded, 12-team playoff that provides them with enough access room to squeeze into the field. Not only that, but, unlike other teams, Notre Dame would enter the playoff without having played a physically and emotionally grinding game against a top-flight opponent in a conference championship. There is a cost: Notre Dame is ineligible for one of the four first-round byes, which are exclusively reserved for conference champions. The Irish must get an at-large (seed 5-12), a compromise negotiated by former athletic director Jack Swarbrick for ND’s lack of a 13th game. Imagine the Irish hosting in mid-December an SEC juggernaut like Alabama, Texas or Georgia. Or what about an in-state collision with Indiana? It’s conceivable if not even likely. But there is no postseason imagination from Freeman. “Everybody in this program knows we control our own destiny,” he said. “We can daydream all we want about the College Football Playoff, but you’re wasting time.” But let’s waste just a bit more time, shall we? A playoff game against any of those SEC programs would be extra special for Leonard, a kid that grew up along the Alabama coast without having offers from those more regional schools. He eventually signed with Duke, won 16 games as a two-year starter and then transferred here over the offseason. He’s a long way from home and far from the Gulf Coast fishing holes he frequented as a kid. He’s a Southern boy in the Midwest and in one of the most pressure packed positions in the sport: the starting quarterback of Notre Dame. Things were going just fine in that role until the Irish lost as 28-point favorites. Being the Notre Dame starting quarterback wasn’t so fun any longer. “You don’t understand the magnitude of (the position) until something goes bad,” he said. Thankfully, his girlfriend and marketing team operate his social media platforms. He saw none of the hate and vitriol. Instead, his friends and family members saw it all and texted him about it. Don’t look at your comments! They’re all crazy! They’re saying wild stuff — don’t listen! Don’t worry, Leonard would respond, he’s not listening or watching. After all, the critics are just “cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” That’s a line from former president Teddy Roosevelt’s speech on courage that he delivered in Paris in 1910 dubbed “The Man in the Arena.” It’s one of Riley’s favorites. In fact, he has the speech text as lock screen wallpaper on his smartphone. It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena. Leonard views himself as that man, in the arena, the bright lights shining on his golden helmet. Freeman isn’t so different. He’s in the arena too, the face of Notre Dame football, one of the richest and most historic programs in the country, devoid of a national championship for 36 years now. Their positions — head coach at Notre Dame, starting quarterback at Notre Dame — are two of the most enviable and inevitable in the sport. Win and you are showered in adulation; lose and you are the reason why. “That’s the position we are in,” Freeman said. “The lowest moments is when you find out who you really are and what you are made of,” he later said. “If you have too many low moments, guess what? You’re gone. Don’t care if you are the starting quarterback or head coach. You’ve got to be replaced.” If they win the final three games, if they continue their torrid run in the playoff, if they win it all, maybe they’ll point to that low moment as a reason. It’s the pain that drives the Irish. “We use it as motivation every day,” said linebacker Jack Kiser. “Can’t lose that pain. Can’t lose what that feeling is like.” Keep the pain. It’s a slogan that Freeman began using after the loss to the Huskies. The gist: Don’t forget how you felt when you lost. Fear losing. Fear a loss. “People are usually motivated by two things: fear or greed,” Freeman said. “I keep reminding them: You have to keep the pain. There should be fear.” This isn’t Freeman’s first time reviving a team that endured a deflating early season loss. In his first season in 2022, Marshall beat Notre Dame in South Bend. His team followed that by winning eight of the next nine. In fact, that game came up during that Sunday conversation in September between quarterback and coach. Freeman looked at Leonard, “I’ve been in your shoes,” he told him. “I’ve been here before.” Freeman grew so much from that loss to Marshall, he told Leonard. He learned how to be a better coach and a better leader. After the Northern Illinois defeat, the coach spent time examining how this could happen again. Marshall and now Northern Illinois? How? Why? It’s all mental, he says. A week before the Northern Illinois game, the Irish opened the season with an emotional victory at Texas A&M, delivering a win in a hostile and humid environment in Texas. “We weren’t ready to handle success,” he said. Now, more than two months and seven wins later, the Irish are three wins away from a berth in the inaugural 12-team College Football Playoff — with a quarterback and coach who are more connected than ever as the men in the arena. “He had to go through the ups and downs of being the quarterback at Notre Dame to understand what it entails,” Freeman said. “Just like me as a head coach. Someone can tell you what it’s going to be like to be the head coach at Notre Dame, but until you experience it, you don’t know.”",2024-11-14

Florida coach Todd Golden said that Olivier Rioux, a 7-foot-9 freshman who owns a spot in the Guinness record book, is planning to redshirt. Had the popular Canadian played in even one game, he would have burned one of his four seasons of college eligibility. Instead, Rioux will spend the 2024-25 season practicing with teammates and honing his skills — and still be a freshman next fall. “I should have made that clear (before),” Golden said. “Honestly, it’s put him in a tough situation. He’s sitting over there at the end of games and everybody’s yelling at him and trying to get him out there. They just hadn’t understood that that was our potential plan for him. “So that’s where we’re at at this moment. I’m not saying that’s 100% going to be the plan. We’ll continue to talk to him and see if he changes what he wants to do. But as of right now, that’s the plan that we’re going to have with him as we move forward.” Florida students chanted for “Oli” in both of the team’s home games this season. Golden emptied the bench in the final minutes of an 86-62 victory over Grambling State and even said a few words to Rioux during the chaotic scene. “I was just explaining to him, ’Hey, the reason why I’m not putting you in right now is what we’ve talked about a little bit,’” Golden said. “This wasn’t a choice that I made for him. This is something that people (from) our program have talked with him and his family and his parents, his AAU coach and just kind of trying to figure out what the best route for him is. “I just went up to him and I was like, ‘Hey, I’m not trying to be disrespectful with you. I’m just not trying to burn your year putting you in for 30 seconds.’” Rioux handled the decision well, Golden said. “He’s a great kid, and he’s a pleaser,” Golden said. “He wants to do what others think is best for him. And he’s coachable. Again, if this is what our staff, his parents, the people around him that care about him, think is best, I think he’s going to be comfortable. Ultimately, it’s his decision. But I think that’s where he’ll land.”",2024-11-14
"Yahoo!

Dell finds himself in a beneficial matchup this weekend against the Cowboys. Believe it or not, Dallas allows the second most receiving yards per play this season according to NFL Pro. This is a bottom-10 Cowboys secondary and in four similar matchups against bottom-10 secondaries this season, Dell averages 14.9 fantasy points per game. Now Nico Collins is trending to play in Week 11. This should, and likely will, lower the target share of Dell in Week 11. But I don’t expect it to be too detrimental for him. He averaged 14.6 points in 10 games with Collins last season and often outproduced Collins on a weekly basis in 2023. The volume might drop this week but expect less defensive attention to go Dell’s way with Collins back in the lineup. Continue to start Dell; he’s a top-24 receiver this week. Hopkins is coming off a down week against the Broncos where he produced just 56 scoreless yards on four receptions. This was a big dropoff from his Week 9 breakout performance of 86 yards and two touchdowns against the Bucs. But don’t be too concerned by this Week 10 dud. Hopkins was facing a strong Denver secondary led by standout cornerback Patrick Surtain II. Hopkins plays most of his snaps on the outside, which is primarily where Surtain lines up. Expect a bounce-back performance for Hopkins this week. He’ll take on the Bills, who rank 22nd in coverage this season according to PFF. Buffalo allowed 70+ receiving yards to three different Colts receivers last week. Hopkins should become a priority target once again for Patrick Mahomes this week in a softer matchup. Start Hopkins with confidence in Week 11. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Jennings is coming off one of the best games of his career. In Week 10, Jennings played the Brandon Aiyuk role in the 49ers offense for the first time this season. This resulted in a nine-catch game for 93 yards on a team-high 11 targets. Jennings looked great on film, winning often at the line of scrimmage and downfield. He was operating as the 49ers' true No. 1 receiver in this game, ahead of Deebo Samuel. This week Jennings finds himself in a beneficial matchup against the Seahawks. Now, he produced just three catches for 27 yards against the Seahawks in Week 6, but he was playing a different role in that game with Brandon Aiyuk active. Expect Jennings to continue to operate as the 49ers' X receiver on the outside, an important role in the Kyle Shanahan-led offense. Seattle has been below average in coverage this season according to PFF, ranking 17th in total team coverage. Fire up Jennings in your lineups this week. Tillman exits his bye week and walks into a strong matchup. He’ll take on a Saints secondary that no longer has star cornerback Marshon Lattimore on their roster. New Orleans allowed 306 passing yards to Kirk Cousins and the Falcons last week in their first game without Lattimore. Both Drake London and Darnell Mooney topped 90 receiving yards in this contest. Now, it’s Jameis Winston’s turn to attack this secondary. Tillman comes into this strong Week 11 matchup red-hot. He’s earned at least 16 fantasy points in three straight games and has averaged 10 targets per game with Winston as his QB. Tillman leads the Browns with a 24% target share since Amari Cooper was traded to the Bills. He has a great combination of size at 213 pounds and speed that has paired well with Winston in the past. Tillman is a weekly must-start in any matchup moving forward but especially this week against a compromised Saints secondary. Williams returned from his suspension in Week 10 and produced three catches for 53 yards. This performance wasn’t anything too exciting, but he did quietly earn a 22% target share in this game which was his best usage in a game since Week 2. The result was just 6.8 fantasy points, but the usage was encouraging in his first game back against a top 10 Texans secondary. This week Williams gets a much better matchup in the Jaguars. Jacksonville allows a whopping 7.2 receiving yards per play, the most in the league according to NFL Pro. The Jaguars allow plenty of explosive plays on defense this season, which is a great setup for Williams' skill set. Despite missing the past two games, Williams still ranks top 10 in explosive plays this season according to Player Profiler. This matchup sets up nicely for Williams to create one to two big plays. You can FLEX him this week.",2024-11-14
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",What to watch: Week 12 college football viewing guide,https://sports.yahoo.com/what-to-watch-week-12-college-football-viewing-guide-142838162.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 14:28:38 GMT",There are two games between ranked opponents in Week 12 and both of those games are in the SEC.,"We've hit the home stretch of the 2024 college football regular season. There are just three weeks to go before conference championship week in the first week of December. Week 13 isn't the most loaded slate, but it does feature two games between ranked opponents and games all over the country that have implications in conference title races. And once again, those ranked games are in the SEC. The marquee game of the week is in Athens, Ga., as the Bulldogs play for their College Football Playoff life against Tennessee. Missouri, meanwhile, tries to keep its CFP flame flickering as a two-score underdog against a South Carolina team that beat Texas A&M two weeks ago. Here's what to watch in Week 13. All times are Eastern and all odds are from BetMGM. Time: Noon | TV: Fox | Line: Colorado -11.5 | Total: 46.5 The Buffaloes’ path to the playoff is clear. Colorado will get a first-round bye in the College Football Playoff if it wins its final four games. Entering the season, we figured that this game could have playoff impacts but that those impacts would be limited to Utah. Instead, it’s been an injury-filled nightmare season for the Utes again as they’re down to two healthy quarterbacks and lost TE Brant Kuithe to a season-ending injury against BYU in Week 11. QB Brandon Rose made his first career start in the controversial loss to the Cougars and suffered a lower leg injury on the final possession. Freshman Isaac Wilson will take back over as Utah’s starter. He’s appeared in seven games so far this season. Colorado’s defense should be up to the task of slowing down the depleted Utah offense. Though Shedeur Sanders’ passing prowess and Travis Hunter’s two-way exploits get a lot of Colorado’s headlines, the Buffs’ defensive improvement is the biggest reason why they are in Big 12 contention. Teams are averaging just 217 passing yards per game against Colorado and 5.3 yards per play. That’s a full 60 yards per game and one yard per play fewer than 2023. Time: 4:15 p.m. | TV: SEC Network | Line: South Carolina -12.5 | Total: 44.5 Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz was technically correct when he said his team was in the playoff hunt following its wild win over Oklahoma. Yes, this Mizzou team has been blown out at Texas A&M and Alabama, but it’ll get serious consideration for the postseason if it finishes the regular season at 10-2. That task looks a lot more difficult than it appeared at the beginning of the season. QB Brady Cook is listed as doubtful for Saturday’s game with ankle and wrist injuries. Cook injured his ankle against Auburn and then hurt his wrist against Alabama. He missed the win over OU as Drew Pyne started in his place. The offense hasn’t been nearly as good with Pyne at QB instead of Cook, but he led the Tigers on two TD drives in the fourth quarter. The Tigers only have a chance if Pyne plays like that during the entire game. South Carolina has won three straight games after its two-point loss to Alabama. That includes a 44-20 win over Texas A&M. Given the way the Gamecocks played against both the teams that dominated Mizzou, you can understand why the Gamecocks are significant favorites. Especially with the way LaNorris Sellers is playing. He’s accounted for five TDs and nearly 500 passing yards over the last two games and hasn’t thrown an interception. Time: 7:30 p.m. | TV: NBC | Line: Oregon -14 | Total: 52.5 Is this the toughest game remaining on the Ducks’ regular-season schedule? Oregon is off in Week 13 before a home game against Washington to end the season. A win in just one of those games also gets Oregon in the Big Ten title game even though the Ducks are tied atop the conference with Indiana and just a game ahead of Ohio State and Penn State. We won’t get knee-deep into the tiebreakers here, but if Oregon wins Saturday night it will likely play the winner of next week’s Indiana vs. Ohio State game in the Big Ten title game in Indianapolis. And since Oregon is off, it will get to watch that game very closely. Ducks QB Dillon Gabriel’s chase of Bo Nix’s completion percentage record is likely going to be futile, though he could end up getting the Heisman at the end of the season. Gabriel is responsible for 28 touchdowns and will surpass 3,000 passing yards for the season if he throws for 153 yards Saturday night. Wisconsin enters the game on a two-game losing streak following three consecutive wins. The Badgers fell 28-13 at Penn State on Oct. 26 and were blown out 42-10 at Iowa on Nov. 2. Wisconsin is averaging just 25 points per game in 2024 as Tyler Van Dyke is out for the season with a knee injury. Time: 7:30 p.m. | TV: ABC | Line: Georgia -10.5 | Total: 48.5 Will Nico Iamaleava be healthy enough to play on Saturday? The Tennessee QB is reportedly in concussion protocol after he left Tennessee’s Week 11 game against Mississippi State at halftime. He’s officially listed as questionable on the SEC injury report. If Iamaleava can’t go, it’s hard to see how Tennessee has much of a chance against the Bulldogs. The Tennessee offense hasn’t lived up to its lofty expectations with him under center, and asking Gaston Moore to go on the road in Athens and win his first start may be a bridge too far. The Vols are in the top 10 despite an offense that’s been sluggish because of a phenomenal defense. Tennessee has one of the best defensive lines in the country and will look to give Georgia fits like Ole Miss did in Week 11. James Pearce Jr. leads the team with 5.5 sacks and is an All-American candidate. Georgia is out of the College Football Playoff mix with a loss; the Vols’ visit on Saturday night gave the committee an easy out with its placement of the Bulldogs on Tuesday. If Georgia wins, the Bulldogs are back in the provisional bracket after Week 12. If Tennessee pulls the upset, then Georgia won’t be considered for the playoff the rest of the season. A loss seems farfetched to us. Just look at how Kirby Smart motivated his team ahead of the Texas game. A No. 12 ranking can provide a lot of motivation. Time: 10:15 p.m. | TV: ESPN | Line: BYU -3 | Total: 56.5 Yes, your eyes aren’t fooling you. The undefeated top-10 BYU Cougars are favored by just a field goal at home against a team that has a losing record. You can understand why oddsmakers are hedging against BYU. The Cougars have escaped twice over the last three games with late scores. Overall, four of BYU’s nine wins have come by a single possession and three of those wins are by three or fewer points. Even if the Cougars win on Saturday, don’t be surprised if they’re underdogs at Arizona State in Week 13. Kansas took down Iowa State 45-36 in Week 11 and has won two of its last three games. The Jayhawks were among the preseason favorites for the Big 12 title, but have been the masters of the one-score loss. Five of Kansas’ six defeats have come by six points or fewer. That includes a two-point loss at Kansas State, a four-point loss at Arizona State and a four-point loss at West Virginia. Jayhawks QB Jalon Daniels has thrown for at least one TD and rushed for a score in each of KU’s last four games. Against ISU, the 2023 preseason Big 12 offensive player of the year threw for 295 yards and two scores and rushed for 68 yards and a score. BYU will need to contain him to get the win. No. 3 Texas at Arkansas (Noon, ABC): These two old Southwest Conference rivals meet for the first time as members of the same conference since 1991. The Longhorns are significant favorites, but we’re not sure of anything with this Arkansas team. Don’t be surprised if the game is close, at least for the first half with both QB Taylen Green and RB Ja’Quinden Jackson listed as probable. No. 20 Clemson at Pitt (Noon, ESPN): This game lost a lot of luster with Pitt’s loss to Virginia in Week 11. Clemson still has a decent chance at the ACC title but needs some help. That chance disappears with a loss to the Panthers, who need QB Eli Holstein back on the field. He left the loss to the Cavaliers in the second half with an apparent head injury and coach Pat Narduzzi said Thursday that Holstein will be a game-time decision. Boston College at No. 14 SMU (3:30 p.m., ESPN): The Mustangs’ manageable road to the ACC title game begins with the Eagles at home. SMU has BC, Virginia and Cal over the final three weeks of the season. Boston College will be starting Grayson James at QB after he took over for Thomas Castellanos in Week 11. Castellanos won’t travel with the team to Dallas and is reportedly weighing a transfer. Arizona State at No. 16 Kansas State (7 p.m., ESPN): Don’t overlook either of these teams in the race to the Big 12 title game. Both ASU and KSU are tied for third entering Week 12. Kansas State has the head-to-head tiebreaker over Colorado and Arizona State hosts BYU next week. ASU RB Cam Skattebo looks set to play after missing the Sun Devils’ Week 10 win over UCF.",2024-11-14

However, time is always part of the story now with LeBron James — those three consecutive triple-doubles set a record for the oldest player ever to accomplish that feat, doing it at age 39. That broke LeBron's old record set at age 34. Next month, LeBron will turn 40, so the question of how much longer he can do this — or how much longer he wants to do it — came up. ""It's the mind,"" LeBron said about what will determine when he hangs up his Nikes. ""Wherever my mind is, is how the rest of my body is going to go, whatever the case may be. I'm not going to play that much longer, to be completely honest. One year, two years, whatever the case may be. I said the other night that I'm not playing until the wheels fall off. I'm not. ""I'm not going to be that guy. I'm not going to be the guy disrespecting the game because I just want to be out on the floor."" LeBron echoes what he has said previously, and what the handful of great athletes who get to choose when they exit the game have long said (most professional athletes have that choice to walk away made for them when teams don't give them another contract despite the player wanting to continue). It's not the body — especially in LeBron's case when he has taken such exceptional care of his — it's when the player no longer has the desire to put in the work needed to get their body ready to play. It's not that said player doesn't want to keep playing, but he doesn't want to do what has to be done to continue to play at that level. LeBron will get to the end of this season, whenever that is for the Lakers, sit back and reflect, then make his call. Does he want to do this for season 23? The Lakers will gladly pay him if he wants to return. The question is, when does his mind tell him it doesn't want to anymore? LeBron doesn't know when that will be, but he senses it's coming.",2024-11-14
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Pros and Cons: Should Mets sign Walker Buehler?,https://sports.yahoo.com/pros-cons-mets-sign-walker-140002932.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 14:00:02 GMT",Should the Mets sign free agent pitcher Walker Buehler? Here are the pros and cons...,"One of the things at the top of the list for the Mets this offseason will be rebuilding a rotation that could be losing three core members from the 2024 group. They've extended one-year, qualifying offers to free agents Sean Manaea and Luis Severino, and Jose Quintana is also a free agent. Manaea will almost certainly reject the QO and hit the free agent market. Regarding Severino, the possibility exists that he could accept the QO, which would bring him back to the Mets for 2025. As things currently stand, the Mets' rotation ahead of 2025 consists of Kodai Senga (who should be healthy after a 2024 that was lost to multiple injuries) and David Peterson, with depth options that include Paul Blackburn (assuming he's offered arbitration), Jose Butto, and Tylor Megill. There are a handful of ace-level starting pitchers on the free agent market -- Corbin Burnes, Max Fried, and Blake Snell. Also available is 23-year-old Japanese ace Roki Sasaki, whose age and years of service in Japan will limit him to a minor league deal, with interested teams able to only offer their international bonus pool money to him. Pretty much every team will be after him. Then there's the trade market, with White Sox ace Garrett Crochet at the top of it. But there's also a way for the Mets to seriously improve their rotation without signing one of the biggest names or swinging a trade for someone like Crochet. They did that last offseason, when they signed Severino and Manaea. The Mets correctly identified that Severino was likely to bounce back after a lost 2023 with the Yankees, and their belief in that paid off. As far as Manaea, the Mets took a chance on him and then watched him pitch like an ace down the stretch in 2024 after he dropped his arm angle. Now, the 2025 version of Severino and Manaea could be staring them in the face. Enter Walker Buehler? Buehler is the only pitcher available this offseason via free agency who has legitimate ace potential, but who almost certainly won't require a long-term deal. The guess here is that Burnes will get around seven years, Fried six years, and Snell three or four. All three of those pitchers could get average annual values that exceed $30 million. As far as Buehler, it seems likely that he'll ink a one- or two-year deal (potentially with the second year being a player option) in order to build his value back up following Tommy John surgery and a difficult regular season in 2024. Another plus regarding Buehler is that the Dodgers did not extend a qualifying offer to him, which means any team that signs him will not lose a draft pick for doing so. When Buehler is right, he is a No. 1 starter. From 2018 to 2021 he had a 2.82 ERA (3.16 FIP) and 0.98 WHIP while striking out 620 batters in 564.0 innings -- a strikeout rate a tick under 10.0 per nine. And while Buehler struggled this past season during what was his first year back after having Tommy John surgery in August of 2022 (his second TJS, after also having the procedure in 2015), there are reasons to believe he'll be able to return to form in 2025 as he enters his age-30 season. Buehler's struggles during the 2024 regular season were deep, as he posted a 5.38 ERA (5.54 FIP) and 1.55 WHIP in 16 starts over 75.1 innings while striking out 64 -- a career-low 7.6 per nine. A closer look shows that Buehler's stuff graded out near the bottom of the league. Meanwhile, many of his advanced stats (including xERA, xBA, chase rate, and whiff rate) were among the worst in baseball. Buehler's four-seam fastball and sinker also saw modest velocity dips between his last fully healthy season (2021) and 2024, but those drops weren't alarming. His average four-seam velocity in 2021 was 95.3 mph, while it was 95.0 mph in 2024. Also of note is that Buehler relied a lot less on his four-seamer in 2024 than he did earlier in his career. And hitters tagged it this past season, batting .342 with a .696 slugging percentage against the offering. It's common for pitchers in their first year back from Tommy John surgery to struggle, so it should not be surprising that Buehler's regular season in 2024 was a slog. But it was alarmingly bad at times. Another thing to consider is how many innings Buehler might be limited to in 2025. He pitched just 90.1 innings in 2024 between the regular season and postseason, meaning it's unreasonable to believe he'll have a regular workload this coming season. As the Dodgers' playoff run went on, Buehler started to resemble the best version of himself, culminating with 4.0 shutout innings against the Mets in the NLCS and 6.0 scoreless innings against the Yankees in the World Series. In those two series, he allowed just five hits, walked four, and struck out 13. If Buehler finds his form, he could be the steal of the offseason. And if he doesn't, the commitment will likely be so short that it wouldn't matter much. He should be near the top of the Mets' offseason wish list.",2024-11-14

Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Sinner and Fritz progress at ATP Finals,https://sports.yahoo.com/fritz-beats-minaur-boost-last-160404958.html,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 22:38:54 GMT",World number one Jannik Sinner and Taylor Fritz are through to the last four at the ATP Finals in Turin.,"World number one Jannik Sinner continued his perfect start at the ATP Finals with a dominant win over Russian Daniil Medvedev. Playing on home soil in Turin, Sinner won 6-3 6-4 to top the Ilie Nastase group with three wins from three. Sinner's place in the semi-finals had earlier been confirmed by Taylor Fritz's 5-7 6-4 6-3 defeat of Alex de Minaur. He returned the favour by seeing off Medvedev, with the Russian needing to beat Sinner in straight sets if he was to qualify ahead of American Fritz. Sinner and Fritz will discover their semi-final opponents on Friday with Carlos Alcaraz, Alexander Zverev, Casper Ruud and Andrey Rublev still able to qualify. ""No preference [on who I play]. Whoever it is going to be on the other side of the net I will try to play the best tennis I can,"" Sinner told Sky Sports. Top seed Sinner has yet to drop a set in Turin as he seeks an impressive end to a year in which he has won his first two Grand Slam titles, but also been embroiled in an ongoing doping controversy. ""I'm here, I know what I have achieved during this year so I try to step on court with a good mindset,"" Sinner said in his on-court interview. ""I have a good team around me. I have beautiful people around me who support me daily and wish for me."" The Australian and US Open champion dropped just two points on serve during the first set as Medvedev was undone by 17 unforced errors. Sinner broke for a 5-3 lead before serving out the opener and carried his momentum into the second, striking first again. Medvedev responded to move level at 3-3, but more unforced errors proved costly for the fourth seed and Sinner took advantage to break at 4-4, much to the delight of the partisan crowd. A winner of seven ATP Tour titles in 2024, the Italian calmly served out the match for his 68th win from 74 matches. ""I'm here trying to find new ways to improve as a player. I'm here trying to win as many as matches as I can,"" Sinner added. 'Sinnermania' continues in Italy despite doping controversy Watch GB v Germany in BJK Cup Finals live on BBC Earlier on Thursday, Australia's De Minaur needed to defeat fifth seed Fritz in straight sets for any chance of progressing to the semi-finals in Turin. However, his hopes were crushed when Fritz stole the second set against the run of play. The US Open finalist had to wait to learn his last four fate, which was confirmed when Medvedev conceded the opening set to Sinner. ""All of us are pretty beat up but if I'm in the semi-finals of the world tour finals then I've got energy to give,"" said Fritz after his win. Seventh seed De Minaur, although labouring through his opening service games, was the first to break when he ended a superb rally with a clever cross-court winner for a 4-3 lead. Fritz was quick to respond, levelling in the next game before De Minaur broke again and served out the opening set as his opponent became increasingly frustrated, complaining to the umpire about flash photography in the arena. The US Open runner-up had to fend off two break points in the second set, while De Minaur, in comparison, looked comfortable on serve with three love holds. That was until Fritz increased his intensity and seized his opportunity at 5-4 to end De Minaur's season. With his tournament essentially over, De Minaur continued to falter as Fritz surged and he wrapped up the victory with an ace after two hours and eight minutes. ""He was all over me. What I did a great job of was towards the end of the second set I started to find my serve, I started serving much better,"" Fritz said. ""It just gave me a little bit of comfort to stay in the match and not be under so much pressure. It was still incredibly tough."" Meanwhile, Britain's Henry Patten and his partner Harri Heliovaara of Finland made it three wins from three in the doubles group stage. The pair, who won Wimbledon together in July, fought back to win 4-6 6-3 12-10 against 2020 champions Nikola Mektic and Wesley Koolhof, who was playing his last ATP Tour match. Patten and Heliovaara had already secured their place in the semi-finals and will learn their last-four opponents on Friday.

Aaron Rodgers, who claimed he wasn't aware of the ""Red Line"" hashtag Williams applied to a celebratory post on Instagram, laughed it off when asked about it on Wednesday by reporters. Does Rodgers have a response to Williams? ""I don't have one,"" Rodgers said, chuckling. ""I like Mike. I'm happy for Mike."" Rodgers publicly criticized Williams for running the wrong route on the play that became in game-sealing interception in a Monday night loss to the Bills last month. Rodgers said Williams should have been on the ""red line"" that runs (on a practice field) five yards from the sideline. When Williams wasn't where he was supposed to be, Rodgers adjusted the throw and the pass was picked off. Quarterbacks in the vast majority of situations don't blame receivers in public for incompletions or interceptions, even when it's their fault. Rodgers, who later claimed he was simply answering a question, broke that unwritten rule. Williams was clearly still thinking about it, even after he was traded to Pittsburgh. And Williams has every reason to. Rodgers could have simply said it was a miscommunication. Instead, he specifically placed the blame on Williams. It's no surprise. Rodgers attaches heavy importance on his obscenely impressive touchdown-to-interception ratio, since gaudy stats like that help support the argument that he's one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, despite having only one Super Bowl appearance and one Super Bowl win. Williams is now playing with a quarterback who has two Super Bowl appearances. And Russell Wilson has never complained, publicly or privately, about a teammate. Even if he could have taken the position that the interception that cost him a second ring should be blamed on receiver Jermaine Kearse, for failing to execute the pick/rub on Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler that would have allowed receiver Ricardo Lockette to catch the championship-winning touchdown pass.",2024-11-14

Gruden has signed a multi-year deal with Barstool Sports. The Super Bowl XXXVII-winning coach of the Buccaneers was traded to Tampa by the Raiders before the 2002 season. He joined ESPN after being fired by the Bucs in early 2009. Gruden returned to the Raiders in 2018. In 2021, he was essentially forced to resign by the selective leaking of supposedly confidential emails harvested in the Washington investigation. Yes, the outcome was unavoidable given the contents of the emails. No, that doesn't make the seemingly deliberate effort to take him out during a season right. A lawsuit against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell was quickly filed. More than three years later, it remains stuck on the question of whether the litigation should unfold in open court or in the NFL's secret, rigged, kangaroo court of arbitration. Recently, Gruden secured a rehearing of the matter before the full Nevada Supreme Court. If he prevails on the issue, the NFL undoubtedly will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, further delaying the case. Barstool occupies a separate spot on the NFL's unofficial shit list. Founder Dave Portnoy and others conducted a sit-in at the lobby of the league office after Tom Brady was suspended for #DeflateGate. The NFL has since tried (at times successfully) to keep Barstool Sports personalities out of NFL events. Earlier this year, Gruden launched a YouTube channel. It has done well. He's entertaining and informative. Just like his lawsuit will be, if (as we hope) it ends up playing out in court.",2024-11-14

A catastrophic, interception-laden first half for QB Carson Beck led to their first defeat at the hands of Alabama in Week 4. Fortunately, the Dawgs bounced back to extinguish Texas in Austin 30-15, despite another three-interception performance by QB Carson Beck. Two weeks ago, they overcame a first half scare from Florida for a 34-20 victory, which was a harbinger for last week’s embarrassing 28-10 loss to @Ole Miss. Their offense lacks explosion, ranking 99th in yards per successful rush (8.9 yards) and 73rd in yards per successful dropback (14.6 yards), and has committed 15 turnovers with a 3.6% interception rate (102nd). A loss to Tennessee would sink UGA’s CFP Playoff hopes, so they hope to have injured RB Trevor Etienne back up to speed after being limited the last two games. Tennessee (8-1) obliterated their first three non-conference opponents by a combined score of 191-13. That is not a misprint. Their lone misstep occurred in Week 4 when @Arkansas backup QB Malachi Singleton ran for an 11-yard touchdown with 1:11 remaining in the game to outlast UT 19-17. They churned out a pair of one-score wins over Florida and most notably Alabama, which has been their signature win to this point. Tennessee’s offense has cleared 28 points just once in SEC play, ranking 23rd in EPA/rush and 45th in EPA/dropback. Defensively they rank 3rd overall in SP+ and boast arguably the best run D in the nation, averaging a 28% stuff rate (2nd) and 33.6% rushing success rate (4th).

The latest odds as of Thursday: Moneyline: Georgia (-375), Tennessee (+300) Spread: Georgia -10.5 Over/Under: 48.5 points The Georgia line opened at a massive Georgia -17.5, but that has dramatically readjusted to the current -10.5 with unsubstantiated reports of Tennessee QB Nico Iamaleava allegedly being on track to play. Best prices for the Moneyline are -360 for UGA and +335 for the Vols. The game total has ticked down from the 49 open to a low of 47.5 at time of publishing. NBC Sports Betting Analyst Eric Froton (@CFFroton) thinks:“Georgia is 6-3 to the Under so far this year and has failed to clear the 48.5 points mark against Ole Miss, Texas, Auburn, Kentucky and Clemson. The only competitive game that went under was the Carson Beck first half meltdown against Alabama. Tennessee has gone Under 48.5 points in every SEC game so far, so I'm going to listen to the trends and play the UNDER 48.5 game total. ” Listen to the Bet the Edge podcast as hosts Jay Croucher and Drew Dinsick provide listeners with sharp actionable insight, market analysis and statistical data to help bettors gain more information before placing their wagers. Georgia: Heading into the season QB Carson Beck led all returning FBS signal callers with 3,949 passing yards and a 2nd ranked 91.5 PFF offensive grade. He emerged as a Heisman front-runner who opened at 4-to-1 odds to win college football’s most coveted prize, but the quality of his play has cratered with Beck throwing nine interceptions in the last four games. His 76th% PFF offensive grade and 12 interceptions are concerning, as is Beck’s dirt-low 28th% passing grade under pressure with a 35% completion rate. Tennessee: QB Nico Iamaleava arrived on campus last year as a ballyhooed five-star recruit with a premium athletic profile. After serving a one-year apprenticeship, he has completed 65% of his throws for 1,880 yards and an 11-to-4 ratio as UT’s starting quarterback. While his 82nd% passing grade is a very credible mark, HC Josh Heupel has protected Nico by having him attempt 30+ passes just once this season. Iamaleava’s 11.7 yards per attempt ranks third nationally, proving that he isn’t afraid to be aggressive and take shots down the field. Unfortunately, Iamaleava is questionable to play due to a concussion sustained last weekend against Mississippi State. Fifth-year QB Gaston Moore would draw the start in his absence. Georgia's offense has thrown for 2,578 passing yards in 9 games this season, tied for 16th-best among FBS offenses. Tennessee's defense has allowed just 171.6 passing yards per game this season, which ranks 15th-best among FBS defenses. Georgia’s offensive line ranks 2nd in the nation with a 20.9% pressure rate allowed and 8th with a 3.8% blown run block rate. However, they also rank 94th allowing a 22.7% sacks-per-pressure rate and 3.9 penalties a game, which ranks 79th overall. Tennessee has tackled opponents for a loss on 68-of-322 rushing attempts this year, good for a 21% TFL rate that ranks 2nd-best in the SEC. Ole Miss leads the conference at 26.5%. Despite HC Heupel’s reputation for building high-flying offenses, UT is running the ball at well above average rates on both standard downs (63.4% = 30th) and passing downs (49.2% = 7th).

	This year's NBA City Edition unis were officially unveiled on Thursday, so we're ranking them from 30 to 1.","The NBA and Nike officially unveiled the 2024-25 City Edition uniforms for all 30 teams on Thursday, and while the designs have been leaked since this summer, I like to wait until we get the official images to rank them. That is because the actual jerseys themselves almost always look better than their 2D mock-ups, which is certainly the case with this year’s crop. The leaks got roasted to no end on social media and while I’m not crazy about this year’s group of uniforms, they aren’t as bad in actuality as the leaks looked.  That said, there are some heaters and some really bad ones, along with a big crop this year of very “meh” looks as it’s fair to wonder if Nike and the teams are running a bit short on ideas — good news guys, at least another 12 years of these! Here we are ranking the uniforms from worst to best, where there’s one that should become part of one team’s permanent look.  NBA
Creating good alternates is hard when you have an iconic jersey set, and that’s the problem the Celtics (and Lakers) run into every year. These are just bad and don’t even seem to be trying to do anything interesting. Wear your normal (and great) uniforms, please.  NBA
Same goes for the Lakers. These are just unbecoming of a once proud franchise.  NBA
I’m honestly kind of stunned they went back to the Heat Culture well again after the reaction to when they did this last year, but it does look a little better on the all red uniform. Still, c’mon guys, stop trying to make this a thing. NBA
On the opposite end of the spectrum from Boston and L.A. is OKC, which has had one uniform in its history that I thought was legitimately good (the 2018 City Edition honoring Oklahoma’s Native American heritage). Everything else has been either “meh” or outright bad. I’ll say this, these aren’t the worst unis they’ve ever had, but I just am not a fan.  NBA
The Pacers have done this look before in black, and it’s just not for me.  NBA
A retro look that just doesn’t really land for me. I will say, I bet the court they have for this color scheme will look great, but I’m just not a big fan of the lettering.  NBA
I wouldn’t call these bad, they just don’t land for me, but that’s also been the case for a number of the Brooklyn City Editions over the years.  NBA
I’m just out on the 5280 thing. I like the mountains on the side and the topographical map thing, and while I think there are better executions, leaning into the rainbow coloring is generally good for Denver. However, I just can’t get on board with the 5280 in place of lettering. NBA
All of the uniforms in this tier have the same issue of not being bad, but also not being particularly inspiring. Dallas’ are particularly plain, which, again, not necessarily bad, but not memorable either.  NBA
I get they’re going for the Chicago musical font here, but it feels like they weren’t willing to go all-in on it and the end result is pretty bland.  NBA
I get what Minnesota’s going for, but I just see an old Windows 98 screensaver in that design.  NBA
They aren’t as bad as the Lakers and Celtics, but they also have a similar problem where their normal uniforms are iconic classics and trying something new often just makes you want them to do what they always do.  NBA
The Magic are at the top of this group by virtue of having the best lettering/logo — the Magic with a star for the A is always great — but Orlando has great uniform looks and this one just falls flat comparatively.  NBA
Like Orlando, Charlotte has some great throwback looks and this just makes me wish they were wearing one of those instead.  NBA
My colleague Mark said the logo looks like it should be for store brand paper towels and I can’t unsee it. I do like that shade of blue though.  NBA
Perfectly fine, even though it’s still a little confusing when the Bucks are wearing all-blue.  NBA
Never seen a more Oklahoma State jersey in my life. Go Pokes.  NBA
I actually kinda like these, but they are giving off strong vibes of made up Houston jerseys for a movie that couldn’t afford NBA licensing.  NBA
If I were to guess, these will be among the most polarizing unis. I dig New Orleans leaning into being a little different and weird, and the herringbone pattern with actual bones certainly does that. They will likely be at the bottom of some folks rankings but I don’t think their standard unis are so good that they can’t get weird and have it work.  NBA
These have grown on me a bit, in part because they at least look like Warriors uniforms — unlike their Michigan/Marquette alternates from a year or two ago. They aren’t the best uniforms in the world, but a solid attempt at playing off something unique to the Bay (the Golden Gate Bridge).  NBA
I really like the District font and this year they put it on a nice color instead of whatever the hell the black and green and orange thing was a year ago. The Wizards won’t be good this year, but I do think they’ll look good in these.  NBA
I like this Spurs font, they’ve done it before but it works for me. I also like this shade of blue. These aren’t as good as their fiesta look in the past, but a solid choice and I just like when the Spurs have a little pop of color.  NBA
I like these, even though I will not immediately spot this color and go “Cavs” in my brain. Part of why these will work is their court that goes with them is phenomenal.  NBA
Another one that gets a big boost from an unbelievably good court design. These play off the old 1995 All-Star logo, and while I’m not crazy about the font, I still dig them. If they incorporated the saguaro cactus into them, they’d be higher.  NBA
The Blazers almost always do a good job with the City edition uni, and this year is another good addition to their rotation. A big part of that is their “Rip City” font just looks good on anything. NBA
The Jazz are finally making the move back to the purple mountains with their full-time uniform set, and this year’s City Edition is a very good version of that.  NBA
The throwback to the Memphis Sounds just looks fantastic. I love that Memphis font and these are going to look fantastic on the floor — even if it’ll take a little adjustment to seeing a team in red and thinking “Grizzlies”.  NBA
The Kings also have another really good throwback look, taking it to the days of the Cincinnati Royals. The royal blue and red just pops, and they didn’t try to do too much with a uniform that doesn’t need much more.  NBA
I’m a sucker for this spectrum Sixers look. I just think it’s so clean and the white edition is even better than the navy look from a couple years back.  NBA
The Vince Carter Raptor doing his legendary between-the-legs dunk is so good and the Raptors need to just make it their permanent logo. These with the purple retro look they brought back this year is a damn-near perfect uniform set and it’s a shame they will move on to something new next season.",2024-11-14

Washington has been an “over” team to the tune of 7-3 this season, but Philadelphia has been quietly stout on defense in recent weeks. This is, of course, a short week for both teams, and Washington has some injury issues along its offensive line. I tend to think the Commanders defense is a touch undervalued in this spot as well, and this is a favorable price. The Saints got the bounce last week after firing their coach and, with the help of one of the worst kicking performances of the season for Atlanta, New Orleans won a game it shouldn’t have won. That could benefit us this week, as the Browns are underdogs in a spot where they probably shouldn’t be. Let’s ride the Jameis roller coaster and hope it goes well. Detroit is a wagon. They seemingly cover every week and, when they don’t like in Week 10, they somehow win the game despite a million turnovers. With that said, getting a full 14 here on Jacksonville is something I can’t pass on. Trust me, I know how ugly it is. Seattle is healthier and coming off a bye, including the projected return of DK Metcalf. I’ve also been a touch low on San Francisco all season, and I simply can’t get this to 6.5 points, even with McCaffrey back for the 49ers. This teaser happens to involve a pair of prime time games, but I would like it even if it didn’t. Candidly, I love each leg here, with the Bengals more than able to get in the backdoor if things go south at the outset. Houston is on the road, which does scare me a bit, but the situation in Dallas is rather dire, and the Texans may be discounted a bit after a maddening loss to Detroit.",2024-11-14

	Giannis got called for a foul despite getting all ball. But fortunately for the Bucks, as Rasheed Wallace once said, ball don't lie.","The Milwaukee Bucks played host to the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night, and while there is still a ton of basketball left to be played this season, you won’t find a more insane final 90 or so seconds of regulation than what we got out of these two Central Division opponents. The two teams traded the lead back and forth, and after a Marcus Sasser three tied things up with just under 30 seconds left, Milwaukee got the ball and had a chance to win. A wide open look by Taurean Prince did not fall, and with a hair over a second left on the clock, Detroit called a timeout, advanced the ball, and tried to replicate the magic it found on a sideline out of bounds play on Tuesday night against Miami. It looked like that was going to happen, as Cade Cunningham lobbed one up to Ron Holland near the rim, but Giannis Antetokounmpo was able to break things up … well, at least it looked like he did, but the referees called a foul that stood after a review even though it really did not look like Giannis fouled Holland at all. However, in the words of the great philosopher Rasheed Wallace, ball don’t lie. Holland stepped up to the charity stripe and missed short twice, which ended up sending the game to overtime. It would’ve been an awfully harsh way for the game to end for Milwaukee, but, again, Sheed’s got us covered here.",2024-11-14

Former NBA stars Carmelo Anthony and Rudy Gay recently chimed in on the recent back and forth between Drake and DeMar DeRozan, which was a byproduct of the 6 God’s feud with Kendrick Lamar earlier this year. 
	“I think Drake was hurt a little bit because of the relationship he built with DeMar in Toronto,” Melo said on an episode of his show 7PM In Brooklyn. “Representing the 6, Raptors — you know that was a lot of connection with those two. He’s a Raptor for life from a basketball standpoint. Yes, that jersey should be going up.” 

	








 
	Gay, who just recently retired from the NBA, previously played for the Raptors, and is a new recurring co-host on 7PM, disapproved of Drizzy’s behavior. “That’s wack, man. Drake is wack for that,” he asserted. “You gotta pull up on DeMar if you feel that way before you go on camera.” Melo agreed, especially regarding the Toronto rapper’s comments on taking down DeRozan’s banner if the Raptors ever hung one up for him.

	“Drake did a lot when he said I’ma go up there and take it down. That part is a lot,” Carmelo Anthony said. However, he acknowledged that DeRozan turned himself into Drake’s opposition when he joined Kendrick Lamar on stage at The Pop Out concert and appeared in the “Not Like Us” music video. “Those are shots. You my man, we in the crib, we hanging, we building the 6 up. From that standpoint, that would f**k me up, too. I’m gonna feel a way no matter what, but yes, you do have a conversation. As a man, you have a conversation.” 
	Though Rudy Gay did not like the “First Person Shooter” rapper’s actions, he leveled with Anthony on that part. “If you got a problem, come at me,” he said. “To see your man’s out there dancing with the enemy, that’s kinda crazy.” 
	Drake and DeMar DeRozan went viral earlier this month when the For All The Dogs rapper sat courtside for the Toronto Raptors matchup against the Sacramento Kings. At one point, he was interviewed on air and said, “Unfortunately, we’re playing this goof [DeRozan] tonight, but it is what it is” as well as “If you ever put up a DeRozan banner, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.”

	








 
	After the Raptors defeated the Kings, Drake could be seen mouthing “F**k outta here pu**y” as DeRozan walked off the court. During a post-game press conference, the six-time All-Star was asked about the comments regarding the banner and said, “Well he gon’ have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck.” 
	This is a significant change in their relationship, just three years after DeRozan said that Drake would “forever have a friend” in him. When he was traded from the Raptors to the Spurs, despite being told he would not be traded, the five-time Grammy winner invited him to his house and gave him support in his time of disappointment. Even after appearing at The Pop Out and in the “Not Like Us” music video, he claimed that he still had love for the OVO head honcho. Those days are seemingly over.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Riley Gaines repeatedly tears into AOC for taking pronouns out of X bio after advocating for trans athletes,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/riley-gaines-mocks-aoc-taking-pronouns-out-x-bio-advocating-trans-athletes,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 18:19:24 -0500","Former college swimmer Riley Gaines repeatedly mocked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on social media on Thursday after it was revealed that the congresswoman took her pronouns out of her bio.","Former college swimmer Riley Gaines joins 'FOX & Friends' to discuss former President Trump's vow to keep transgender athletes out of women's sports during his Fox News town hall. Riley Gaines didn't let Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., off the hook for not using the right pronouns anymore.  The congresswoman was the subject of trending conversation on social media on Thursday when X users discovered that she no longer includes her pronouns ""she/her"" in her bio. Gaines, a former NCAA swimmer and OutKick contributor, got in on the mockery of Ocasio-Cortez on X with multiple posts.  ""They’ll pretend they never embraced (or even celebrated) the insanity. Don’t forget who the compliant, virtue-signaling sheep were,"" Gaines wrote in response to a post that claimed Ocasio-Cortez took the pronouns out of her bio before May of this year.  Gaines later responded to a video that showed Ocasio-Cortez previously apologizing for not including pronouns in her bio next to a photo that showed they were no longer there.  ""We're winning and its glorious,"" Gaines wrote. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., speaks onstage during the first day of the Democratic National Convention at United Center in Chicago on Aug. 19. ( Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Then even later on Thursday, Gaines made one more effort to mock Ocasio-Cortez in a solo post.  ""How will we know what to call AOC now that her pronouns in her bio are gone?!?!?!,"" Gaines wrote.  Gaines previously lambasted Ocasio-Cortez for her stance on trans athletes in women's sports. The Democratic congresswoman has been a frequent advocate for transgender rights and trans inclusion in women's sports during her tenure. Ocasio-Cortez recently spoke out against Green Party vice presidential candidate Butch Ware for saying he did not believe trans athletes should play in women's sports, calling the ticket ""predatory.""  ""AOC says it's predatory behavior to not want men competing in women's sports. To AOC, acknowledging biological reality is ‘predatory’ You know what's actually predatory? Sexualizing children and normalizing pedophilia,"" Gaines wrote on X while posting a Fox News Digital article about Ocasio-Cortez' comments. Ocasio-Cortez has taken a partisan stance in her support of transgender rights and protections.  After the Biden-Harris administration passed a sweeping reform to Title IX in April that aimed to provide more protection for gender identity in schools and universities, Ocasio-Cortez argued the reform did not go far enough in favor of transgender people and, specifically, transgender athletes who want to compete in women's sports. ""Absolutely no reason for the Biden admin to do this. It is indefensible and embarrassing. The admin can still walk this back, and they should. It’s a disgrace,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote in response to a report that the change would allow schools to bar transgender athletes from women's and girls' sports.  The administration issued a sweeping rule that clarified that Title IX’s ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions."" And while the administration insisted the regulation does not address athletic eligibility, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that it would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.  Still, that wasn't good enough for Ocasio-Cortez.  INSIDE SAN JOSE STATE'S POLICE BATTLE TO PROTECT WOMEN'S ATHLETES THREATENED BY A TRANSGENDER CULTURE WAR Former competitive swimmer Riley Gaines speaks during a campaign rally for former President Trump at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale, Arizona, on Aug. 23. (Rebecca Noble/Getty Images) Ocasio-Cortez has also co-sponsored the Equality Act, which was proposed in 2019 and has had revisions that ""would force public schools to allow biologically male athletes who identify as transgender on girls' sports teams."" In March 2023, Democrats, including Ocasio-Cortez, advocated for a transgender bill of rights, proposing a resolution ""recognizing that it is the duty of the Federal Government to develop and implement a Transgender Bill of Rights.""  The resolution specifically called for a federal law to ensure that biological men can ""participate in sports on teams and in programs that best align with their gender identity [and] use school facilities that best align with their gender identity."" Meanwhile, Gaines has passionately fought against trans inclusion in women's sports as a former college swimmer who infamously tied with trans athlete Lia Thomas at the NCAA championships in 2022.  Gaines shared her harrowing recollection of her experience being forced to share a locker room with Thomas at a Trump campaign rally on Oct. 23.  ""I could share the grotesque details of what it was like being forced to undress, inches away from a 6-foot-4 man who watched us strip down to nothing, while he did the same, exposing his fully-intact naked male body,"" Gaines said. ""There are no words to describe the violation and the betrayal, the humiliation that we felt.""  Gaines leads a lawsuit against the NCAA with other female athletes, accusing the governing body of violating their Title IX rights due to its policies on gender identity.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Riley Gaines is sworn in during a House Oversight Subcommittee on Health Care and Financial Services hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 5, 2023. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, details the shock Gaines and other swimmers felt when they learned they would have to share a locker room with Thomas at the 2022 championships in Atlanta. It documents a number of races they swam with Thomas, including the 200-yard final in which Thomas and Gaines tied for fifth but Thomas, not Gaines, was handed the fifth-place trophy. Meanwhile, many other Democrats have backed off from their support for transgender inclusion in women's sports prior to and after the election.  Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass, and Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., spoke out against trans inclusion in a New York Times article.  Moulton's comments have incited a flury of backlash against him from Democratic allies who have deemed his words ""transphobic."" Still, Moulton has only doubled-down on the comments amid the controversy.  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said Tuesday that the Democratic Party was 'talking down' to Americans in response to backlash over his recent comments about transgender women in sports. Massachusetts Democrats are planning a rally for transgender rights after Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., spoke out against trans athletes in women's sports.  The rally will take place on Sunday in Moulton's hometown of Salem, where he was born in 1978, according to Salem City Councilor Kyle Davis.  ""In the wake of Trump's election and Seth Moulton's recent transphobic comments, I am working with local LGBT organizations and local leaders on a large rally in Salem outside of Moulton's office,"" Davis told Fox News Digital.  ""This rally is meant to express first and foremost to the trans community that we stand in solidarity with them but also to communicate to Seth Moulton that we do not agree with his stance and his willingness to throw this community under the bus.""

Lee/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) Moulton incited fierce backlash by Democrat allies and liberals at large after he made comments in a New York Times article last week after President-elect Trump's election victory. Moulton spoke out against his own party for making too much of an effort to champion for trans inclusion in women's sports, and blamed it as a reason for losing the election.  ""I have two little girls. I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that,"" Moulton said.  Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., also spoke out against trans inclusion in the same article.  Moulton has since defended and doubled-down on his comments amid the backlash by his own party.  Davis previously called for Moulton to resign in a post on X.  ""I’m not looking for an apology from [Moulton], I’m looking for a resignation,"" Davis said. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called the remarks ""offensive"" during a recent interview on CNN. Meanwhile, Massachusetts state Rep.

Moulton himself appeared to confirm the situation on Tuesday morning, but Tufts University has denied limiting internship opportunities with his office. The source told Fox News Digital, however, that Moulton’s office had been contacted by Tufts University Political Science Department Chair David Art on the matter. Moulton addressed the alleged issue with Tufts on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""Imagine if one of these Tuft students actually wants to intern in a Republican office? I mean, what would these political science professors do then? This is just everything that is wrong with this cancel culture,"" Moulton responded.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., attacked the Green Party presidential ticket after the party's vice presidential nominee, Butch Ware, spoke out against transgender athletes in women's sports. Ocasio-Cortez called the ticket ""predatory"" in response to Ware's stance. In June, a survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago asked respondents to weigh in on whether transgender athletes of both sexes should be permitted to participate in sports leagues that correspond to their preferred gender identity instead of their biological sex.  Sixty-five percent answered that it should be never or rarely allowed. When those polled were asked specifically about adult transgender female athletes competing on women’s sports teams, 69% opposed it.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Packers legend Clay Matthews admits Aaron Rodgers' struggles with Jets have been 'hard to watch' this season,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/packers-legend-clay-matthews-admits-aaron-rodgers-struggles-jets-has-been-hard-watch-season,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 14:24:24 -0500","Clay Matthews, the Packers Hall of Famer who spent many years terrorizing teams with Aaron Rodgers, admits it&apos;s been frustrating to watch his old teammate with the New York Jets.","Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. For 10 seasons, Clay Matthews and Aaron Rodgers were key members of the Green Bay Packers, leading the way on their respective sides of the ball.  Matthews, the feared outside linebacker who was inducted into the Packers Hall of Fame, has since retired from the game. But Rodgers, the four-time MVP quarterback, continues playing with the New York Jets.  The success these two had together — a Super Bowl in 2011 included — is a departure from what Rodgers is seeing in New York. The Jets have not lived up to the hype since he was traded from Green Bay to New York last season.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Green Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews, left, points to Super Bowl MVP Aaron Rodgers after giving him a championship belt after the win against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Super Bowl at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Feb. 6, 2011. (Imagn) Matthews spoke to Fox News Digital this week, admitting it's hard to watch his friend and former teammate struggle.  ""It is tough for me to watch because there’s no bigger fan of Aaron than me,"" Matthews said while also discussing his upcoming appearance at Lambeau Field with the Crown Royal Rig Thanksgiving Day. ""I enjoy watching the Jets. Obviously, Davante’s been over there. I mean, they have star power up and down the offense, but, unfortunately, they just haven’t been clicking. It’s hard to watch."" With Rodgers healed from his Achilles injury suffered on the fourth snap of the 2023 season, the expectation was the Jets would break out of their 13-year playoff drought.  AARON RODGERS PINPOINTS JETS' BIGGEST HURDLE: ‘IT’S US AGAINST US' Instead, they find themselves at 3-7 through 10 games, needing to virtually win out to have a legitimate shot at doing so.  As Matthews mentioned, the star power is vast when it comes to the Jets' offense, with Davante Adams, an old friend of theirs from the Packers, the latest to join the group after a trade with the Las Vegas Raiders.  But the old connection that was so lethal in Green Bay with Rodgers has yet to break out with the Jets. And prior to Adams' arrival, Rodgers just hasn't found the consistency he'd like, and the record shows it.  The Jets are 26th in total offense (298.5 yards per game) and 17th in passing yards per game (211.7). New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers throws against the Arizona Cardinals during the first half Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz.  (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) As Rodgers said on his weekly appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show,"" the Jets' biggest hurdle is ""it's us against us,"" and Matthews knows Rodgers will be trying to lead by example behind closed doors.  ""I'm not sure much words are going to help,"" Matthews said.  ""I think he’s just staying the course. I mean, for a guy who’s a 20-year vet, he’s been through everything. He’s battle tested, and he’s obviously still one of the best. He can make all the throws. So, I don’t know what the moral needs to be. You constantly hear the quotes of them coming out flat and what not. At this point, I’m not sure much words are going to help as far as, ‘We need to pick it up.’  ""The Jets, it’s been a while since they’ve been in the playoffs.  It’s been a while since I’m sure they’ve had a winning season. It needs to change, but, unfortunately, I don’t know if this is the year. Perhaps maybe they pick it up towards the latter part, but it’s tough sledding when the future looks to be bleak."" Does the future past the 2024 campaign involve Rodgers? He's under contract for the 2025 season, but none of the compensation is guaranteed. Rodgers could also choose to retire.  Matthews can't see that happening, though, especially with the way this season has been going.  Former Green Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews speaks during a press conference before the 2024 Packers Hall of Fame induction banquet Aug. 29, 2024, at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis. (Imagn) ""Aaron’s too much of a competitor. We’ll see how he feels. Obviously, coming back after that Achilles, it seems to be behind him now. Dealing with some knee and hamstring issues that limited his mobility,"" Matthews said. ""I know my last year in Green Bay, I wanted to come back and finish on a high note or at least continue it. As a competitor, you have to have that look in the mirror, so to speak. But I still think he can make all the throws and do what he needs to do.""  GIVING BACK WITH CROWN ROYAL While Matthews is a Jets fan when it comes to supporting Rodgers, he will always be a Packer, which is why he teamed up with Crown Royal, the official whiskey sponsor of the NFL, in its fourth year of the Kick Off with Crown program.  This year, Crown Royal launched its one-of-a-kind tailgate on wheels with the Crown Royal Rig, a purple 18-wheeler touring NFL stadiums to not just wow NFL fans with players like Matthews, but to also support the military.  Matthews talked about his excitement about not only being able to return to Lambeau to mingle with Packers fans on Thanksgiving night before his former team’s game against the Miami Dolphins, but also why this tailgate is so important. Fans will be putting together care packages for military members with Crown Royal’s longtime partner, Packages From Home. The 18-wheeler Crown Royal Rig is traveling the country to different NFL stadiums to help the military. (Crown Royal) ""I think what’s even more important is how Crown Royal is giving back to the military community, specifically with their Purple Bag Project,"" Matthews said. ""Giving away morale-boosting items to our military by giving them the packages from home.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The Packers get a primetime game on Thanksgiving.

The report from Le Correspondent cited a French-Algerian medical report and claimed Khelif was impacted by a sex development disorder that is only found in biological males. The report said that without a proper medical examination, the wrong gender is assigned at birth. It was Khelif’s first remarks about the report since its release. Fox News Digital reached out to Khelif’s lawyers but did not hear back. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) told Fox News Digital it understood that Khelif was preparing a lawsuit against the journalist. ""We understand that Imane Khelif has taken legal action against individuals who commented on her situation during the Olympic Games Paris 2024, and is also preparing a lawsuit in response to the latest reporting,"" the IOC said. ""The IOC will not comment while legal action is ongoing, or on media reports about unverified documents whose origin cannot be confirmed.""

The International Olympic Committee has violated all sports rules by putting a man against a woman. Tests have again confirmed that Imane Khelif is indeed a man,"" Kremlev said last week. ""Today, as the President of the International Boxing Association, which upholds gender equality and protects both women’s and men’s boxing, I demand that Thomas Bach and his team both verbally and in writing, apologize to the global boxing community.  ""Thomas Bach himself bears direct responsibility for this, as he personally lobbied for this to happen – for men to compete against women. On behalf of all boxers in the world, I demand them to kneel and apologize to the boxing community and to those girls who have been beaten and abused. Thomas Bach, I am now waiting, as is everyone in IBA, for your official apology."" Khelif was embroiled in controversy before and throughout the Paris Olympics after reports surfaced over a failed gender test that led to a disqualification at the International Boxing Association World Championships. The Algerian Olympic Committee said at the time that Khelif was disqualified for ""medical reasons.""  The issue was a dark cloud over the women’s boxing portion of the Olympics, as Khelif faced accusations of being a man competing in the women’s division. Khelif pushed back on all accusations about gender. President-elect Donald Trump and Italian Giorgi Meloni both remarked about the Khelif controversy.

He told Fox News Digital he is donating his paycheck to Tunnel to Towers.,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Eric Bischoff will be back and better than ever – at least for one night. The legendary pro wrestling figure will take control of the Major League Wrestling (MLW) One Shot event in New York City on Dec. 5. He told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview he would donate his entire paycheck to the Tunnel to Towers Foundation. ""One of the things I told (MLW founder Court Bauer) right away was this isn’t about the money,"" Bischoff said. ""He started to negotiate my fee and I really wasn’t interested in negotiating it, I just said whatever it is, I’m going to donate it to Tunnel to Towers. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Eric Bischoff speaks onstage at The Roast of Ric Flair at Nashville Fairgrounds on July 29, 2022 in Nashville, Tennessee.  (Jason Kempin/Getty Images) ""So, it doesn’t matter, and I don’t want to negotiate it. I just want whatever it is to be donated because I’m not doing this for the money. I’m doing it for the fun."" Bischoff will be calling the shots for the one night of pro wrestling at the Melrose Ballroom in Queens. He said he talked to Bauer for several years about doing a show with MLW, but the timing was just never right. Then, the stars aligned. Paul Walter Hauser, an actor-turned-MLW wrestler, joined Bischoff on the wrestling mogul’s YouTube show ""Life Choices."" As the two discussed the business, Hauser called Bauer live and the dominoes fell into place from there. Talented pro wrestlers have moved through the company, including Alex Shelley, Austin Aries, Lexis King (then known as Brian Pillman Jr.), Francine, Gangrel, Jacob Fatu, Karrion Kross (then known as Killer Kross), Konnan, Matt Cardona, MJF, Tajiri and several others.  FROM ACTING TO THE SQUARED CIRCLE, EMMY WINNER HAUSER IS READY TO RUMBLE FOR MAJOR LEAGUE WRESTLING Eric Bischoff was formerly the head of World Championship Wrestling. (Major League Wrestling) The roster now includes established talents like KENTA, Matt Riddle, Satoshi Kojima, Mistico, Minoru Suzuki, Bobby Fish and The Andersons, among others. Donovan Dijak also made his debut with the company over the summer after his contract with WWE was not renewed. ""They’re obviously attracting some great talent. Court, as a former writer in WWE, understands the art of storytelling. I love the fact that they’re the underdog, and they’re kind of, of course, building this brand from the ground up. ""And, I love watching emerging companies – whether it’s in the wrestling business or anything else. I’m just fascinated with the prospect of MLW growing and reaching the next level or whatever it may be for them."" Bischoff has been behind some of the most interesting creative angles in pro wrestling history, as he helped establish the New World Order faction in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which saw Hulk Hogan go from the good guy to a heel, joining the likes of Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, collectively known as The Outsiders. The decision sparked the ""Monday Night Wars"" with WWE (then known as the World Wrestling Federation) and put WCW on top for more than a year in the ratings battle. In the end, WCW flamed out, but Bischoff’s influence in the business was far from cooled. He joined WWE to become the on-air general manager of the RAW brand and was also an executive producer for Total Nonstop Action wrestling. EX-WWE STAR DONOVAN DIJAK MAKES ELECTRIC MAJOR LEAGUE WRESTLING DEBUT: 'EXECUTION WAS FLAWLESS' Eric Bischoff will take over creative for Major League Wrestling for one night. (Major League Wrestling) Bischoff told Fox News Digital he is already starting to enjoy getting back into the creative aspect of the wrestling business and is looking forward to creating a show. It does not exactly mean he is looking for a return in the long run. ""I don’t even think about that,"" he said. ""One of the things I told Court is that for me to do something in wrestling now, it has to be fun. If it’s not fun for me, if it’s just a job, or if it’s just a payday, I’m really not that interested. … When it comes to putting my toe back in the water in wrestling, my first priority is that it has to be fun. If it’s not fun, I’m not interested. ""So it all depends. I honestly, to be very transparent about it, I can’t see it. I like my life just the way it is. I live in a beautiful part of the country out in the middle of nowhere where I can look out my back window and see Yellowstone National Park. …  ""So, for me to commit – just committing to professional wrestling is 24 hours, seven days a week. If you’re not doing it, you’re thinking about it. If you’re not thinking about it, you’re worrying about it. If you’re not worrying about it, you’re sleeping. It’s hard for me to imagine. But again, it depends how much fun I have. If it’s successful and everybody, not just me, but if the audience enjoys, if Court and his team – most importantly- enjoy the process, then, you know, anything’s possible. But highly unlikely. Let’s put it that way."" Eric Bischoff attends SiriusXM's ""Busted Open"" celebrating their 10th anniversary In New York City on the eve of WrestleMania 35 on April 6, 2019 in New York City.

SportsLogos.Net News,NLL Adds 13 More Community Identities to UnBOXed Program,https://news.sportslogos.net/2024/11/14/nll-adds-13-more-community-identities-to-unboxed-program/other/,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 21:08:00 +0000",Program aims to introduce young boys and girls to the game of lacrosse through gym classes and hopes community-relevant names will help engage people in identified markets,"The National Lacrosse League’s grassroots campaign got a lot bigger this week. On Thursday, November 14, the NLL unveiled 13 new community identities for its UnBOXed program, which aims to introduce young boys and girls to the game of lacrosse in their gym classes. These are not expansion teams, but the NLL hopes these identities and community-relevant names will help engage people in these markets and encourage them to participate in the UnBOXed program. They also hope they “illustrate the League’s commitment to growing box lacrosse across Canada and the United States” as they work toward their goal of becoming the “next major league.” “NLL UnBOXed illustrates our bold approach and dedicated commitment to growing the game of lacrosse and welcoming new NLL fans to our uniquely entertaining sport. As we invite and welcome more communities, schools, families, and fans to the NLL, while strengthening our connections in these key areas throughout North America, we move one step closer to our goal of becoming ‘The Next Major League.’” The NLL hopes to expand its activation footprint to 60 communities across North America by the time the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles roll around. Those games will include sixes lacrosse — a format similar to the box lacrosse played in the NLL — as a medal sport for the first time since 1908. The NLL is also part of the Elevate 28 initiative, which aims to increase the number of people participating in lacrosse in the U.S. to 4 million by 2030. The 13 new UnBOXed identities, combined with the 14 current NLL franchises, bring the league’s total activation footprint to 36 markets throughout North America. Here’s a closer look at the new identities, with all graphics courtesy of the NLL’s Facebook page: The initial nine UnBOXed identities were launched in November 2023. Since then, though, the St. Louis entry changed its name from the Rhythm to the Howlers, and with the Ottawa Black Bears joining the NLL, the Ottawa Electrics became the Dallas Oilcats, an identity that uses elements of the now-defunct Panther City Lacrosse Club logo. The 2024-25 NLL regular season gets underway on Friday, November 29, with two games. A new Battle of Ontario will spark up with the Ottawa Black Bears playing host to the Toronto Rock, while the Vancouver Warriors visit the Colorado Mammoth later that evening.",2024-11-14

The Nittany Lions launched the uniforms on their website and social media channels on Wednesday, November 13, and will wear them on the ice for the first time against Big Ten rivals Wisconsin on Friday, November 15. The jerseys borrow heavily from the Nittany Lions’ look in the 1940s, when Penn State’s hockey program was first founded. The white base has navy blue shoulders and a navy blue “PS” monogram on the front. Navy barberpole-style stripes adorn the sleeves and the socks. The navy blue numbers on the sleeves and back “mimics the number font used on the Generations of Greatness football jerseys,” while the contrasting nameplate on the back is navy blue with white lettering. The retro look is rounded out by brown pants and gloves. The pants also feature an interlocking “PSU” logo used in the 1970s that has a puck between the P and the S. The helmets are navy blue, with a raised white “Penn State” logo on the sides and white player numbers on the front. For captains, the C appears in a navy blue keystone on the right chest. “Penn State’s ice hockey tradition began well before we ever had a Division I program and we owe a debt of gratitude to those previous eras for establishing the foundation of Hockey Valley,” Nittany Lions head coach Guy Gadowsky said on the team’s website. “These throwback uniforms represent the different periods that helped build our program into what it is today and it’s our way of giving those teams a stick tap to the shins to express our appreciation to everyone that laid the foundation for the modern era of Penn State Hockey.” Old Time Hockey! 😤#HockeyValley pic.twitter.com/chvGMCj1wN Penn State played its first varsity hockey game on December 6, 1940, against Carnegie Tech. The program continued for four seasons until it was cut — along with cross country, swimming, gymnastics, tennis and golf — as part of cost-cutting measures during the Second World War. It returned for one season in 1946, but limited facilities meant it was once again dropped. In 1971, 3,000 people signed a petition to bring hockey back to Penn State. The team — dubbed the Icers — played 41 seasons and won seven national championships before the Division I era began in 2012. As a pure “start-up” team, it seemed too gaudy for them to display the name Penn State on the first jerseys. Thus, a custom logo was designed as a unique moniker for the front of the jersey. A creative, stylized amalgamation of letters and hockey imagery, the logo features the initials of Penn State University with two hockey sticks surrounding a puck in the negative space between the letters. The artist responsible for the design, a Penn State student, has remained anonymous despite multiple efforts. Following Friday’s game against Wisconsin — the first of a six-game homestand for Penn State — these alternate uniforms will enter their jersey lineup “as a true alternate to be worn multiple times throughout the next few seasons.”",2024-11-14

Valencia players will wear their black away kits at home on Saturday, November 23, when they host Real Betis. The all-black uniform is meant as “a sign of respect for those who died due to the DANA catastrophe and in solidarity with all those affected.” More than 200 people in the Valencia region died in late October when a destructive weather system known locally as DANA — the Spanish acronym for high-altitude isolated depression — moved through the area, causing torrential rainfall and massive flooding. Valencia’s usual front-of-shirt sponsor has given up their space for the November 23 game, and their logo will be replaced by the motto “AMUNT VALENCIANS” (“Come on, Valencians”). Printed on the back, below the player number, will be another motto: “UNITS CON SEMPRE” (“United as Always”). The black away kit, made by Puma, features an embossed pattern that reimagines the city of Valencia’s flag and its “distinctive blue band filigree as a subtle background pattern on a sleek black shirt with elegant gold accents.” Game-worn jerseys will be auctioned off online afterwards through MatchWornShirt. Proceeds from the auction will go to “help resume sporting and educational activities for children affected by the DANA crisis.” The game against Real Betis will be Valencia CF’s first match since the DANA tragedy. An away match against RCD Espanyol scheduled for Sunday, November 9, was postponed. Puma and Valencia CF have also teamed up to offer a solidarity T-shirt for sale, with proceeds again going toward sports and educational activities for children affected by the storm. It features the “UNITS CON SEMPRE” motto on the front and a list of cities and towns affected by flooding on the back. The shirt is available through Valencia’s online store and through Puma.com.",2024-11-14

That was also the first season that USC sported the trojan head logo on the sides of its cardinal helmets, as well as a modified Northwestern striping pattern on the sleeves of its cardinal home and white road jerseys. This design was worn until the 2002 season, when then-head coach Pete Carroll reintroduced the crescent-shaped shoulder design the Trojans initially wore from 1958-71 and still wear to this day. USC will wear metallic helmets with chrome face masks as a modern update to the classic look for Homecoming. #FightOn pic.twitter.com/5zP4pF6sBR This will mark the first time that USC has deviated from its standard home or road uniforms since the Trojans wore a metallic version of their cardinal helmets with chrome facemasks for select games during the 2014-15 seasons. They also added gold flakes to their standard gray facemasks in 2012, but – aside from that small detail – they have consistently worn Saturday’s throwback uniform or their current design for more than 65 years. The Trojans wore these uniforms, which are complete with their standard gold pants with two cardinal stripes down the sides, under legendary coach John Robinson (1976-82, 1993-97), who passed away on Monday at the age of 89. One of @uscfb's all-time best coaches and one of the band's all-time best friends.#FightOnForever Coach Robinson. pic.twitter.com/k89SgvvD2C He also served as USC’s offensive coordinator from 1972-74, so it’s somewhat fitting the program will wear the throwback uniforms this weekend against the Cornhuskers.

But Eberflus didn't guarantee Waldron would be calling plays when the Bears host the Packers (6-3) this Sunday. ""The process of that, we're going through that right now. All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.

Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play.

Williams and the Bears were dominated by the New England Patriots (3-7) on Sunday, Chicago's third consecutive loss, and head into Week 11 with a run of 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown. The Bears scored three points against the Patriots, one week after putting up nine points at Arizona, and were held under 17 points for the fifth time this season. New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Offensive coordinator Shane Waldron received a vote of confidence coming out of the loss to Arizona.

Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff.

Williams and the Bears were dominated by the New England Patriots (3-7) on Sunday, Chicago's third consecutive loss, and head into Week 11 with a run of 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown. The Bears scored three points against the Patriots, one week after putting up nine points at Arizona, and were held under 17 points for the fifth time this season. New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Offensive coordinator Shane Waldron received a vote of confidence coming out of the loss to Arizona.

All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff.

New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Offensive coordinator Shane Waldron received a vote of confidence coming out of the loss to Arizona. But Eberflus didn't guarantee Waldron would be calling plays when the Bears host the Packers (6-3) this Sunday. ""The process of that, we're going through that right now. All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.  ""It's important that we're using all the people in the building on the coaching staff, getting all the input, putting our minds together to come up with the best answer,"" Eberflus said.

Williams and the Bears were dominated by the New England Patriots (3-7) on Sunday, Chicago's third consecutive loss, and head into Week 11 with a run of 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown. The Bears scored three points against the Patriots, one week after putting up nine points at Arizona, and were held under 17 points for the fifth time this season. New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Offensive coordinator Shane Waldron received a vote of confidence coming out of the loss to Arizona. But Eberflus didn't guarantee Waldron would be calling plays when the Bears host the Packers (6-3) this Sunday. ""The process of that, we're going through that right now. All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.

The Bears scored three points against the Patriots, one week after putting up nine points at Arizona, and were held under 17 points for the fifth time this season. New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Offensive coordinator Shane Waldron received a vote of confidence coming out of the loss to Arizona.

He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play.

Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season.

But Eberflus didn't guarantee Waldron would be calling plays when the Bears host the Packers (6-3) this Sunday. ""The process of that, we're going through that right now. All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.  ""It's important that we're using all the people in the building on the coaching staff, getting all the input, putting our minds together to come up with the best answer,"" Eberflus said.

Sports Collectors Daily,Jackie Robinson’s Handwritten UCLA English Paper on Sports at Auction,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/jackie-robinson-handwritten-college-english-paper/,"Tue, 12 Nov 2024 01:46:16 +0000",A 15-page English class project created by Jackie Robinson at UCLA in 1940 and a variety of other autographs and sports cards are among the items in the Weiss Auctions fall catalog.,"November 11, 2024 By Rich Mueller  Even in the classroom, Jackie Robinson couldn’t hide his love of sports.  In 1940, the Bruins’ star running back, track star and baseball standout used one instructor’s course to create a report on the origins of three sports, football, baseball and hockey. Now the quaint, handwritten creation he turned during an English III class at UCLA in 1940 is about to go up for sale. Weiss Auctions is offering the 15-page report—all in Robinson’s hand and complete with pictures he pasted to illustrate his conclusions—in its Fall Auction. The one-of-a-kind piece is expected to sell for $15,000-$25,000.  According to the auction company, the report was purchased years ago from the estate of long-time UCLA assistant football coach A.J. Sturzenegger and comes with a JSA Letter of Authenticity. It’s believed to be the first time it’s been offered publicly. “We are very excited to be able to handle a terrific item like this,” Weiss Auctions Founder Phil Weiss told SC Daily. ” In over 40 years in the auction business, we’ve had the opportunity to handle the sale of some very unique and significant items and this definitely would be near the top of that list.”  The auction cuts a wide swath across sports and non-sports card categories.  Collectors of pre-War vintage cards will find a group of rare 1932 US Caramel card, including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, 1933 Goudey issues of the two Yankee sluggers and several other lots featuring tobacco cards and 1940s Play Ball.    A fully graded 1956 Topps baseball set kicks off the post-War offerings, joined by complete 1951 Red and Blue back sets and a 1963 Topps set.  There are also 1950s and 60s stars including numerous Mickey Mantle cards. Among the modern card lots is a partial PSA 9-graded set of 1993 Topps Finest Baseball.  For those who really want a trip back into cardboard nostalgia, there are 1950s Exhibit and baseball card vending machines up for grabs.  Non-sports offerings include the highest graded 1953 Topps Who-Z-At set, a 1933 Jungle Gum graded set and many other vintage TV show master sets. There are dozens of autographed items, including those penned by Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle, with several of the latter carrying inscriptions.  A 1950 Yankees team signed baseball also includes one of the first signatures of Mantle with the Bronx Bombers while a rookie year government postcard carrying his early autograph is also on the block.     Other signed items include a Ty Cobb check, a Roy Campanella signed 1956 Topps card, a Derek Jeter Little Sun Prospect signed card, an Andre the Giant signed magazine, a 1986 World Series ticket signed by Buckner and Wilson and other items. The auction is open for pre-bidding now and will close a live session on Wednesday, Nov. 20. Rich is the editor and founder of Sports Collectors Daily.

Now, redemption cards for complete sets of 1986-87 Fleer basketball are part of the 'Finale' of Jersey Fusion's ode to the original landmark product.","November 11, 2024 By Rich Mueller  Late last spring, cards from 50 complete sets of 1986-87 Fleer basketball and another hoard of 125 Michael Jordan rookie cards and stickers were put into a new product from Sportscards.com’s Jersey Fusion Line. Described as a years in the making “passion project” for company founder Bobby Poll, the Beckett encapsulated cards include small swatches of game-used gear used by the player on the card. Thousands of one card boxes were sold but six months later, the company has added some fresh content to the remaining inventory, including three redemption cards for fully PSA graded complete sets of cards and stickers, each with a Jordan rookie graded NM/MT 8.   The 1986-87 Fleer Jersey Fusion “Finale Edition” boxes also include a fourth redemption for a complete Jersey Fusion set of the 132 cards and 11 stickers that included the memorabilia pieces embedded in the holder. That set was originally pieced together by a collector who took advantage of the company’s offer last spring to trade it in for a game-worn, autographed 1991-92 Jordan jersey.  Sportscards.com is now giving that set back to the collecting community through the sales of the Finale edition. The product contains cards and memorabilia for all 131 players that were featured on the landmark Fleer set, which was the first in five years to be sold via wax packs.    At least three of the five boxes in a display case have autographed cards. Full cases contain six display cartons with a total of around 20 autographs. Some of the autographed cards carry inscriptions.  One of the biggest hits in the product One of the top pulls was an autographed Jordan rookie that carries a 9 autograph grade from Beckett and a portion of an NBA ‘Logoman’ patch from one of Jordan’s 1987-88 home uniforms. Other chase cards carry pieces of basketballs used in the NBA Finals.   Autographs from about 100 of the players in the set are possible, including Jordan, Julius Erving, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Charles Barkley and the late Bill Walton. A checklist that’s been pulled includes autographs of Erving, Bird and Johnson.  The back of each card in the product has a QR code on the reverse side that bring the collector to the site to see the original game-used  memorabilia item from which it was taken. Memorabilia used in the Jersey Fusion product came from jerseys, warm-ups, trunks, shoes, basketballs and even surfaces of NBA courts. Boxes and cases of the most recent edition are available here.  The previously released version, which still offers randomly packed Jordan rookie cards and stickers are still selling on eBay here.

The jersey, worn the day before he suited up for the last time, dates to Oct. 6, 2001.  It was one of the key items in an auction featuring items from his career that came from the late Hall of Famer’s family and were sold by The Realest, a memorabilia company that launched earlier this year.  The final games of Gwynn’s career took place slightly later than normal due to the Sept. 11 attacks. The jersey includes the American flag patch worn by on-field personnel after play resumed.  Another jersey with the flag patch, presumably from the same time period, sold for just over $5,000. Several other items sold for five-figure prices including Gwynn’s 1987 Gold Glove award ($25,001), his 1999 All-Star Game jersey ($12,555), his 1997 Silver Slugger award ($11,500) and a 1999 Padres alternate game jersey that included an inscription indicating it was from his 2,997th career hit.

Sports Collectors Daily,Kahn’s Final Football Set In 1964 Was Colorful And Loaded With Stars,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/kahns-final-football-set-in-1964-was-colorful-and-loaded-with-stars/,"Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:30:24 +0000","Sixty years ago, Kahn's wrapped up a short run of football card set with their only full-color NFL offering.","November 11, 2024 By Bob D'Angelo  Let’s be frank: Kahn’s Wieners had a great run for enthusiastic foodie sports card collectors. In baseball, Kahn’s released sets from 1955 through 1969. The company added basketball cards to the mix in 1957, and those were issued through 1965. It was inevitable, perhaps, that the Cincinnati-based meat company would include pro football. Kahn’s produced sets from 1959 through 1964, and the final set is one of the most coveted. Kahn’s, which was founded by Elias Kahn as a meat market in 1883, became a landmark in Cincinnati. After he died in 1899, Kahn’s children founded E. Kahn’s and Sons, By 1926 it was one of the nation’s largest independent meat processing companies. The company’s slogan was  “The Wiener The World Awaited.” In the 1964 Kahn’s football set, some long-awaited technology was introduced: full-color photography.  The borderless cards measured 3 inches by 3 5/8 inches and 53 were different were on the checklist. The company’s slogan, which had appeared in a white rectangle at the bottom of the card fronts of previous Kahn’s football issues, was relegated to the backs in the 1964 set. The backs also contained statistics and brief biographical sketches.    The cards, which were not numbered, were included in select packages of the wieners and were referenced in advertising as “photos.”  For the second consecutive year, players from all 14 NFL teams were included. However, in keeping with the regional nature of the Kahn’s sets, nine cards feature members of the Cleveland Browns, who were on their way to the 1964 NFL championship. The set contains the top players of the 1960s and 19 future Hall of Famers, including Doug Atkins, Jim Brown, Mike Ditka, Paul Hornung, Sam Huff, John Henry Johnson, Alex Karras, Dick “Night Train” Lane, Jim Ringo, Joe Schmidt, Bart Starr, Fran Tarkenton, Jim Taylor, Y.A. Tittle, Johnny Unitas and Paul Warfield. The poses are classic 1960s football. Warfield’s card in the 1964 Kahn’s issue is the earliest to feature the smooth wide receiver, whose rookie card in mainstream cards was first introduced in the 1965 Philadelphia set. The cards are extremely difficult to find in high grade. Of the 1,242 cards submitted to PSA, only 17 achieved gem-mint status and 98 were PSA 9s. There are no PSA 10s of Brown and just six PSA 9s. There are also no PSA 10s of Hornung, Huff, Karras, Lane, Ringo, Schmidt, Starr, Tarkenton, Tittle and Warfield. Unitas has two gem-mint specimens and six that were graded PSA 9, along with Gary Collins and Jim Katcavage. Not surprisingly, the players with the most graded cards are Unitas (54) and Brown (43). Dallas quarterback Don Meredith, who had 20 cards from the set submitted to PSA, only had one card as high as PSA 9 and five at PSA 8. Over at SGC, only 161 cards have been submitted, and only one came back as a 10. That was of defensive back Clendon Thomas, who had a career season in 1963 when he intercepted eight passes for the Pittsburgh Steelers and was chosen for the Pro Bowl. Seven cards were graded as high as SGC 9, with Warfield’s card being one of them. Other notables at that grade included Ditka, Hornung, Katcavage and Norm Snead. The ’64 Kahn’s cards are fairly hard to locate outside the eastern third of the country. A higher grade near set–missing only one card–sold for a little over $2,400 last month.  That was a bit of a bargain.  Fewer than 100 can be found on eBay. The 1964 season was an interesting one for football. Topps lost its license for NFL trading cards and the Philadelphia Chewing Gum Corporation would issue cards that year and through 1967. In the meantime, Topps issued cards from the upstart AFL. In November 1964, the St. Louis Cardinals football team made noises about moving to Atlanta but were persuaded not to by city officials. Atlanta would get its own NFL franchise in 1966. Also in November, Frank and Martin “Buster” Loicano were convicted of accepting illegal bets on football cards while operating their coin-operated machine business. And an ad for Kahn’s Wieners in February 1964 noted that “famed economist” Nellie Oxrider recommended Kahn’s Wieners because “not only are they delicious, but digestible, too.” They were also the only meats used at the New York World’s Fair that year, the company noted. But as far as football cards were concerned, the string of Kahn’s sets was over after ’64. Bob has been a sportswriter and copy editor for more than 45 years and a blogger for two decades. He is celebrating his 60th year of card collecting, and still counts his 1965 Topps Mickey Mantle as his favorite.  You can reach him at [email protected].

The Ecuadorian Football Association announced his death on Tuesday.  Angulo was a passenger in a single-car crash southeast of Quito on Oct. 7 that killed the driver and another passenger. Angulo sustained a head injury and lung contusion and had been put in an artificial coma. He had been on loan from FC Cincinnati to Ecuadorian top-flight side LDU Quito. ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of Marco -- a husband and father, a brother and son, a friend and teammate. He was a joyful, kind young man who lit up every room he entered,"" FC Cincinnati said in a team statement. ""Our entire club grieves this tragedy, and we are thinking of and praying for his family. He was a cherished member of the FC Cincinnati family, and he will be missed."" Angulo joined Cincinnati in December 2022 from Independiente de Valle in Ecuador and was part of Cincinnati's 2023 team that won the Supporters' Shield, paying in 24 matches (nine starts) and posting two assists. He was with LDU Quito the entire 2024 season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

As part of the shakeup, offensive coordinator Shane Waldron was fired on Tuesday. Waldron received a vote of confidence eight days ago after a lopsided 29-9 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, but head coach Matt Eberflus indicated he was resigned to change on Monday.  ""After evaluating our entire operation, I decided that it is in the best interest of our team to move in a different direction with the leadership of our offense,"" Eberflus said in a statement released by the team. ""This decision was well-thought-out, one that was conducted deliberately and respectfully. I would like to thank Shane for his efforts and wish him the best moving forward."" Eberflus selected Waldron as offensive coordinator from a pool that included former Cardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury. Eberflus was retained as head coach by general manager Ryan Poles in January following a 7-10 season. The present situation isn't entirely unfamiliar to Brown. He is being bumped into the primary play-calling role for the second consecutive season. In 2023, the 38-year-old was promoted by the Carolina Panthers with embattled coach Frank Reich giving Brown the call sheet in an effort to spare his own job and pump life into their rookie No. 1 pick at quarterback, Bryce Young.  The Bears are in a bind with the Packers (6-3) up next as confidence and production bottom out on the heels of three consecutive losses and a three-game streak during which rookie No. 1 pick Caleb Williams has zero touchdown passes.  Eberflus said Monday that Williams was safe as the starting quarterback but pointed to imminent changes around the rookie. Williams and the Bears were dominated by the New England Patriots (3-7) on Sunday. They carry a run of 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown into Week 11 trying to keep pace with the rest of the NFC North. Eberflus is 0-4 against Green Bay in his first two seasons as Bears head coach and will see the Packers, Lions (8-1) and Vikings (7-2) twice in the final two months of the season.  The Bears have 27 total points during a three-game slide that began with rookie Jayden Daniels' 52-yard, game-winning Hail Mary on Oct. 27.  Chicago produced three points against the Patriots, putting up fewer than 17 points for the fifth time this season. New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Brown, a former NFL running back who broke into coaching under Sean McVay with the Rams, spent nine seasons on college football staffs including three years as Miami (Fla.) running backs coach and offensive coordinator.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Owner Jerry Jones said Prescott is set for surgery Wednesday in New York. Jones said on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas that quarterback Cooper Rush will start Monday's game against the visiting Houston Texans. Trey Lance will serve as the backup while the team is expected to add fellow quarterback Will Grier to the practice squad. Jones provided optimistic news on Prescott having his surgery in New York. ""He had a good visit last night and he wants to do that there, and he's got great medical doctors up there,"" Jones said. ""His prognosis is wonderful, it just means we're not going to have him the rest of the year."" Signed to a four-year, $240 million contract extension in September that made him the highest-paid quarterback in NFL history, Prescott threw for 1,978 yards with 11 touchdowns and eight interceptions in eight games this season.  Prescott, 31, led the NFL in completions (410) and touchdowns (36) last season. He threw for 4,516 yards in 17 games as Dallas finished the regular season 12-5. A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Prescott owns a 76-46 record in 122 career starts since being picked by Dallas in the fourth round of the 2016 NFL Draft. He has thrown for 31,437 yards with 213 touchdowns and 82 interceptions. Rush flopped in his first start of the season on Sunday, one week after Prescott sustained his injury during the third quarter of a 27-21 loss to the Atlanta Falcons.  Rush completed 13 of 26 passes for 45 yards and lost two fumbles as Dallas dropped its fourth straight game, a 34-6 setback to the Philadelphia Eagles.  Rush was replaced in the fourth quarter by Lance, who went 4-for-6 for 21 yards with an interception in his first regular-season action since being acquired by the Cowboys in 2023.   But the Cowboys (3-6) are turning back to Rush for the Monday night game against the Texans (6-4). ""Because Cooper has shown that he has the capability to compete and win games,"" Jones said. ""And he does give us our best chance. Frankly that was really an out-of-character game for him based on what we've seen.""  Rush, 30, has completed 35 of 62 passes for 212 yards and a touchdown in parts of five games this season.  He has completed 59.7 percent of his passes for 1,831 yards with nine touchdowns and six interceptions in 31 career games (seven starts) with Dallas. Grier, 29, had been with the Cowboys in 2021-22 before being released prior to the 2023 season. He completed 28 of 52 passes for 228 yards in two starts during the 2019 season with the Carolina Panthers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Anybody that gladly took them up on the offer in a game against the Miami Dolphins ended up with indigestion. It was the offense that was supposed to carry the Rams into a new era, but Los Angeles head coach Sean McVay couldn’t get his group over the line in a 23-15 loss Monday. With a fourth consecutive victory there for the taking, the Rams did not score a touchdown behind quarterback Matthew Stafford. Any ideas of rallying from a dreadful 1-4 start and into the playoffs have been put on pause with the current 4-5 record. Stafford has played 50 regular-season games with the Rams. He has now failed to orchestrate a touchdown drive in just two of them. “It was a little bit of this and a little bit of that,” Stafford said of the team’s issues on offense. “We did some really good things and weren’t good enough in some areas. I would say that we were inconsistent.” The Rams were supposed to be about the offense this season, and if anybody wondered why, they just needed to look toward the stands Monday. All-superhero defensive tackle Aaron Donald was in attendance to watch his former teammates, looking as chiseled as ever in retirement. A young Los Angeles defense was supposed to go through growing pains this season, and the offense, filled with elite skill players, was set to move things forward. Well, if Donald was impressed with any group, it was with his former defense. Miami won with just 238 yards of total offense, well below the Rams’ 327 yards. The Dolphins got the job done despite just 208 yards passing and an interception from Tua Tagovailoa. So while the Rams have Stafford, wide receivers Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp and running back Kyren Williams, there is a new group of players looking for top billing. Edge rusher Byron Young and defensive tackle Kobie Turner played as rookies alongside Donald in his final season. Edge rusher Jared Verse and defensive tackle Braden Fiske were drafted after Donald announced that his playing days were done. The Rams already had a Fearsome Foursome in the 1960s, and while this base defense is not the same as that one, the current young group can still be known as the Ferocious Foursome as it continues to progress. Can the Rams still make the playoffs? The loss Monday gave them a playoff probability of 13 percent. Just another sign of their bad luck. Los Angeles built hopes after a rough start that was mostly due to a flood of injuries on offense, including Nacua and Kupp, not to mention multiple starters on the offensive line. But center Jonah Jackson, left guard Steve Avila and right tackle Joe Noteboom all came off injured reserve to play this week, and yet Stafford was hurried all night by a Dolphins defensive front that had underperformed this season. Stafford was sacked four times, while Nacua and Kupp combined for 16 receptions, but none for TDs. It was just one loss, and yet it seems inevitable that some kind of change is ahead for the Rams. After all, Kupp was rumored to be a trade possibility, and then the deadline passed with him still in Los Angeles. The reality is that the front office has signaled they are willing to look at any and all options to build a brighter future. For all that McVay has done in eight seasons as a head coach, he has yet to develop his own quarterback. Stafford is signed through 2026, with no indications the Rams are anywhere near moving away from their star. But he won’t play forever. In a season like this one—with games still remaining against the Philadelphia Eagles, Buffalo Bills, San Francisco 49ers and the first-place Arizona Cardinals—there is a hunger to know what happens next. “There was some execution that has to be better,” McVay said of his offense that he agreed was 'sloppy.’ “These are the things we have to clean up if we want to be the type of (effective) team from an offensive perspective.” The Rams are just 1.5 games behind the suddenly-hot Cardinals in the NFC West and a game behind the second-place 49ers. Hope remains. But as Monday showed, it’s best to be careful about what is on the menu. Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Just two months ago, the NFL world was encouraging Tagovailoa to retire after watching him curl his fingers while down on the turf following a shot to the head during a 31-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills back on September 12.  It was the third confirmed concussion that Tagovailoa has had at the professional level, and it sidelined him for four games. Tagovailoa vowed not to wear a Guardian Cap upon his return. He stuck to his word, which was all well and good, assuming that he would make some playstyle changes to get himself out of harm’s way.  So much for that. After being picked off in the second quarter of a 23-15 win over the Rams on Monday night, Tagovailoa tried to bring down Los Angeles linebacker Christian Rozeboom, who had come down with the interception. Rozeboom was running along the sideline on his return when Tagovailoa lowered his shoulder and took a knee to the side of the head. The Miami signal-caller ended up being just fine, even sharing a few light moments with reporters following the game when asked about the tackle. “I went up to that dude that intercepted me and asked him, ‘Like bro, you couldn’t (of) just ran out of bounds or like cut back?’ … He told me after the game, he’s like, ‘There’s no room, there was nowhere else to go,’” Tagovailoa said. “He gotta do what he gotta do to help his team win games. “I wasn’t planning on using my head to go hit him, so.” Throughout his explanation of how things went down, Tagovailoa couldn’t stop smiling, even laughing at times—because what could possibly be funnier than another traumatic brain injury, right?  Dolphins coaches need to start getting some of the blame here, too. To continuously let Tagovailoa go out there and throw himself headfirst at opposing defenses is just plain irresponsible.  It needs to be made clear to Tagovailoa that he quite literally cannot suffer another concussion. Not only would that one likely be career-ending, but it could also be life-altering, both mentally and physically. Surely these conversations have been had—or at least we hope that’s the case—but it looks like the message still hasn’t gotten through. Something tells us we haven’t seen Tagovailoa get knocked out for the last time. The saddest part? No one is going to intervene. Miami isn’t going to bench the 26-year-old, and the NFL certainly isn’t going to step in. For a league that says it cares so much about the health of its players, here’s a chance to possibly save one, and all it’s going to do is look the other way. We obviously hope Tagovailoa cleans up his game in such a way that will prevent a major head injury from ever happening again. But when he—and everyone else around him—seemsly embraces recklessness, it feels like another disaster is bound to happen.

After missing the preseason and first nine games of the regular season, Joel Embiid is set to suit up for the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday for the first time in 2024-25. That’s arguably the greatest area of intrigue at the dawn of the NBA Cup, an in-season tournament that will contest group play on Tuesdays and Fridays from today through Dec. 3 to decide an elimination bracket later that month. We look at the start of the event as well as a showdown between NHL Eastern Conference contenders and a juicy piece of college football MACtion. Let’s go. Embiid may have returned sooner from a left knee injury, but he racked up a three-game suspension for shoving a Philadelphia Inquirer columnist. The transgression? Name-dropping Embiid’s son and late brother in a column, calling into question his ability to stay in shape. Now the star center gets the chance to take out frustration on a Knicks team that eliminated Philly from the playoffs last season. Embiid likely will be on a minutes restriction, but his track record for efficiency and the struggling Sixers’ urgency could equal instant contribution. Limited to 39 games last season due to injury, Embiid shot 52.9 percent—including 38.8 percent from deep—while averaging a career-best 34.7 points.

The same Huskies who upset then-No. 5 Notre Dame in September had since lost three conference games. Their triumph over the Broncos tightened the sprint for a spot in the league championship game in Detroit on Dec. 7, which goes to the top two schools in the MAC. Western Michigan and Bowling Green are among four teams with one loss, with two others one game behind. Unfortunately for the Broncos, the NIU game wasn’t an anomaly for the defense. Western Michigan has permitted at least 24 points in four of its five conference contests. The Huskies gained 255 of their 411 yards on the ground while throwing just three incompletions. Now comes a Bowling Green attack that features the MAC’s top receiver in Harold Fannin Jr. (73 catches, 1,033 yards, six touchdowns) and averages 378.1 yards—slightly behind Western Michigan’s league-best 406.8. Connor Bazelak has passed for 2,022 yards, third most in the conference, and will oppose a counterpart in the Broncos’ Hayden Wolff, who’ll be primed for a rebound. Expect offense aplenty.

After suffering a 35-6 loss to then-No. 6 Penn State last Saturday in the Nittany Lions' annual white-out game in University Park, Pa., Washington will return home for its own black-out night when they take on UCLA (4-5 overall, 3-4 Big Ten) on Friday in Seattle. The usually purple-clad Huskies (5-5, 3-4) instead will don black uniforms, and fans are also encouraged to wear black. ""Some great uniforms coming out,"" Washington coach Jedd Fisch said. ""So excited about that."" The Huskies this season have played in a black-out at Rutgers (Sept. 27), a stripe-out at Iowa (Oct. 12) and a red-out at Indiana (Oct. 26) before last Saturday's white-out. They lost all of those games, although they are 5-0 at Husky Stadium. Washington likely needs to defeat UCLA to become bowl eligible as its last game of the regular season is Nov. 30 at No. 1 Oregon. The Huskies have had a short turnaround after not getting back to Seattle until 5 a.m. Sunday following their game at Penn State. ""Short week, a little bit of a cram session,"" Fisch said. ""But as I told the staff, ‘Sleep Saturday.'"" Quarterback Will Rogers is expected to start against UCLA after getting benched at halftime last weekend for Demond Williams Jr.  ""Will was a victim of circumstances, a little bit,"" Fisch said. ""He was 10-for-13 in the first half, just we weren't able to get anything going."" The Bruins have won three in a row, including a 20-17 decision against visiting Iowa last Friday. They have games remaining against rival Southern California and Fresno State as they try to qualify for a bowl game. The win over the Hawkeyes was UCLA's first in four tries at the Rose Bowl this season. ""I didn't want to make too big of a deal about us being back home, but we kind of treated this game like a road game,"" Bruins coach Deshaun Foster said. ""I just think my guys, they came out and they earned the right to win. Just in how they practiced (last) week and I think as long as we continue to do that, this team can really just take off."" UCLA quarterback Ethan Garbers started his collegiate career at Washington in 2020 -- he was named the Huskies' offensive scout squad MVP -- before transferring to Westwood the next year.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Louisiana won its most recent game, however the Ragin' Cajuns coach wasn't totally satisfied. Both teams are focused on early-season improvement ahead of their game Wednesday night in Houston. Houston (1-1) dropped to No. 8 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll after a 74-69 home loss to then-No. 11 Auburn last Saturday. The Cougars opened the season with a 97-40 victory against outmanned Jackson State, prompting coach Kelvin Sampson to say that he wanted his team to be challenged in its second game. ""This team needed to be tested,"" Sampson said. ""That's why we scheduled the game. You have wins and losses, but you also have wisdom and learning. This was a learning night for us."" Sampson said his team had its lofty ranking because of its ""rebounding and transition defense."" But those areas weren't advantages against the lengthy and athletic Tigers. Auburn outscored Houston 14-10 in fast-break points, including a 12-3 edge while it outscored the Cougars 46-36 in the second half. The teams each had 33 rebounds. ""We got exposed in some areas that we've got to go back and figure out how we can get better and clean up some things,"" Sampson said. ""This is a great learning tool for us. We weren't very good offensively in a lot of ways, but their defense had a lot to do with that. ""We hope we can learn from a loss to a really good team. There is no shame on our side."" J'Wan Roberts was one of five Houston players to score in double figures. He finished with 12 points along with seven rebounds. ""I don't think this game defines our season,"" Roberts said. ""When we look at the film there's a lot of stuff we've got to work on to try and get better for the next game."" The next game is against Louisiana (1-1), which defeated visiting UT Dallas 82-65 last Thursday. ""We showed some inconsistency,"" Ragin' Cajuns coach Bob Marlin said. ""It's a learning process. We had our moments each half offensively and defensively. And then the second half I thought we did a pretty good job pressuring the ball and defensively we got off to a better start."" Marlin said his team had too many unforced errors among its 14 turnovers and he was ""really disappointed"" in its 3-point shooting (4 of 21). ""We've got to do a better job of shooting the ball,"" Marlin said, but he added that his team's shortcomings were overcome by preventing its opponent from taking full advantage. UT Dallas, which made 7 of 28 3-pointers, turned the ball over 24 times and Louisiana had a 30-9 advantage in points off turnovers. ""(The Ragin' Cajuns) are disappointed because they know they're better than they played,"" Marlin said, ""but we're still growing as a team."" The game against Houston will be a far greater challenge for Louisiana, which opened the season with a 70-66 home loss to Kent State on Nov. 4. ""We'll learn more when we go to Houston,"" Marlin said. ""It'll be a super tough game. They're one of the most physical teams in the country, if not the most physical."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

UConn coach Danny Hurley said he will be looking for a better effort than the one his team put forth in Saturday night's 92-53 victory over New Hampshire. The Huskies (2-0) held just an 11-point halftime lead in that game.   ""I said to those guys in the locker room, ‘You won by 39 points, but the reality of the situation is that game was below brand for us for a considerable amount of time,'"" Hurley said. ""The standard is high here. That was clearly a below-standard performance for us in a number of ways, in particular on-ball defense. ... I thought there were some good things, but for the most part it was a frustrating game.   ""We've got some young guys who are gonna get better defensively who right now are not good defensive players. These games early in the year are important to learn lessons and develop and get better.""   Senior forward Alex Karaban has led the Huskies in scoring in each of their first two games. He had 20 points in a 92-56 season-opening victory against Sacred Heart and 17 versus New Hampshire. He's averaging 5.5 assists and 5.5 blocks per game.   ""Alex is playing the way a Big East Player of the Year is supposed to be playing from a statistical standpoint, an efficiency standpoint, but he's also been super vocal and doing everything we want him to do right now,"" Hurley said.    Le Moyne (1-2) is in its second season as a Division I program. The Dolphins moved from Division II to the Northeast Conference before last season. Le Moyne opened its season with an 86-82 loss to Syracuse and a 97-75 setback to Cal State Northridge before rebounding to record a 107-73 victory over Division III SUNY Poly on Saturday.   Injuries have prevented Le Moyne from having its complete team available for a game this season. Guard AJ Dancler missed the Dolphins' first two games, and guard Robby Carmody -- who began his career at Notre Dame -- played in the loss to Syracuse but has missed the past two games with a leg injury. In addition, fifth-year guard Darrick Jones Jr. missed the Syracuse game, but came off the bench against Northridge.   ""At the end of the day we have to do a better job defensively and we know that,"" Le Moyne coach Nate Champion said following Saturday's win. ""We have to continue to get better as a team defensively and buy-in to that mindset.   ""(UConn is) a really good team. Hopefully we'll be ready to go. Hopefully we can perform at a high level again.""   Dwayne Koroma, a 6-foot-8 forward who started his career at Iona after being recruited by Rick Pitino, led the Dolphins with 17 points and six rebounds against SUNY Poly.    ""I think we're building the right culture here,"" Koroma said. ""I think we have a super-selfless group of guys. Everybody plays for each other.   ""A lot of (people) didn't expect us to have the performance we had against Syracuse, either. It doesn't matter if we're banged up or not, we're going to play as hard as we can and try to come out with a win.""   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

After Vancouver's most recent outing, which continued the club's home-ice struggles, the Canucks could use it. Lekkerimaki, who was selected 15th overall in that draft, will be counted on to provide some of the scoring punch lost with Brock Boeser on the shelf due to a suspected concussion.  Lekkerimaki, 20, collected five goals and two assists in seven games for Abbotsford of the American Hockey League before being summoned. He practiced on a line with J.T. Miller and Pius Suter on Monday. ""I'm not nervous right now, but probably get (nervous) the same day or a few hours before the game,"" Lekkerimaki said. ""I will just try to play my game. But at the same time, the first NHL game is special, so try to enjoy it, too. Just have fun and enjoy every second, on and off the ice."" The Canucks, who have only one win in six home games (1-2-3), saw their three-game winning streak snapped by a 7-3 thrashing from the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday. Struggling forward Elias Pettersson registered his first multi-point performance of the season with one goal and one assist. The Canucks likely will turn to goaltender Arturs Silovs, who had some mop-up duty after Kevin Lankinen surrendered all seven goals. ""We wanted to get him in a game and we'll go from there,"" coach Rick Tocchet said.  The Flames arrive after skating to a 3-1 win over the Los Angeles Kings at home on Monday night. ""There was a lot of good from a lot of players. There's not a lot I can be overly critical of. It was a pretty solid 60 minutes,"" coach Ryan Huska said. Goaltender Dustin Wolf turned in a sparkling 28-save performance. His shutout bid was quashed in the final minutes, but the victory was a solid effort through the lineup. ""I think everyone, as a whole, just shut them down,"" Wolf said. ""Any chances they had, I was able to see, for the most part. I'm just trying to help keep pucks out of our net and if we score one more than they do, then we're going to be in pretty good hands."" The Flames finished a three-game Eastern road swing before returning home to face the Kings. While it will be a mean feat to rack up another victory on the West Coast, Calgary did show the blueprint in beating the Kings. The Flames controlled play from the start, were rewarded offensively and continued to hold momentum with a patient game that included a smart forecheck. ""We needed to start on time and be all over them, and that's what we did. Doing that all over them wears them down,"" forward Jonathan Huberdeau said. ""Scoring two quick goals and taking advantage (of the first period edge in play), we deserved it the way we were working. We needed to capitalize, and that's what we did, and after that, we didn't look back."" Calgary won the first meeting of the season between the Pacific Division rivals, a 6-5 overtime clash to open the season, in a game in which the Flames trailed 3-0 midway through the first period.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

After a disappointing loss to Austin Peay their last time out, Bulldogs coach Thad Matta inserted Augusto Cassia into the starting line-up looking for a quick start, and he responded with a career high 16. Butler was also looking to cut down on turnovers after committing 35 in their first two games. Butler only committed 11 on the night. Donovan Williams led Western Michigan with 17 points and nine rebounds, while teammate JaVaughn Hannah chipped in 15 points. The Broncos shot 4-for-22 from 3-point range. Western Michigan opened with five straight points to start the contest with Hannah hitting a fall-away jumper and a 3-pointer from the wing. That would be the Broncos biggest lead of the night. Still, the first half saw the teams trading baskets. The game was tied 11 times in the first half and saw seven lead changes. Butler led 39-37 at halftime. The Bulldogs opened the second half hot. Cassia started things with a dunk on an alley-oop. Finley Bizjack added a driving basket and the Bulldogs went on a 16-2 run over a four-minute span to make it 55-39.

The Stars' six-goal first period tied the then-Minnesota North Stars, who also scored six in the first 20 minutes in a 7-2 win over the Los Angeles Kings on March 16, 1971. The half-dozen goals that got past Joel Blomqvist and Alex Nedeljkovic on just 12 shots were also the most Pittsburgh ever allowed in the first period at home. Five Stars players recorded two or more points in the barrage, with Marchment (one goal, three assists) tying a team record with four points in one period. That occurred 10 times previously, with Tyler Seguin and Valeri Nichushkin both accomplishing the feat most recently against Philadelphia on Dec. 7, 2013. Canadiens 7, Sabres 5 Montreal outlasted host Buffalo with two-goal efforts from Cole Caufield and Nick Suzuki, while Suzuki added two assists and Juraj Slafkovsky tallied three assists. Caufield helped put an end to the Canadiens' six-game losing skid as he struck on the power play with 7:02 left in the third period to record his second goal of the contest and the eventual game-winner. Sabres star Tage Thompson scored his team-leading 11th goal of the season, but left the game early in the second period with a lower-body injury. Flyers 4, Sharks 3 (SO) Matvei Michkov and Travis Konecny both scored in regulation and again in the shootout as Philadelphia wasted a three-goal lead before prevailing over visiting San Jose. Erik Johnson also scored while Samuel Ersson made 28 saves for the Flyers, who are 2-0-1 in their past three games. Michkov, a healthy scratch in each of the previous two games, finished with a goal and an assist before his shootout tally. Jack Thompson, Mikael Granlund and Barclay Goodrow scored for the Sharks, who had won five of their previous seven games. William Eklund logged two assists, Granlund added an assist and Vitek Vanecek made 40 saves for San Jose. Hurricanes 5, Golden Knights 2 Jordan Staal, Eric Robinson and Jesperi Kotkaniemi each had a goal and an assist as Carolina handed Vegas its first home loss of the season, prevailing in Las Vegas. Tyson Jost and Jordan Martinook also scored goals for the Hurricanes, who picked up their ninth win in the past 10 games. Pyotr Kochetkov made 30 saves. Jack Eichel had a goal and an assist and Ivan Barbashev also scored for Vegas, which had a franchise-record-tying eight-game home winning streak snapped. Adin Hill stopped 17 of 21 shots before being replaced by Akira Schmid, who finished with 12 saves in his Golden Knights debut. Avalanche 3, Predators 2 (OT) Samuel Girard scored at 2:47 of overtime as Colorado beat Nashville in Denver. Mikko Rantanen and Devon Toews also scored and Alexandar Georgiev turned away 29 shots for the Avalanche, who have won two in a row.

""I thought we played well (against the Lions), coming out of the half we figured it out and ... that says a lot about the young men in that locker room,"" said Northern Arizona coach Shane Burcar, whose team was led by Trent McLaughlin's 30 points. Playing Stanford on the road will be a challenge, as the Cardinal are coming off home routs of Division I opponents Denver and Cal State Fullerton.

Gealer, a junior, scored all of his points in the second half while making six 3-pointers. Blakes is a graduate transfer from Duke who also had five assists with no turnovers. Cal State Fullerton mustered only two assists in the game while committing 14 turnovers. ""Really pleased with the way our guys competed,"" Stanford first-year coach Kyle Smith said. ""We were relentless defensively I felt the whole game. Holding a team to two assists is just good. Period. ""I'd say that's part of our identity. When we get tired, we gotta defend, we gotta create an identity. We're gonna be stingy."" Gealer leads Stanford with an average of 16 points a game.

Cleveland continued the best start in franchise history with its 12th victory in as many games. The Cavaliers trailed by nine points in the third quarter but recovered to keep coach Kenny Atkinson unblemished in his first season on the Cavaliers' bench. Mitchell drilled seven 3-pointers and had eight rebounds. The Bulls shot 49.4 percent but committed 21 turnovers leading to 35 Cavaliers points. Zach LaVine tied the game at 106-106 before the Cavaliers scored 13 of the game's last 20 points. LaVine led six Bulls players in double figures with 26 points. Spurs 116, Kings 96 Victor Wembanyama amassed 34 points and 14 rebounds to lead San Antonio past visiting Sacramento, which was playing the second game of a road back-to-back and was outscored 56-41 in the second half. Wembanyama was 13 of 22 from the field, including 6 of 12 from 3-point range, and made both of his free throws. Wembanyama added six assists, three blocks and one steal. Julian Champagnie added 13 points for the Spurs. De'Aaron Fox led the Kings with 24 points while Domantas Sabonis racked up 23 points and 11 boards and DeMar DeRozan scored 21 points. Nets 107, Pelicans 105 Cam Thomas scored 17 points, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 32.9 seconds remaining, and visiting Brooklyn handed New Orleans its fifth consecutive defeat. Cameron Johnson and Noah Clowney added 15 points each and Dennis Schroder scored 14 as seven Nets scored in double figures. Brandon Ingram scored 24 and rookie Yves Missi added a season-high 17 points and 11 rebounds for the Pelicans. Javonte Green missed a 3-point attempt that would have tied the game in the final seconds. Thunder 134, Clippers 128 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored a career-high 45 points to lead host Oklahoma City, playing its first game without Chet Holmgren (pelvic fracture), to a win over Los Angeles. Jalen Williams logged 28 points and eight rebounds for the Thunder, who improved to 3-0 this season on the second night of a back-to-back. The Clippers had their four-game winning streak end despite getting 31 points from Norman Powell plus 22 points and 14 rebounds from Ivica Zubac. Rockets 107, Wizards 92 Alperen Sengun produced his eighth double-double and helped Houston fend off a fourth-quarter charge from visiting Washington. Sengun paired 27 points with 17 rebounds to pace the Rockets, who overcame the absence of point guard Fred VanVleet (hamstring). Houston recorded only 13 assists, relying on transition opportunities (23 fast-break points) and a dominant performance from Sengun in the paint to survive. Kyle Kuzma scored eight points during an 11-4 Wizards run that opened the fourth and cut the deficit to 86-80. Following a Houston timeout, Sengun converted a dunk and a driving layup before nailing a 3-pointer to help the Rockets reclaim control and a double-digit lead at 93-80. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

The Ducks (2-0) beat UC Riverside and Montana by an average of 23 points, including a 79-48 smackdown of Montana on Friday. Oregon coach Dana Altman, in his 15th season at the school, wasn't about to get excited over two early-season wins. ""A lot of things to learn about being a good basketball team and making teams work,"" Altman said after the win over the Grizzlies. ""But it's Nov. 8 and we've got a lot of new guys. Just got a lot of work to do."" Oregon's scoring has been balanced with five players averaging in double digits. Nate Bittle leads the squad in scoring (16.5 ppg) and rebounding (10.5 per game). Kwame Evans Jr. is averaging 14.5 points and 6.5 rebounds, and he is followed by TJ Bamba (13 points per game), Brandon Angel (12) and Jadrian Tracey (10). Bamba is in his first campaign with the Ducks after playing three seasons for Washington State and last season at Villanova. He is focused on developing chemistry within the squad. ""I feel like with all my teammates I somewhat have connections,"" Bamba said, ""but it's still got to improve."" Oregon held Montana to 34 percent shooting from the field and forced the Grizzlies into 14 turnovers. Bittle was the key performer with 17 points and nine rebounds. The Ducks are 51-10 all-time against the Pilots, including a 78-56 victory on Dec. 17, 2022, in the latest matchup. Portland (1-1) opened the season by beating NAIA program Lewis & Clark before being routed 94-53 by visiting UC Santa Barbara on Saturday.

Chris Austin had just five points on 2-of-10 shooting on Saturday during a contest in which Portland shot 30.3 percent from the field and a measly 5 of 31 (16.1 percent) from 3-point range. ""What we try to do is get up on the floor and play fast,"" Portland coach Shantay Legans told reporters prior to the season. ""... The best players should get the most shots on the team.""

And they came through it successfully. They're in a confident place."" Two early wins against outmatched competition have the Hawkeyes off to a good start. Iowa will go for three in a row Tuesday night when South Dakota visits Iowa City. Iowa is coming off an 89-74 home decision Thursday night over Southern in which the Hawkeyes drilled 18 3-pointers, their highest total in a game since the 2022 Big Ten tournament and matching for the fifth most during McCaffery's 15 years. Pryce Sandfort came off the bench to hit 6 of 8 from long distance and score a game-high 22 points. Older brother Payton Sandfort added 17 points, stuffing the stat sheet with eight rebounds and seven assists (though he committed six turnovers). He leads five Hawkeyes in double figures so far at 18.5 points per game. The trip to Iowa will represent a big step up in class for the Coyotes (3-0), who are coming off a 77-47 rout Sunday of NAIA opponent Mount Marty (S.D.). Shey Eberwein came off the bench to score a game-high 15 points for South Dakota, which established a 40-22 halftime lead and never looked back. Four players are averaging in double figures for the Coyotes, who were picked to finish seventh in the nine-team Summit League. Northwestern State transfer Chase Forte is leading the way at 14.7 ppg and Isaac Bruns is chipping 12 ppg. Third-year coach Eric Peterson said Forte has been a good addition to his roster. ""He's hard-nosed. He'll D you up and is an extremely good passer,"" Peterson said. ""He can get two feet in the paint. He's a tough guy."" The Hawkeyes are 12-0 all-time against South Dakota.

Utah drained 19 3-pointers in each of its first two games, a 100-59 blowout of Alcorn State and a 98-63 rout of Central Arkansas. ""I'm proud of how we've been able to adapt and adjust to get through these two games,"" Utes coach Craig Smith said.

The Utes are leading the nation in 3-point makes per game as well as 3-point attempts per game (44.0) and are 17th nationally in scoring (99 ppg). In the Central Arkansas win, guard Gabe Madsen eclipsed the 1,000-point mark for his Utah career. Madsen is averaging 26 points per game in the young season. His twin brother, Mason, a transfer from Boston College, is adding 15.0 ppg. Queens (2-0) is also off to a strong start.

Queens is 0-3 all-time against power conference foes, with defeats against Nebraska, Clemson and Duke. Leonard has spoken positively of his young team's offensive execution.

The transfer from Indiana State is averaging 20 points in his first two games with Xavier, scoring 21 and 19 points in two home wins. Jackson State is playing its third straight road game to open the season and will be looking for its first win after falling to High Point 80-71 on Saturday. While Xavier has improved its offensive rebounding since the first 20 minutes of its season, it is trying to do the same with its 3-point defense. The Musketeers surrendered six offensive rebounds that turned into 10 second-chance points in the first half of their opener against Texas Southern, falling behind by as many as nine points. Since that point, Xavier has won the rebounding battle 45-38, allowing only 11 second-chance points. The problem for Xavier has been its defense against the 3-point shot. Texas Southern and IU Indy went a combined 24 of 51 from beyond the arc. IU Indy drained 14 of its 28 shots from long distance Friday as Xavier struggled to put the Jaguars away. ""We have to get better on our end defending the 3-point shot,"" Xavier coach Sean Miller said. ""We have to fix the leak in the roof and be better in that area. When you give up 14 of 28 from three, that's a concern."" After getting blown out 97-40 at No. 4 Houston in its season opener Nov. 4, Jackson State rebounded with a more respectable effort on the road at High Point, N.C., on Saturday.

As a Tuesday visit from Southeastern Louisiana looms, Mississippi State has scored at least 95 points in consecutive games to begin the season for the first time in school history. Five Bulldogs scored in double figures during a 101-66 rout of Georgia State on Friday. In that contest, three players made their first career starts for Mississippi State, which is growing in a new philosophy under third-year coach Chris Jans. ""I want our team to play and get great shots and put pressure on the defense and score early when we can,"" Jans said. ""But on the other end, if we don't turn them over, I want them to have to go all the way to the shot=clock (buzzer) and work for open looks. ""The difference in length of possessions offensively and defensively is way more important to me than when people talk about what our pace is."" The Bulldogs drilled 10 3-pointers against Georgia State while boasting a 54-24 scoring edge in the paint. Josh Hubbard scored a team-high 15 points and Riley Kugel followed with 14. Hubbard, who shot 3-for-6 from long range, has made at least one 3-pointer in 15 straight games. Tuesday marks the second game of a 10-game road trip for Southeastern Louisiana. A 14-0 run in the first half at UAB on Sunday helped the Lions take a 10-point lead, but they couldn't hold the momentum. The Blazers responded with a 12-1 run to close the half en route to a 82-72 victory. Jakevion Buckley sparked Southeastern Louisiana (1-1) with 16 points and freshman Jeremy Elyzee posted his first career double-double, contributing 14 points and 10 rebounds. The Lions blasted visiting William Carey, an NAIA school, 91-53 on Nov. 4 but aren't set to return home until Dec. 20 against Loyola New Orleans.

The Horned Frogs and Bobcats had a triple-overtime thriller in their last meeting on Nov. 24, 2009, with TCU prevailing 108-99. TCU (2-0) has improved its program significantly since then, as it has made it to the NCAA Tournament in each of the previous three seasons under Jamie Dixon. TCU is hoping to make a fourth straight with wins over Florida A&M and Florida Gulf Coast already under its belt.  The Horned Frogs have become consistent winners early in seasons, too, posting a 53-6 record in the month of November since the 2014-15 campaign. TCU's offense shined in its season-opening victory over Florida A&M (105-59), while the defense received much of the credit in its 67-51 victory over Florida Gulf Coast. ""We found a way to get it done defensively, rebounding-wise, got all of our defensive goals, our standards, so that's a good sign,"" Dixon said after the victory over Florida Gulf Coast. ""Offensively, just not very good early and it wasn't like missing shots. It's just (that) our decision-making wasn't great."" Sophomore guard Vasean Allette has come off the bench to lead the Horned Frogs in scoring in each of the first two games, averaging 17.0 points per contest. For Texas State (2-0), this will be its first road game of the season. The Bobcats went 5-11 on the road last year. Sophomore guard Kaden Gumbs has led the team in scoring the first two games, scoring 15 points against Eastern Michigan and 27 points against McMurry. Guard Drue Drinnon is another player to watch and is an outside threat, knocking down five 3-pointers in the last game against McMurry. As a team, Texas State improved its field-goal percentage from 41.7 against Eastern Michigan to 56.7 vs. McMurry. Asked about the improvement on offense, Bobcats coach Terrence Johnson said, ""It's a good pass, which is usually going to be a good shot.

The Longhorns bounced back from a season-opening loss to Ohio State in Las Vegas with an empathic 90-59 home win over Houston Christian on Friday. Johnson led the way for Texas with 28 points and now has racked up a combined 57 points in his first two collegiate games. Texas (1-1) never trailed against Houston Christian. The Longhorns were up by seven at halftime but roared out of the break, scoring the first 12 points of the second half as part of a 24-2 run to begin the second half. Johnson hit two 3-pointers and had 10 points in that pivotal spurt while Texas' defense held the visitors to 2-of-12 shooting over the first nine minutes of the half and won its 23rd consecutive home-opening game. ""We were able to get out and play to our strengths, which is to get out, play fast in transition, put pressure on the basket and let our guys get a chance to play a little bit in open space,"" Texas coach Rodney Terry said afterward. Arthur Kaluma added 15 points, Chendall Weaver had 12, Jordan Pope scored 11, and Kadin Shedrick and Jayson Kent hit for 10 points each for the Longhorns  in Friday's victory. Texas is still without guard Tramon Mark, who has missed the first two games with an ankle injury and has no specific timeline for a return. Johnson continues to wow, as expected for the presumptive one-and-done guard. He said the team's intense summer workouts have helped him adapt quickly to the college game. ""I feel like my adjustments have mainly been in practice, working against other good players, older players,"" Johnson said. ""It's just been playing off my teammates, letting it come to me, and shooting the open shot."" Johnson is 21 of 38 from the floor and 10 of 18 from 3-point range over his first two games. By comparison, former Texas one-and-done player Kevin Durant scored 20 and 21 points, respectively, in his first two collegiate contests. ""Tre is one of those guys that I think every game, every day, he's just getting better and better,"" Terry explained. ""It's really about developing a pro mentality.""

Gabe Spinelli led Chicago State with 15 points in Saturday's setback while Jalen Forrest had 11 and Saxby Sunderland and Cam Jernigan added 10 points each.

In its strong start, with wins over two mid-majors, Clemson has yet to trail. In the Tigers' 88-62 win on Friday over Saint Francis (Pa.), Ian Schieffelin had 16 points and 13 rebounds while Jaeden Zackery delivered 16 points, six assists and four steals. Zackery, who averaged double-figure scoring for each of the past three years at Boston College, has excelled at both ends of the floor. On Friday, when Clemson coach Brad Brownell said he thought his team ""had some guys that just didn't play quite as hard,"" he also singled out Zackery for his effort. ""Jaeden Zackery was terrific all night,"" Brownell said. ""I thought his on-ball defense was really good."" Zackery's presence at the point has allowed backcourt mate Chase Hunter to focus on scoring. Hunter leads the Tigers with an average of 15 points per game, hitting 57.9 percent from the floor and 5 of 9 from beyond the arc (55.6 percent). Eastern Kentucky counters with its top scorer, George Kimble III, a transfer from Division II Eckerd College, who is averaging 18 points and 4.5 assists per game. Jordan Crawford, a transfer from College of Charleston, is averaging 14.5 points per game. Devontae Blanton, who entered the year 12th on the school's all-time scoring list, is putting up 14 points, 5.5 rebounds and five assists per game. As Eastern Kentucky awaits the renovation of its home arena, the Colonels are playing a heavy road schedule.

Syracuse, which was picked to finish 11th in the 18-team Atlantic Coast Conference under second-year head coach Adrian Autry, fended off Le Moyne's upset bid despite shooting just 43.1 percent (31 of 72) from the field, including 18.2 percent (4 of 22) from 3-point land.

UCLA (2-1) returned home after a disappointing loss to New Mexico in Henderson, Nev., on Friday, after which Bruins coach Mick Cronin called out his team for its turnover troubles. UCLA committed 15 giveaways on Monday but offset them with its stifling defense.  The Bruins converted Boston University's turnovers into 36 points. UCLA also dominated the interior, outscoring the Terriers 34-10 in the paint.  Stefanovic went 3-for-5 from 3-point range on a night UCLA collectively struggled from beyond the arc, going just 5-for-22 as a team. Sebastian Mack chipped in 12 points for the Bruins. Mack was a player Cronin specifically mentioned as someone who struggled offensively against New Mexico. Mack responded by committing no turnovers against the Terriers.  Boston University (0-3) was 6-for-24 from long distance, led by its only double-figure scorer, Kyrone Alexander. Alexander made 2 of 6 triples en route to 10 points. The Terriers were not much more successful inside the 3-point arc, going 8-for-22 on 2-point field-goal attempts. With its inability to get good looks from inside, Boston University also failed to get to the free-throw line often.  The Terriers attempted nine foul shots, making six. UCLA, meanwhile, went 18-for-21 at the free-throw line.  It was a blowout from the start, with the Bruins racing out to a 21-7 lead on Mack's 3-pointer with 11:24 left in the first half.  The visitors were later within nine, 28-19, following a pair of free throws from Nico Nobili with 2:56 to go, but UCLA then rattled off nine unanswered points to blow the game open. The Bruins went into the break up 39-22.  UCLA opened the second half on an 11-0 run, then led by at least 20 the rest of the way.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

The Knights (2-0) began the season with consecutive home wins, upsetting then-No. 13 Texas A&M 64-61 on Nov. 4 before rallying to beat an experienced Purdue Fort Wayne team 75-68 on Friday to give coach Johnny Dawkins his 150th career win at UCF. Florida Atlantic (2-0) has started quickly under first-year coach John Jakus, nearly hitting the century mark in each of its first two games. After a season-opening 97-64 win over Indiana State on Nov. 4, the Owls blasted NAIA foe Coastal Georgia 99-49 on Friday. With Florida Atlantic coming to town, Dawkins is trying to focus on building team chemistry since 11 newcomers are on the UCF roster this season. Among the fresh faces is former UTSA guard Jordan Ivy-Curry, who went for 18 points against Purdue Fort Wayne. George Mason transfer Keyshawn Hall had 14 points and 12 boards in the victory, while true freshman Moustapha Thiam chipped in 13 points and six rebounds. ""I'm still learning about these guys. This is our second game -- including exhibition games, this is our fourth game,"" Dawkins said following the meeting with Purdue Fort Wayne. ""When you have that many new players, I'm still learning about what they're like in games."" Jakus can relate, as the Owls lost 10 players from last season's 25-win team. Jackson State transfer Ken Evans Jr. and Louisville transfer Kaleb Glenn scored 18 points apiece against Coastal Georgia. Florida Atlantic has outrebounded opponents 98-62 through its first two games, but the Owls realize that the Knights pose quite the challenge on the glass. ""UCF is a very big team. They got some big guards, so one through five has to hit (the boards),"" Florida Atlantic forward Tre Carroll said. The Knights lead the all-time series between the teams 22-10. However, Florida Atlantic has taken five of its past seven games against UCF. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

The Yellow Jackets (1-1) allowed North Florida to shoot a sizzling 53.6 percent from the floor en route to a 105-93 setback to the Ospreys on Sunday. The contest marked the first time Georgia Tech surrendered 100 points in a game since a four-overtime loss to Georgia State, 123-120, in the 2020-21 season opener. ""It's a weird game from the standpoint of we scored the ball, but we just couldn't stop them at all,"" Yellow Jackets head coach Damon Stoudamire said. ""We gotta go back to the drawing board. I'm not disappointed by any means. It's still early. We just got some things we need to address. I'm bent out of shape by losing, I'm mad about losing, but we'll get past this and we gotta get ready for the next game."" Georgia Tech's Luke O'Brien downplayed his 15-point, eight-rebound performance and instead told reporters that he felt his team's defense was ""pretty pathetic."" Baye Ndongo recorded his seventh career double-double for the Yellow Jackets, posting team highs in points (20) and rebounds (10) on Sunday. Javian McCollum followed up his 18-point effort in Georgia Tech's 85-62 victory over West Georgia on Wednesday with 14 more vs. North Florida. Texas Southern (1-2) also was rather generous in its last game, a 92-64 setback to Georgia on Sunday in a Peach State Classic contest in Athens, Ga. Kenny Hunter scored 16 points on 8-of-12 shooting from the floor for Texas Southern, and Kavion McClain added 13 while making 6 of 8 shots. However, the rest of the Tigers combined to go 10-for-45 (22.2 percent) from the field. What's worse, the entire team made just 1 of 19 attempts from 3-point range and was outrebounded by a 53-23 margin. Despite the Tigers' struggles with their shooting, Georgia Bulldogs coach Mike White was quick to credit their aggressiveness on defense. ""Texas Southern's really physical, very, very handsy, tipped a lot of balls,"" White said. ""They were just super active.

The Seminoles (2-0) have that opportunity when they host Tarleton State (0-2) in Tallahassee, Fla. The Texans have lost their two games by 34 and 29 points, and they face their second Atlantic Coast Conference opponent, after losing at SMU 96-62 to open the season. Tarleton State then fell to visiting Sam Houston State 91-62. Florida State is coming off a 73-65 win over Rice in Houston on Saturday. Jamir Watkins scored 17 of his 30 points in the second half for the Seminoles, who never trailed but had to play solid defense down the stretch to hold off the Owls. Florida State's depth and defense, which have been staples of coach Leonard Hamilton's most successful teams, were on display as nine players got on the scoresheet and 12 received playing time. The Seminoles' defense totaled nine steals and seven blocks while scoring 23 points off Rice's 17 turnovers. ""You know, up north, you don't really play defense like how we play down here, especially at Florida State,"" said Florida State big man Taylor Bol Bowen, a native of Vermont. ""It's more packed line and a little bit softer, and I definitely always got blocks and stuff, but just being more active on the ball and using my length was something that they taught me and developed here."" Tarleton State coach Billy Gillispie shook things up with a couple of lineup changes against Sam Houston State, as Izzy Miles and Joseph Martinez each started. However, the result wasn't much different. Bubu Benjamin led the Texans again, finishing with 17 points and a career-high 10 rebounds for his first collegiate double-double. The sophomore scored a career-best 21 in the opener. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Nashville defenseman Brady Skeji had the puck just inside the blueline in the Colorado zone but lost an edge. Girard took the puck, skated in on Juuse Saros ahead of Skeji and scored over Saros' blocker to win it. It was his first goal of the season, and he also added an assist on the night. Mikko Rantanen and Devon Toews also scored and Alexandar Georgiev turned away 29 shots for the Avalanche, who have won two in a row. Luke Evangelista and Colton Sissons scored for the Predators and Saros finished with 29 saves. Georgiev allowed an early goal for the second straight game but then kept Nashville off the board for the next two periods. The Predators got that goal 1:45 during a delayed penalty. Juuso Parssinen took a shot from the point that Georgiev stopped but Evangelista scooped the rebound and tapped it in for his second goal of the season. It stayed that way until the second period. Four seconds after Nashville killed off Zachary L'Heureux's minor, Toews took a shot from the point that deflected off a Predators stick and by Saros at 4:32. It was the first goal of the season for Toews. The Avalanche took the lead midway through the second when Joel Kiviranta had the puck at the top of the slot, passed it to Rantanen in the right circle, and his one-timer beat Saros to the short side at 11:37. It was his ninth of the season and the second straight game with a goal. Nashville tied it up in the first minute of the final period. Roman Josi stole the puck at the Colorado blueline, skated into the zone and fed Sissons with a pass to the side of the crease. Sissons slid it into a wide-open net at 59 seconds.

The 54-year-old Boston native was joined in the Class of 2024 by ex-NHL players Pavel Datsyuk and Shea Weber, women's stars Natalie Darwitz and Krissy Wendell-Pohl, and executives Colin Campbell and David Poile. Roenick composed himself at the start of his speech before saying, ""I love this game. It's been such a huge part of my life for most of my life and this is the best way I can finally find to end this chapter of my life."" Roenick compiled a total of 513 goals with 703 assists with the Chicago Blackhawks (1988-89 to 1995-96), the Phoenix Coyotes (1996-97 to 2000-01 and 2006-07), the Philadelphia Flyers (2001-02 to 2003-04), the Los Angeles Kings (2005-06) and the San Jose Sharks (2007-08 and 2008-09). Only Brett Hull, Mike Modano and Keith Tkachuk scored more goals in the NHL than Roenick among U.S.-born players. Datsyuk, a 46-year-old Russian, spent all 14 seasons of his NHL seasons with the Detroit Red Wings. He logged 918 points (314 goals, 604 assists) and was part of Stanley Cup-winning sides in 2002 and 2008. Datsyuk also captured an Olympic gold medal in 2018 and was a four-time recipient of the Lady Byng Trophy, given for gentlemanly conduct. ""As I stand here today, I realize that being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame is tremendous honor, the honor I couldn't even dream of, but this moment is not mine alone. It is shared with all of you,"" Datsyuk said Monday. Weber, a 39-year-old British Columbia native, played with the Nashville Predators from 2005-06 to 2015-16 and then with the Montreal Canadiens from 2016-17 to 2020-21. The defenseman posted 589 points (224 goals, 365 assists) in the NHL and won gold with Canada in 2010 and 2014. ""I want to thank all those players who demonstrated the importance of hard work and dedication,"" Weber said Monday. ""By passing on your knowledge to the next generation, you're ensuring that the spirit of this game continues to thrive. ""It's also when the coaches and staff teach you the nuances of the game. They challenge you to get better every day."" Darwitz notched the winning goal for Minnesota in the 2005 NCAA championship game against Harvard. She played for the United States at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 Olympics. ""I wasn't your everyday little girl, and somehow my mom was on to me,"" Darwitz said Monday. ""Despite some obvious distraction techniques on her part, in the name of tap dancing classes and shopping trips, she knew where my heart was, and on my fifth birthday, my blonde French braid strolled into the hockey rink."" Wendell-Pohl, another Golden Gophers great, captured the Patty Kazmaier Award for the top female college hockey player in 2005. She was selected the MVP of the 2005 IIHF World Championships, when the U.S. team won its first gold medal, and she was the captain of the 2006 Olympic team. ""I feel so fortunate that hockey has allowed me to represent not only my hometown, my state but my country,"" Wendell-Pohl said. ""Playing in the Olympics was never why I started playing hockey but I am beyond grateful to have been blessed and had the opportunity to wear the red, white and blue."" Campbell has been a player, coach and executive across a 52-year hockey career, and he has been the senior executive vice president for the NHL's hockey operations, officiating and central scouting departments for 25 years. Campbell won a Stanley Cup as associate coach of the New York Rangers in 1994. Poile retired as general manager of the Nashville Predators in 2023 after becoming the winningest and longest-tenured general manager in league history.

That's what Seattle Kraken coach Dan Bylsma did with forwards Oliver Bjorkstrand and Tye Kartye on Nov. 5 at Colorado. The move seems to have paid off, as Bjorkstrand scored a goal and Kartye assisted on another as the Kraken snapped a four-game skid with a 4-3 overtime victory against the visiting Vegas Golden Knights on Friday. After a weekend off, the Kraken will host the struggling Columbus Blue Jackets on Tuesday. Bjorkstrand's gritty goal early in the third period -- Golden Knights goalie Adin Hill lunged to make a pokecheck, only for the puck to careen off Bjorkstrand as he charged to the top of the crease and deflect into the net -- put the Kraken ahead 3-2 after they had fallen behind 2-0. ""I thought his game, in particular, was a great bounce-back game for him,"" Bylsma said. ""He's a talented, skilled player with a great shot and scores a lot of goals. His competition was at a great level for him to have success in the game. And it's not just the evidence of going to the net and scoring a dirty goal, but on the wall in the first period, at the faceoff (circle), also in the first period, the battle on the wall in the second period in front of our bench. It was great."" Bjorkstrand, who told reporters he needed to be better when asked about being a healthy scratch, was pleased to impact the game. ""Yeah, it was good,"" he said. ""I would have been ready in Colorado, but I was ready (Friday), kept it simple. I feel like I played well with the puck and was able to create some chances."" After a promising start to the season, the Blue Jackets are winless in their past five games (0-4-1). They fell 4-2 on Sunday at Anaheim as Ducks goaltender John Gibson, making his season debut after undergoing an emergency appendectomy on Sept. 25, stopped 38 shots. Kirill Marchenko had a goal and an assist for Columbus. Yegor Chinakhov also scored, and Daniil Tarasov made 26 saves. ""It's unacceptable,"" said Columbus defenseman Zach Werenski, who was playing in his 500th NHL game. ""Enough with the moral victories. We've played well enough in a lot of games this year to win and we end up losing them, and that's on us. ""We have to look ourselves in the mirror and find a way to win hockey games. I don't care if we outshoot them 50-20 or we get outshot 50-20. At the end of the day, we have to find a way to get points in this league and win hockey games, and we haven't done it."" The Blue Jackets have scored just nine goals during their losing streak. ""Goal-scoring is funny. It goes in streaks,"" Columbus coach Dean Evason said. ""A few weeks back, we couldn't miss and the pucks were finding their way in and we were getting some bounces and good stuff. And now it's gone the other way a little bit, but there's nothing we can do about it now except move forward and keep doing those things to get those opportunities."" Both teams could have lineup reinforcements Tuesday. The Kraken reacquired forward Daniel Sprong, who scored 21 goals for them in 2022-23, in a trade with the Vancouver Canucks. The Blue Jackets claimed defenseman Dante Fabbro, a former first-round pick, off waivers from the Nashville Predators. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Minnesota fell 95-94 to Miami on Sunday after Mike Conley missed a 3-pointer in the last two seconds. The Wolves committed 20 turnovers in the loss. After the game, Minnesota coach Chris Finch took the blame for some confusion during the game's final two possessions. Center Rudy Gobert appreciated Finch's apology but said it was a team loss. ""We were in a position to win, and we weren't able to close it out,"" Gobert said.

Minnesota has won its last five meetings against Portland, which turned in a dismal performance against a depleted Memphis squad. The Grizzlies played without injured guards Ja Morant (hip) and Desmond Bane (oblique) and still led by as many as 25 points in the second quarter. ""It was just (expletive) embarrassing,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said. ""We were soft as hell the whole game. Nobody really fought. It was just embarrassing for everybody. That's just not who we are. It really isn't. No excuse for that."" Jerami Grant led the Blazers with 20 points, while Dalano Banton and Donovan Clingan had 13 points apiece off the bench. Portland opened a four-game homestand by shooting 4-of-42 (9.5 percent) from 3-point range and committing 23 turnovers. ""It was like our guys just showed up because they had to be here and didn't want to play,"" Billups said. ""Didn't want to actually work. And that's embarrassing. It's unfortunate that we had to go out there in front of our fans who paid their hard-earned money to come and see their favorite team play, and we show up and do that."" Blazers guard Shaedon Sharpe, coming back from a shoulder injury, played in his third game and made his first start of the season on Sunday and had seven points on 3-of-10 shooting. Sharpe started in place of forward Deni Avdija, who is averaging 9.0 points and 5.6 rebounds. In 13 minutes off the bench, Avdija missed all five of his field-goal attempts.

Matthew Stafford was 32-of-46 passing for 293 yards, but did not throw for a touchdown with one interception, the sixth consecutive game he threw a pick.

Rookie Joshua Karty made five field goals for Los Angeles, including a career best from 55 yards. After Karty missed a 57-yard field-goal attempt on the opening drive of the second half, the Dolphins responded with a six-play, 53-yard drive that ended with Hill's 1-yard TD reception from Tagovailoa for a 17-6 lead. The Rams had 133 yards of offense in the fourth quarter but were only able to come away with three Karty field goals. Sanders made a 37-yard field goal with 9:07 remaining before his boot from 50 yards gave Miami a 23-12 lead with less than three minutes on the clock. The Dolphins took the opening drive of the game 70 yards in five plays with Malik Washington scoring on a 19-yard end around for a 7-0 lead. A defensive tussle immediately ensued.

The 34-year-old Thompson, a first-round pick by the Warriors in 2011, elected to leave Golden State in a sign-and-trade over the summer, ending a 13-year run that included two missed seasons because of Achilles and knee injuries. The four-time champion and five-time All-Star is averaging 13.8 points in his first 10 games for the Mavericks after averaging 17.9 points for the Warriors last season. Thompson departed Golden State ranked second to Stephen Curry on the franchise all-time list for career 3-pointers (2,481), while also sitting fourth in games (793), sixth in points (15,531) and ninth in steals (676). The homecoming comes as part of the second edition of the NBA Cup, an in-season tournament that was drawn with the Mavericks and Warriors in the same five-team pool with the Memphis Grizzlies, New Orleans Pelicans and Denver Nuggets. Thompson attempted to downplay his return by citing excitement for the NBA Cup, in which he and the Warriors went 2-2 last season. ""It'll be good to see people you grinded with,"" he said over the weekend. ""But to me, it's just another regular-season game in November. Obviously, there are bigger implications with the NBA Cup, so what's on my mind is to win that because I haven't been a part of it yet. I know it's young, but it'd be fun to play for that title."" Thompson's departure from the Warriors came as part of a six-team trade in which the Warriors acquired, among others, Buddy Hield from the Philadelphia 76ers. Hield has more than made up for the loss of Thompson, ranking among the NBA leaders in 3-pointers (40) and 3-point field goal percentage (48.8). Thompson has made 29 treys at a 35.4 percent clip for the Mavericks. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said there are no hard feelings about Thompson leaving. ""Sometimes a fresh start can be healthy,"" he said. ""Everybody's life and career arc is different. I think Klay made the right decision going to Dallas. Just seeing him the last couple of years, I think he needed a fresh start."" The Warriors plan to greet Thompson with a ""Salute Captain Klay"" interactive experience that will include a pregame video tribute. The Warriors have announced that his No. 31 will be retired when his playing days are over. Curry applauds the idea of celebrating his ""Splash Brother"" sooner rather than later. ""We have a game to play, so the focus has to be there,"" he said. ""But he deserves the celebration and the welcome he's going to get. It's a chance to reflect on all the memories we created together."" Coming off a 4-1 trip that included wins over the Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder, the Warriors take an 8-2 record into a four-day sequence in which they also will host Memphis in an NBA Cup game on Friday. With Kyrie Irving scoring 43 points, the Mavericks opened a three-game trip with a 122-120 loss at Denver on Sunday. Luka Doncic had 24 points, nine rebounds and nine assists. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Dustin Wolf, who came within a whisker of his first career shutout, made 29 saves. He also collected his first NHL point with an assist. Kevin Rooney also scored and Backlund finished with two points. Trevor Moore scored with 2:31 left in regulation for the Kings, while goaltender Darcy Kuemper stopped 25 shots. Despite outshooting and collecting more chances the visitors from the drop of the puck -- the Kings needed more than 11 minutes to register their first shot on goal -- the Flames failed to score for nearly 30 minutes to open the game. Backlund opened the scoring at 10:42 of the second period after gaining the puck in the slot off a turnover and whipping a top-corner shot for his fourth goal of the season. Huberdeau doubled the lead right shortly after the ensuing puck drop. Andrei Kuzmenko sprung Huberdeau on a partial breakaway, and, while holding off a check, Huberdeau slipped a low shot into the cage for his sixth goal of the campaign. Wolf got his assist on that goal. Moore finally solved Wolf with late in the third, converting a golden chance that needed video review to prove crossed the line for his third goal of the season. Rooney iced the game with an empty-net goal, his first tally of the season, with 20 seconds on the clock. Wolf showed he was on his game early when he denied Kevin Fiala on a first-period breakaway. He stared down Anze Kopitar moments after his team staked the 2-0 lead, and kept the door shut early in the third period when Adrian Kempe was sprung on a golden opportunity. Earlier in the day, the Flames announced forward Anthony Mantha would miss the remainder of the season due to knee surgery. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Zverev, the event's second seed, and Rublev, the eighth seed, began round-robin play in the John Newcombe Group. In the other match on Monday, also in the Newcombe Group, sixth-seeded Casper Ruud of Norway upset third-seeded Carlos Alcaraz of Spain 6-1, 7-5. The eight players in the season-ending tournament are split into two groups for the initial phase. The top two players from each group will advance to the semifinals. Zverev, 27, captured the year-ending event in 2018 and 2021. He enjoyed a strong 2024 season, reaching three Grand Slam semifinals for the first time in his career. He lost to Alcaraz in the French Open final and advanced to the semifinals of the Australian Open. On Monday, Zverev finished with a 9-3 edge in aces and a 22-10 advantage in winners. He never faced a break point and won on all seven of his net approaches. ""I thought it was a very solid match from my end,"" Zverev said. ""Against anyone here, you have to play your best to have a chance, you have to be solid (and) mentally strong. I feel like I did that today, I felt like I used my chances quite well and I'm obviously happy with this win."" He isn't bothered by not being favorite this season and this week. ""I think the attention went to Carlos and Jannik (Sinner) all year long,"" Zverev said. ""They deserve it, they won two Grand Slams each. ""It's normal in sports, at some point everybody retires, new players come along. We have a great group of guys leading with Jannik and Carlos. I think they had a better year, even though I'm No. 2 in the world. The benchmark is those two guys."" Alcaraz stumbled against Ruud, particularly at the key moments. Ruud saved five of the six break points on his serve while taking advantage of all four of his break opportunities. ""It's only one match, but it's definitely one of the best wins of the season for me,"" Ruud said. ""In terms of who I'm playing, his level, his ranking and all this stuff. I feel very happy, of course. I think we will see Carlos play better tennis than he did today, but I took care of my chances."" The Ilie Nastase Group continues play Tuesday, with top-seeded Jannik Sinner of Italy opposing fifth-seeded Taylor Fritz of the United States while fourth-seeded Daniil Medvedev of Russia opposes seventh-seeded Alex de Minaur of Australia.

""He's close,"" Collins said of the player's status. Northwestern (1-1) was without Barnhizer for its first two games, including Saturday night's 71-66 road loss to Dayton. The Wildcats led by as many as 13 in the first half before the Flyers came back, outscoring Northwestern 47-34 in the second half. Junior Nick Martinelli recorded career highs with 32 points and 14 boards. He made 12 of 16 field-goal attempts, including all three from beyond the arc. Martinelli was selected the Big Ten Player of the Week on Monday after becoming the first player in the conference since at least 1996-97 to post 25-plus points and 10-plus rebounds in the first two games of a season. Barnhizer is out with a lower-body injury but took part in warm-ups ahead of the Flyers game. Barnhizer averaged 14.6 points and 7.5 rebounds last season. Northwestern is attempting to win its fourth straight game against UIC. Collins is 3-0 against the Flames, each win by double digits. The teams last met in December 2022, with the Wildcats pulling away 92-54. The Wildcats lead the series 6-4. Freshman guard Angelo Ciaravino is slowly getting used to playing at the collegiate level through two games. Even in a losing effort, Ciaravino said it is a building block for future success. ""It's very surreal stepping out there and seeing all those people, but at the end of the day, it's us vs. them, and it's about focusing on what's on the court and drowning everything else out,"" said Ciaravino, who scored 12 points in 21 minutes against Dayton. The Flames (2-0) have rolled through their nonconference schedule thus far. In their victories against St. Francis (Ill.) and Yale, they scored 91 points in each game, with five scorers reaching double figures against the Bulldogs on Friday night. Tyem Freeman led the way in the 91-79 home victory with 19 points off the bench, while Jordan Mason added 16 in a reserve role. Sasa Ciani posted a double-double with 13 points and 11 rebounds, Jayon Jackson scored 13 and Ahmad Henderson II contributed 11 points and a game-high seven assists. UIC's last win against a power-conference opponent came at Northwestern's expense, 50-44 in 2012. The game against the Flames is the first of four home games at Welsh-Ryan Arena before the Wildcats travel to Tempe, Ariz., to take on Butler in the Arizona Tip-off on Thanksgiving Day. The Flames host Saint Mary's (Minn.) on Saturday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Oklahoma City is 3-0 this season on the second night of a back-to-back. The loss snapped a four-game winning streak by the Clippers. The Clippers cut what was a 20-point deficit to three with just more than two minutes remaining before Gilgeous-Alexander answered with a step-back 3-pointer. Ivica Zubac's three-point play with 42 seconds left cut the deficit to 130-128 before Gilgeous-Alexander hit a pair of free throws and Luguentz Dort had a steal leading to a Jalen Williams dunk in the closing seconds to put the game away. Playing a day after Chet Holmgren suffered a pelvic fracture in a loss to Golden State, the Thunder leaned heavily on Gilgeous-Alexander and Williams. Gilgeous-Alexander was 13 of 21 from the field and hit a season-high four 3-pointers while Williams added 28 points on 11-of-16 shooting. The Thunder shot 51.6 percent from the floor and were 22 of 23 from the free-throw line. Holmgren will be evaluated in eight to 10 weeks, the Thunder announced before the game. Playing without Holmgren, and with several other frontcourt players injured as well, the Thunder went with a smaller lineup. Oklahoma City thrived for much of the game after starting Williams with Aaron Wiggins and Dort in the frontcourt. The Thunder led for much of the game, building their lead to 20 by midway through the third. But the Clippers finally had success on the interior over the last half of the quarter, reeling off a 25-10 run to cut the deficit to five heading into the fourth. Zubac had six points and a block during the run, while Norman Powell had 12 points. Powell had a pair of steals in the final two minutes of the quarter that led to points on the other end.

Sengun paired 27 points with 17 rebounds to pace the Rockets, who overcame the absence of point guard Fred VanVleet (hamstring). Houston recorded only 13 assists, relying on transition opportunities and a dominant performance from Sengun in the paint to survive. Kyle Kuzma scored eight points during an 11-4 Wizards run that opened the fourth and cut the deficit to 86-80.

UNC Greensboro responded, cutting the deficit to 19-15 on Donovan Atwell's reverse layup, and on the ensuing possession, Giles' driving layup put the Spartans within two. Polite's fastbreak layup tied the score, and UNC Greensboro soon claimed a 21-19 lead when Jalen Breath scored in the paint off a well-placed pass from Miles Jones on the right wing.

Erik Johnson also scored for Philadelphia, while Samuel Ersson made 28 saves. Michkov, who was a healthy scratch in each of the Flyers' previous two games, finished with a goal and an assist before his key tally in the shootout. Jack Thompson, Mikael Granlund and Barclay Goodrow scored for the Sharks, who had won five of their previous seven games. Vitek Vanecek made 40 saves for the visitors. After both teams failed on their first shootout attempt, Michkov deposited an impressive backhand-to-forehand move. Following a save by Ersson, Konecny netted the decisive goal, dragging the puck on his forehand before flipping it under the crossbar. The Flyers scored twice in the first period, beginning with Johnson's first goal of the season at 1:40. With just over four minutes left in the period, Konecny made it 2-0 on a tic-tac-toe setup, as Emil Andrae found Michkov, who one-timed a feed to Konecny, whose blast from the right circle beat Vanecek for a power-play goal. At 5:09 of the second period, Michkov got behind the defense and beat Vanecek 5-hole to make it 3-0. However, San Jose began to chip away later in the period. With about 4 1/2 minutes left in the stanza, William Eklund's centering pass caromed off Thompson's skate and past Ersson to get the Sharks on the board. About three minutes later, Eklund set up Granlund at the right faceoff dot for a spicy wrister that got under the crossbar. The score remained 3-2 until Goodrow netted the equalizer with 2:24 left in regulation. Henry Thrun's shot from the left point ricocheted to the right of the net where Goodrow slammed it past Ersson. San Jose began overtime with two minutes of a 4-on-3 advantage after Michkov took a roughing penalty at the end of regulation. Ersson made several key saves during the ensuing penalty kill. Vanecek made some key stops on the other end late in overtime, including denials of Andrae and Michkov to send the game to a shootout. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Dallas, which entered Monday with just 39 goals in 13 games, feasted on the league's third-worst scoring defense. In winning for the second time in three games, the Stars did nearly all of their damage in the opening period and cruised from there. The first-period six-pack tied the then-Minnesota North Stars, who also scored six in the first 20 minutes in a 7-2 win over the Los Angeles Kings on March 16, 1971. The franchise record for goals in any period is eight, set by Minnesota in the second period of a 15-2 home win against Winnipeg on Nov. 11, 1981. The half-dozen goals that got past Joel Blomqvist and Alex Nedeljkovic on just 12 shots were also the most Pittsburgh ever allowed in the first period at home. Five Stars players recorded two or more points in the barrage, with Marchment (one goal, three assists) tying a team record with four points in one period. That occurred 10 times previously, with Tyler Seguin and Valeri Nichushkin both accomplishing the feat most recently against Philadelphia on Dec. 7, 2013. Marchment's goal came when Brendan Smith cleared the puck from the Stars' end as both teams changed lines. The puck bounced off the board behind the Penguins' net and toward the slot, where Marchment got ahead of Matt Grzelcyk and Kris Letang to beat Blomqvist, make it 3-0 and end the starting netminder's night with 9:44 remaining in the period. Marchment, who entered Monday with two goals and six assists in 12 games, helped on goals from Matt Duchene, Miro Heiskanen and Seguin. He added a fifth point, one off his career high, when he and Duchene assisted on Wyatt Johnston's third-period goal. Heiskanen added an unassisted goal as he tallied his first two of the season, and the fifth two-goal game in the defenseman's career. Logan Stankoven also scored. After allowing three goals on four shots in relief of Blomqvist, Nedeljkovic settled down to make 28 saves for the Penguins, who lost for the third time in four games. Tristan Jarry, recalled from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton on Saturday, was a healthy scratch. Dallas goalie Jake Oettinger rebounded from being pulled after giving up four goals in less than 30 minutes in a loss at Winnipeg on Saturday. He made 20 saves on Monday, only allowing a second-period goal by Anthony Beauvillier. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

After a disappointing loss to Austin Peay their last time out, Bulldogs coach Thad Matta inserted Augusto Cassia into the starting line-up looking for a quick start, and he responded with a career high 16. Butler was also looking to cut down on turnovers after committing 35 in their first two games. Butler only committed 11 on the night. Donovan Williams led Western Michigan with 17 points and nine rebounds, while teammate JaVaughn Hannah chipped in 15. The Broncos were 4-of-22 from 3-point range. Western Michigan opened with five straight points to start the contest with Hannah hitting a fall-away jumper and a 3-pointer from the wing. That would be the Broncos biggest lead of the night. Still, the first half saw the teams trading baskets. The game was tied 11 times in the first half and saw seven lead changes. Butler led 39-37 at halftime. The Bulldogs opened the second half hot. Cassia started things with a dunk on an alley-oop. Finley Bizjack added a driving basket and the Bulldogs went on a 16-2 run over a four-minute span to make it 55-39. Western Michigan responded with a 15-2 burst capped by a jumper from the elbow by Strickland with 11:11 to pull to 57-54, but Butler dominated the final minutes. Western Michigan scored only four points in the final 7:02 as the Bulldogs closed out with the game's final ten points. Butler went 10-21 from 3-point range and had 21 assists to the Broncos' seven. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Virginia Tech won the rebounding battle 43-32 and had seven more second-chance points. Schutt hit two 3-pointers early in the second half to give the Hokies a 29-27 lead. He added another trey with 16:38 left, and the lead was 32-28. Both teams went long stretches without a basket, but Doucet's driving layup pulled the Eagles within 35-34 with 11:46 remaining. Lawal's layup and Ben Hammond's 3-pointer from the right wing gave the Hokies their largest lead to that point, 40-34. Winthrop stayed close and Harrison's layup pulled them within 40-39 with 8:51 to go. The Eagles tied it briefly before five quick Virginia Tech points made it 47-42 with 6:13 remaining. The first half featured seven lead changes. Harrison's jump shot gave Winthrop an early 11-7 edge before Virginia Tech's Tyler Johnson scored the final four points of a 6-0 run.

Lathan Sommerville scored 14 points off the bench with four rebounds and three blocks, while Jordan Derkack scored nine points and made key defensive stops in one-on-one coverage late to give the Scarlet Knights a 2-0 start to their season. Saint Peter's (0-3) were on a scoreless drought of about five minutes when Adetokunbo Bakare scored seven consecutive points for the Peacocks. After a layup and 3-point shot on consecutive fast breaks, the guard who didn't play a minute of the first half cut the visitor's deficit to four points, 57-53, after the Scarlet Knights had led by nine points with 11:04 remaining. Saint Peter's took the lead with 5:41 remaining after two shots from deep from Marcus Randolph and a go-ahead layup by Tyreck Morris. Then the two sides tied at 63 and traded baskets. After Morris' layup put the Peacocks ahead 65-64 with 4:07 remaining in regulation, the Scarlet Knights went on an 11-0 run to close out the game. Randolph led the scoring for Saint Peter's with 22 points. Mouhamed Sow added nine points with six rebounds. The difference for Rutgers was aggressive play by Saint Peter's, which committed 23 fouls against the Scarlet Knights. From those extra trips to the line, Rutgers added 12 points in the second half and went 18-for-25 from the line on the night. Rutgers was without top freshman prospect Ace Bailey, who hasn't played yet this season after sustaining an undisclosed injury in practice last week. Saint Peter's shooting gave the visitors an early advantage, going 16-for-30 from the field in the first half. However, Peacocks made only one of their first 10 shots from the floor to start the second half, with Rutgers outscoring them 18-6 in the first 10 minutes of the half.

Florida (3-0), which had only broken even in rebounding margin after two games, managed a 45-24 rebounding edge on Monday.  Sophomore center Rueben Chinyelu paced the Gators with a career-high 14 points on 7-for-8 shooting. Walter Clayton Jr. chipped in12 points, including 3-for-7 shooting from 3-point range. Will Richard also added 12 points and five rebounds, and Sam Alexis had 12 points and six rebounds. Alex Condon tallied 10 points, eight boards and two blocks. Florida shot 45.3 percent from the field and 30.4 percent (7 for 23) from long range. The Gators seemed unphased by the recent sexual misconduct allegations surrounding coach Todd Golden. Golden coached the game, as the matter is under investigation from the university. Grambling (1-2) came in off a two-point loss to Ole Miss but couldn't stay as close this time. Kintavious Dozier led the Tigers with 19 points and added five rebounds. Antwan Burnett added 15 points and five boards. Grambling pulled within 46-34 on a dunk by Ernest Ross with 17:24 to play, but Florida answered with a 9-0 run. The Tigers got no closer than 17 points thereafter. Grambling started the night's scoring on a layup by Dozier. Florida took the lead immediately on a 3-pointer from Clayton and never trailed again.  The Tigers pulled within 16-10 with 13:10 left in the first half on a bucket by James Flippin, who finished with 12 points.

Guillermo Diaz-Graham powered for 10 points and nine rebounds while Zack Austin provided 10 points and four blocks for Pitt, which took advantage of its superior size inside. Darryl Simmons II paced Gardner-Webb (1-2) with 12 points. Anthony Selden and Jamaine Mann added 10 points each for the Runnin' Bulldogs, while Isaiah Richards had six points and a game-high 14 rebounds. After Gardner-Webb made a program-record 70 percent of its field-goal attempts on Friday in a win over North Carolina Central, the Runnin' Bulldogs made just 39.7 percent of their shots from the floor on Monday. Before the game was five minutes old, Pitt opened a 14-2 lead, which Leggett started and finished with baskets in the paint. Diaz-Graham added a 3-pointer and Dunn followed with a three-point play to fuel the surge. Midway through the half, Pitt began a 13-0 spree that included 3-pointers by Austin and Leggett. When Leggett finished the run with a fastbreak layup, the Panthers were on top 34-13. Over the final 6:05 of the half, Pitt missed nine consecutive field-goal attempts against Gardner-Webb's active 2-3 zone. During the dry spell, the Runnin' Bulldogs got 3-pointers from Ademide Badmus and Selden to cut a 21-point deficit to 38-23 at the break. Gardner-Webb made some noise in the second half, slicing a 19-point gap to 11 as Brendan Mycalcio came off the bench and scored six quick points. The Runnin' Bulldogs made their run largely by hustling for offensive rebounds. A three-point play by Selden midway through the half made it 55-44, but Gardner-Webb got no closer the rest of the way.

Reese barely missed a double-double but led the Terrapins (3-0) to their third consecutive victory by 30 or more points to open the season. Reese was one of five Maryland players to score in double figures as the Terrapins led wire-to-wire and were able to play 14 players after taking a double-digit lead for good with 3:53 left in the first half. Tyler Shirley with 10 points was the lone double-figure scorer for the Rattlers (0-3), who continued to struggle early on against tough competition in coach Patrick Crarey II's first season. Shirley, however, fouled out with 9:36 left in the second half. Maryland scored the game's first 15 points in three minutes. The Terrapins took advantage of five turnovers during that span and that became a theme throughout the contest as they finished with 11 steals. Florida A&M ended up with 22 turnovers overall, which led to 31 Maryland points. Ja'Derryus Eatmon's layup with 16:41 left in the first half finally got the Rattlers on the scoreboard. It also sparked a 12-2 surge, which cut Maryland's early advantage to five. But the Terrapins continued to turn mistakes into fast-break points and broke the game open by halftime, leading 40-21.

Also scoring in double figures for Virginia (2-0) were Isaac McKneely with 14 points and Dai Dai Ames with 13. Coach Tony Bennett is retired, but the Cavaliers showed that they can still play strong defense under interim coach Ron Sanchez. Virginia had 11 blocks and seven steals and limited Coppin State to 28 percent shooting from the field, including a 21.1 percent mark (4 of 19) from 3-point distance. Derrius Ward scored 12 points and Jonathan Dunn had 11 to lead the Eagles (0-4), who have lost 17 consecutive games dating back to last season. The Cavaliers blew the game open midway through the second half. Cofie's 3-pointer with 9:09 remaining capped a 13-0 run and gave Virginia a 53-27 lead.

Ohio State was playing as a ranked team for the first time since landing in the top 25 the week of Jan. 2, 2023.  Cris Carroll had 10 points and Ty Harper and Gabe Dynes each scored nine points for the Penguins (1-1), who were 3-for-22 on 3-pointers (13.6 percent).  Bradshaw and Stewart had only two points apiece in a season-opening victory against then-No. 19 Texas last Monday, but they combined for 15 in the first half against the Penguins.  Mobley, who went 4-for-4 from beyond the arc vs. the Longhorns, knocked down his first three triples of the night against Youngstown State to run his streak of made treys to seven before recording his first miss from deep.  It was a wonder why the Penguins only trailed 37-22 at intermission after their epic cold spells. They took a 2-0 lead 16 seconds into the game but went the next 6:14 without scoring while the Buckeyes reeled off 12 straight points. The Ohio State lead reached 13 points, 27-14, before Youngstown State got as close as nine, but it then went the final 6:34 of the first half without a made field goal. However, the Penguins did sink five free throws during that stretch.  Ohio State opened the second half on an 8-2 run to build a 45-24 cushion, then led by at least 20 the rest of the way.  Because a power outage on the Youngstown State campus postponed the Penguins' season opener against Westminster last Monday, the team will begin the season with six straight games away from home for the first time in program history. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

In last season's inaugural edition of the NBA Cup, then called the NBA In-Season Tournament, Phoenix advanced from the five-team group at 3-1 to reach the knockout round. Utah finished third in the group at 2-2. Through the first few weeks of this regular season, the Jazz struggled to an 0-6 start -- the franchise's worst opening stretch since going 0-8 in 2013-14. Utah tips off the NBA Cup having won two of three games, however, coming off a 111-110 decision in San Antonio on Saturday. Collin Sexton's free throws with 3.2 seconds gave Utah a necessary buffer, as Devin Vassell hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Sexton finished with a team-high 23 points, as the Jazz improved to 2-1 this season when he notches 20-plus points. Sexton scored 24 in the 135-126 win at Chicago on Nov. 4. Lauri Markkanen scored 20 points in his second game back in the lineup after leaving the Oct. 29 loss to Sacramento with back spasms. Rookie forward Kyle Filipowski played a strong all-around game against the Spurs with eight points, six assists and five rebounds. ""He's very comfortable with the ball in his hands,"" Jazz coach Will Hardy said of Filipowski, per the Deseret News. ""It gives us a lot of (options) on offense, especially when he's out there with John (Collins) and Lauri."" Fellow Utah rookie guard Isaiah Collier, helping fill in with Keyonte George out with a foot injury, had seven points, six rebounds and four assists in his second NBA game. While Utah tips off the NBA Cup coming off of just its second win on the season, Phoenix begins group play coming off of only its second loss. The Suns lost to visiting Sacramento 127-118 in overtime, snapping their seven-game winning streak. Devin Booker scored 28 points, Bradley Beal added 23 and Tyus Jones recorded a season-high 22 to shoulder the bulk of the offensive load with Kevin Durant sidelined.   Durant sustained a left calf strain in Phoenix's 114-113 win over Dallas on Friday. The team announced the 11-time All-NBA forward will miss at least the next two weeks. Beal, who has been dealing with an elbow sprain, also collided with DeMar DeRozan on Sunday and underwent an X-ray on his left knee following the game. Results from the X-ray returned negative. Beal's incident came after Jusuf Nurkic exited the game with an ankle injury. ""Our depth definitely got tested with Nurk going out,"" Suns coach Mike Budenholzer said.  Veteran reserve Mason Plumlee, who Budenholzer said has been ""very good"" for Phoenix this season, came on to provide six points, 11 rebounds and six assists. Fellow reserve Josh Okogie added nine points and five rebounds. Regardless of the status of Beal or Nurkic for Tuesday, Budenholzer is still looking for continued contributions from the bench. ""We've been talking about how positive we are on Oso (Ighodaro),"" Budenholzer said. ""Josh has done it now for two games in a row. ...

Conversely, the Edmonton Oilers' third-period outburst on Saturday provided a hint they might finally be ready to return to form. The former tries to bounce back and the latter aims to build momentum Tuesday night when New York visits Edmonton in the first clash of the season between the teams. Neither team has played since Saturday. The host Islanders squandered a two-goal lead in the third period and fell to the New Jersey Devils 4-3 in overtime. The visiting Oilers ended a two-game losing streak by scoring four goals in fewer than five minutes in the third period of a 7-3 win over the Vancouver Canucks. The loss snapped a season-high two-game winning streak for the Islanders, who appeared headed for victory when Dennis Cholowski and Brock Nelson scored within a stretch of 1:56 shortly beyond the midway point of the third period. But Dawson Mercer scored with 4:27 left for the Devils, who pulled goalie Jacob Markstrom with about 1:18 remaining and tied the score when Stefan Noesen's pass into the crease glanced off the stick and skate of Islanders defenseman Grant Hutton and trickled past Ilya Sorokin, who finished with 29 saves. Jack Hughes scored on a breakaway 2:35 into overtime to hand the Islanders their 14th loss -- counting the playoffs -- in games in which they led in the third period over the last two seasons. New York, which frittered away several one-goal leads in a 5-4 overtime loss to the Utah Hockey Club on Oct. 10, also gave up third-period advantages in a shootout win over the Montreal Canadiens on Oct. 19 and in an overtime victory over the Devils on Oct. 25. ""We managed to take a 3-1 lead. Unfortunately, we couldn't close,"" Islanders coach Patrick Roy said. ""Need to find a way to close those games."" Closing wasn't a problem Saturday for the Oilers, who led 3-0 fewer than five minutes into the second before the Canucks' Elias Pettersson and Filip Hronek scored twice in a span of 1:59. Connor Brown opened and closed the third-period flurry for the Oilers, who received goals in between from Connor McDavid and Brett Kulak. The four-goal third was the most prolific period of the season for Edmonton, which scored fewer than four goals in nine of its first 14 games. The win was the fifth in the last eight games for the defending Western Conference champion Oilers, who were a popular preseason pick to win the Stanley Cup but opened with five losses in their first seven games (2-4-1). ""It was a solid effort by our group, but the main thing is that third period, the way we showed composure and poise in the third and made plays with the lead and piled on,"" Brown said. ""I think there's a lot of momentum to be built off that game, especially that third period."" The Oilers will visit the Islanders on March 14 to conclude the two-game season series. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

After a dip to 8-4 in 1977, Robinson put together a two-year run of 23-1-1 in 1978-79, winning two more Rose Bowls and a national championship as designated by the coaches' poll in 1978. He coached another three seasons during that first tenure, producing such noted NFL stars as Marcus Allen, Ricky Bell, Charles White, Clay Matthews and Joey Browner. Allen and White both won the Heisman Trophy while playing for Robinson. In 1983, Robinson was handed the reins to the Los Angeles Rams and twice advanced to the NFC Championship Game in his tenure there (1983-1991), going 75-68. The Trojans re-hired Robinson for the 1993 season. While his second stint at USC did not produce the same highs, he did earn three more bowl wins over five seasons, including wins in the Cotton Bowl and Rose Bowl. His head coaching career wrapped in Las Vegas with UNLV, where he went 28-42 over six years. He also became a consultant with LSU and was present for the Tigers' national title in 2019. Overall, Robinson finished with an 8-1 record in bowl games over 18 seasons as a head coach. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Now the Nittany Lions try to go 3-for-3 -- not just in the win column but in reaching triple figures -- on Tuesday night when they host St. Francis in University Park, Pa. The key for Penn State has been its ability to score off turnovers. It has swiped the ball 28 times, leading to a 53-15 advantage in points off turnovers. The Nittany Lions also boast a 48-16 advantage in fast-break points. ""This is who we are and this is how we have to go about doing it,"" said second-year Penn State coach Mike Rhoades. ""The kids are confident in doing it. When you go out there, let your hair down and good things will happen."" Northern Illinois transfer Yanic Konan Niederhauser led five players in double figures during Friday night's 103-54 rout of UMBC, scoring 18 points and grabbing nine rebounds. The Nittany Lions sank 55.2 percent of their field-goal attempts, including 10 of 23 3-pointers, and collected 21 assists. Niederhauser and Zach Hicks are each averaging 17 ppg, with D'Marco Dunn supplying 14 ppg off the bench. Meanwhile, St. Francis enters with a 1-2 mark after rallying from an 11-point halftime deficit Sunday for a 65-64 win at Campbell. Valentino Pinedo capped the comeback by hitting a foul shot with two seconds left for the last of his career-high 15 points. ""It was great to win a game early in the season where we didn't fill up the stat sheet,"" Red Flash coach Rob Krimmel said. ""We played with more purpose and togetherness in the second half. We executed the game plan much better on both ends."" Ace Talbert leads the team in scoring at 11.7 ppg through three games, while Bobby Rosenberger is chipping in 10 ppg. Penn State has won the last six meetings in the series, including an 83-53 victory last season at home. St. Francis' last win in the series came in 1978. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Each league's trio of finalists were revealed on Monday night. Skenes, the star Pittsburgh Pirates right-handed pitcher, is up against Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Jackson Chourio and San Diego Padres outfielder Jackson Merrill. Skenes is the leading candidate in the National League after claiming the award from multiple publications since the end of his first season.  The No. 1 pick in the 2023 MLB Draft, Skenes was promoted from the minors to the Pirates' rotation on May 11. He led baseball in ERA from that point forward and became the fifth rookie pitcher to start the All-Star Game.  Skenes, 22, was 11-3 with a 1.96 ERA, 170 strikeouts and 0.95 WHIP in 2024. Merrill had 162 hits in 156 games, batting .292 with 61 extra-base hits (24 home runs, 31 doubles, six triples) and 90 RBIs. Chourio, in his first year in the big leagues for Milwaukee, batted .275 with 21 homers, 79 RBIs and 22 stolen bases in 148 games, splitting his time between left and right field. A starting pitcher is also favored on the AL side. Yankees right-hander Luis Gil, who had seven career appearances before 2024, quickly earned a spot in the team's starting rotation and finished the year with a 15-7 record, a 3.50 ERA, 171 strikeouts and a league-high 77 walks in 151 2/3 innings. He had 17 starts with one run or zero runs allowed. His New York batterymate Austin Wells appeared in 115 games and hit .229 with 13 homers and 55 RBIs. The third AL finalist is Baltimore Orioles outfielder Colton Cowser, who became an everyday player for the O's and batted .242 with 24 homers and 69 RBIs in 153 games. MLB will announce the winners in both leagues on Nov. 18.  Gil and Skenes were named rookies of the year in their respective leagues by Baseball Digest earlier this month.

Quatraro, 50, oversaw a stunning turnaround for the Royals, who were coming off a lifeless 56-106 last-place finish in 2023. A similar roster in 2024 became a winning squad under Quatraro's direction, going 86-76 with a second-place finish in the American League Central. This year's Royals earned a 2-0 sweep of the Baltimore Orioles in the AL wild-card series before dropping an AL Division Series to the New York Yankees three games to one. Quatraro will have stiff competition in the AL from two divisional rivals, A.J. Hinch of the Detroit Tigers and Stephen Vogt of the Cleveland Guardians. Hinch matched Quatraro by directing an 86-76 club that found postseason success. Hinch's Tigers swept the Houston Astros 2-0 in the other AL wild-card series and pushed the Guardians to five games in the ALDS before losing 3-2. Meanwhile, the first-place Guardians and Vogt had the most successful season of the bunch, winning 92 games and taking that postseason series with Detroit to make their first AL Championship Series since 2016. They lost in five games (4-1) to the Yankees. The nominees for the award in the National League were Pat Murphy of the Milwaukee Brewers, Mike Shildt of the San Diego Padres and Carlos Mendoza of the New York Mets. Murphy and Shildt each helmed 93-69 squads that made the postseason. While Murphy saw his season come to an end at the hands of Mendoza's 89-73 Mets, Shildt piloted the Padres to a 2-0 wild-card series win over the Atlanta Braves. Mendoza's squad went on to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies 3-1 in an NL Division Series to make the NL Championship Series, their first since 2015. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

South Carolina fell to North Florida in its opener before bouncing back with an 86-64 rout of South Carolina State on Friday. Jacobi Wright scored a career-best 20 points and Collin Murray-Boyles had 19 points and a career-high 16 rebounds. Murray-Boyles leads the Gamecocks in scoring (17 points per game) and rebounding (11.5). Wright is averaging 16 points on 72.2 percent shooting (13-of-18) and a team-best 4.5 assists. Wright also knocked down four 3-pointers against South Carolina State. ""Jacobi Wright, just in his DNA as a basketball player, is the kind of guy who's going to do those things more often,"" South Carolina coach Lamont Paris said of Wright. The Gamecocks never trailed, boasted a 51-36 rebounding edge and held South Carolina State to 3-of-16 shooting from 3-point range. But Paris wasn't pleased with his own team's long-range shooting. South Carolina was 8-of-27 -- Wright was 4-of-7 and the rest of the team was 4-of-20. ""I can't make them make it,"" Paris said. ""All I can do is provide the environment that they feel comfortable taking those shots."" Towson (1-1) split its first two games, losing at Saint Mary's in its opener before shellacking USCAA member Penn State Wilkes-Barre 89-34 on Friday. Tomiwa Sulaiman made a career-high six points while scoring 20 points and Tyler Tejada added 15. The Tigers made 14 3-pointers, two shy of the school record. Tejada leads Towson with a 16.5 scoring average and Dylan Williamson is contributing 12.5 per game. The Tigers would certainly like to post an attention-grabbing victory after stringing together three straight seasons of 20 or more wins. Towson hasn't played in the NCAA Tournament since 1991 but this group has made it a goal to end the long drought. ""We're going to take it one day at a time, one game at a time,"" Tigers guard Nendah Tarke recently said. ""We know that that's our end goal. We're far from that now, but if we keep up with the right habits and doing the right things, everything should take care of itself."" This is the third meeting between the schools. South Carolina won both of the first two with the most recent matchup being a 65-55 victory on Dec. 30, 1997. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

Following the Utes' 22-21 home loss to rival BYU on Saturday night that dropped Utah to 4-5 and 1-5 in the conference, Harlan unloaded on the officiating and the conference itself. ""This game was absolutely stolen from us,"" Harlan said. ""We were excited about being in the Big 12, but tonight I am not. We won this game. Someone else stole it from us. Very disappointed."" Those comments led to a fairly swift reaction from the league, which reprimanded Harlan with the fine and a statement Sunday. ""Mark's comments irresponsibly challenged the professionalism of our officials and the integrity of the Big 12 Conference,"" Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark said. ""There is a right way and a wrong way to voice concerns. Unfortunately, Mark chose the wrong way. Accordingly, this violation warrants a public reprimand and financial penalty. The Big 12 Conference prioritizes professionalism, integrity, and fairness, and will continue to do so."" Down 21-19, a holding penalty called on Utah cornerback Zemaiah Vaughn on fourth down negated a sack and gave BYU the ball at its own 19 with about 90 seconds left. The Cougars then drove down the field for a game-winning 44-yard field goal. With the win, which came before the largest crowd (54,383) ever at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, No. 9 BYU moved to 9-0, 6-0 in the conference, to stay firmly in the mix for a College Football Playoff berth. ""I recognize that there are more appropriate times and avenues to express those concerns, and I accept the consequences of my decision,"" Harlan said in a statement. ""My comments came after having just left our team locker room where our student-athletes were hurting and upset. The University of Utah is proud to be a member of the Big 12 Conference and we look forward to working with our peers to continue to enhance the league."" The game was the first between the two as conference mates since 2010 when both teams left the Mountain West Conference. Utah joined the Big 12 along with three other Pac-12 teams this summer. BYU joined the conference in 2023. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",2024-11-12

As part of the series, the Nets will take on the alternate identity of “Les Nets” during their six Quebec-based games. The team’s temporary red-and-blue logo features two fleur-de-lis on a blue circle, a nod to the Quebec flag. A large red circle within the blue includes Montreal’s Mount Royal cross, stylized to represent a basketball while incorporating the city name. The incorporation of red isn’t because the Long Island Nets typically use red (I mean, of course, it is); it’s a tribute to Montreal’s McGill University, where James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, taught in the 1880s. “Montreal has a vibrant basketball legacy, and this partnership presents a unique opportunity to blend our culture with the Laval community,” said Morgan Taylor, Head of Business Operations for the Long Island Nets, in the press release. “We look forward to engaging with a new fanbase and creating memorable moments both on and off the court.” The arrangement brings up memories of the unique situation Minor League Baseball’s Buffalo Bisons found themselves in during the 2021 season. With their MLB affiliate from Toronto residing in their home stadium due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Bisons shifted their home games to Trenton, NJ. They played with a split identity, using their usual Bisons name and uniforms on the road but taking on that of the Trenton Thunder at home.

Senior leadership will lie to you and say that they do not know, but if you ask the DSA crew leads and specialists what they are experiencing in the field, they will tell you.

In April, the 53-year-old senator voted against the $95 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine and has urged the eastern European nation to negotiate an end to its war with Russia. Yes, it seems like Rubio has begun aligning himself with the Trump agenda when it comes to foreign conflicts, and he appears to be on the fast track to the Secretary of State position. The other reported pick is a bit more out of left field: South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as the Director of Homeland Security.  Noem would replace the utterly awful Alejandro Mayorkas in overseeing Customs and Border Patrol, FEMA, ICE, and the Secret Service. And if there is anyone who is going to run their department as a Trump loyalist who will fight for the President's agenda, you can expect Noem to do so. Other key positions reportedly filled by the President-elect include: Chief of Staff: Susie Wiles, Trump's 2024 campaign manager. National Security Adviser: Mike Waltz, 3-term Florida Congressman, National Guard veteran, and former Pentagon policy adviser. Border Czar: Tom Homan.  (Enough said.) United Nations Ambassador: Elise Stefanik, Congresswoman, New York. MAGA Republican. Third-ranking member of Congress after replacing Liz Cheney as House Republican Conference Chair. Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy: Stephen Miller. Yes, that Stephen Miller. The man behind Trump's immigration agenda since 2015. Environmental Protection Agency: Lee Zeldin, Congressman, New York.

A mix of insiders and outsiders, but, so far, there's no doubt that all of these folks are Trump picks and Trump loyalists, which appears to be his primary motivation for selecting his cabinet.

This pastor described the 5 stages of grief he went through after the election, from the despair of Kamala losing, to the shame of living in a country where a woman of color couldn't beat out ""racism and misogyny,"" to the rage at his neighbors, to stress-eating carbs, listening to Tom Petty, and posting angrily on social media. And then the fog of grief that has enveloped me, and the worry for my trans child and my gay sister, and all of you, and not knowing if I can minister to anyone today.

Don Bacon (R-Neb.) and David Valadao (R-Calif.), while defeating several vulnerable Democratic incumbents. State Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-Pa.) unseated Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.), while businessman Rob Bresnahan defeated Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.). With control of the White House, both chambers of Congress, and a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court (and potential chances to expand that number in the next 4 years), the MAGA platform has a very rare window of opportunity to enact its reforms.

Domski worked for Blue Cross Blue Shield in the state for 30 years, and was 100% remote during the pandemic (as well as 75% remote previously) while working as an IT specialist. Despite requesting a religious exemption for the Covid vax, Blue Cross refused, triggering a lawsuit from Domski, who claimed she was a victim of religious discrimination. Her attorney, Jon Marko, said this in a statement: Our forefathers fought and died for the freedom for each American to practice his or her own religion. Neither the government nor a corporation has a right to force an individual to choose between his or her career and conscience. Lisa refused to renounce her faith and beliefs and was wrongfully terminated from the only job she had ever known. The jury's verdict today tells BCBSM that religious discrimination has no place in America and affirms each person's right to religious freedom.  The jury awarded Domski $10 million in punitive damages, $1.7 million in lost wages, and $1 million in noneconomic damages. Meanwhile, Blue Cross is super sad that their corporate HR tyranny got slapped down: While Blue Cross respects the jury process and thanks the individual jurors for their service, we are disappointed in the verdict. Blue Cross is reviewing its legal options and will determine its path forward in the coming days.  Follow Ian on Substack or X (@ighaworth).

The veteran anchor says he feels ""liberated"" having a break from the media, telling CNN, ""This is the first time in 55 years I've been between jobs."" Not only is he leaving CNN, the fakest of the fake news, but he seems to be done with old media as a whole.

Starting this weekend, he will bring his Green Bay Packers loyalty and overall football insight to NFL Network’s NFL GameDay Morning. 
	The NFL revealed Weezy F Baby as their new weekly guest this past Monday (Nov. 11). He will join their already loaded cast which boasts Rich Eisen, Kurt Warner, Steve Mariucci, Ian Rapoport, Mike Garafolo, Tom Pelissero, and a slew of lauded reporters next Sunday (Nov. 17).  
	Wayne’s guest spot was first teased during halftime of the New York Giants’ and Carolina Panthers’ game on Sunday morning (Nov. 10), live from Munich, Germany. The “A Milli” rapper is no stranger to talking sports, as he recently was a recurring guest on FS1’s Undisputed starring Skip Bayless.

	








 Lil Wayne will appear on ""NFL GameDay Morning"" every Sunday as a regular guest for the rest of the season, starting November 17.pic.twitter.com/FCJPzGjHT0 
	Lil Wayne’s history of sports talk goes back even further than that. He used to contribute blog posts to ESPN The Magazine and joined Around The Horn as a guest in 2009. He even found creative ways to bring together football and music, like his 2011 track “Green & Yellow” which was an homage to the Green Bay Packers. In 2016, he created “No Mercy” which was Shannon Sharpe and Skip Bayless’ theme song on Undisputed.

He had expressed his desire to perform less than a year ago and admitted that it “broke him” to not be picked.  
	“That hurt. It hurt a lot,” he said in a video. “I blame myself for not being mentally prepared for a letdown. And for automatically mentally putting myself in that position like somebody told me that was my position. So I blame myself for that. But I thought that was nothing better than that spot and that stage and that platform in my city, so it hurt. It hurt a whole lot.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox",2024-11-12

Now, redemption cards for complete sets of 1986-87 Fleer basketball are part of the 'Finale' of Jersey Fusion's ode to the original landmark product.","November 11, 2024 By Rich Mueller  Late last spring, cards from 50 complete sets of 1986-87 Fleer basketball and another hoard of 125 Michael Jordan rookie cards and stickers were put into a new product from Sportscards.com’s Jersey Fusion Line. Described as a years in the making “passion project” for company founder Bobby Poll, the Beckett encapsulated cards include small swatches of game-used gear used by the player on the card. Thousands of one card boxes were sold but six months later, the company has added some fresh content to the remaining inventory, including three redemption cards for fully PSA graded complete sets of cards and stickers, each with a Jordan rookie graded NM/MT 8.   The 1986-87 Fleer Jersey Fusion “Finale Edition” boxes also include a fourth redemption for a complete Jersey Fusion set of the 132 cards and 11 stickers that included the memorabilia pieces embedded in the holder. That set was originally pieced together by a collector who took advantage of the company’s offer last spring to trade it in for a game-worn, autographed 1991-92 Jordan jersey.  Sportscards.com is now giving that set back to the collecting community through the sales of the Finale edition. The product contains cards and memorabilia for all 131 players that were featured on the landmark Fleer set, which was the first in five years to be sold via wax packs.    At least three of the five boxes in a display case have autographed cards. Full cases contain six display cartons with a total of around 20 autographs. Some of the autographed cards carry inscriptions.  One of the biggest hits in the product One of the top pulls was an autographed Jordan rookie that carries a 9 autograph grade from Beckett and a portion of an NBA ‘Logoman’ patch from one of Jordan’s 1987-88 home uniforms. Other chase cards carry pieces of basketballs used in the NBA Finals.   Autographs from about 100 of the players in the set are possible, including Jordan, Julius Erving, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Charles Barkley and the late Bill Walton. A checklist that’s been pulled includes autographs of Erving, Bird and Johnson.  The back of each card in the product has a QR code on the reverse side that bring the collector to the site to see the original game-used  memorabilia item from which it was taken. Memorabilia used in the Jersey Fusion product came from jerseys, warm-ups, trunks, shoes, basketballs and even surfaces of NBA courts. Boxes and cases of the most recent edition are available here.  The previously released version, which still offers randomly packed Jordan rookie cards and stickers are still selling on eBay here.

To Jarrett, Brady was a transcendent football player, but more importantly, a leader he hoped to emulate at his workplace.  “I’m still hurt by what happened at that event,” Jarrett told SC Daily. “I lost all my respect for Tom Brady.” What occurred at that event has been well documented. Brady was the keynote speaker for a business conference organized by EXMA Global, a marketing company specializing in leadership and development events.  As part of his appearance at the Watsco Center in Miami, Brady was contracted to sign about 100 items for patrons who paid $3,600 for a package deal that included Brady’s speech, a photo op and an autograph. The tickets also included a yacht tour of Downtown Miami and networking events at art galleries. Most of the attendees were there for business and networking opportunities and wouldn’t have requested Brady’s autograph on high value items.
 Before delivering a one-hour speech that the attendees praised, Brady was ushered into a room where the items collectors were hoping to have signed were located.  All were meticulously prepared for Brady by a local dealer named Salomon Lutwak. Instructions were placed by each item regarding where to sign with colored pens.    Lutwak, who lives in South Florida, wanted to get a Brady rookie card signed. He volunteered to prepare the items for the signing room because he was friends with many of the collectors in attendance.   When Brady entered the room, Lutwak was asked to leave by Brady’s handlers. When he returned, he couldn’t believe his eyes. Near the end of the speech, Lutwak approached Greg Nazareth, a friend of Jarrett’s, who was also at the conference.  “Bro, all the signatures look like s***,” Lutwak told Nazareth.  Lutwak recorded the room for 18 seconds, sending the clip to Nazareth, who then sent it to the other collectors. They were stunned.  One of the gems in Jarrett’s collection was a ticket from the 2000 NFL Draft, where Brady was famously picked 199th overall. It is one of a handful that are known to exist. From the moment he bought it, Jarrett knew it was the one item he wanted signed in person by Brady. He thought the signing session would be the time and place. He knew Brady’s signature wasn’t a work of art, but he expected it to be similar to others. As the event moved forward, Jarrett was unsure how his ticket had been signed. He didn’t see it in the short video circulating among the collectors. But he saw enough of the autographs on his friends’ items to get angry. He took the photo op to voice his displeasure directly with Brady.   “Tom, I saw the signatures, and it’s messed up what you did,” Jarrett recalls telling Brady. “It’s not right. I spent a lot of money on this.” He walked 30 feet off the stage, turned around, and found Brady staring at him.  “He looked at me like he was shocked I had said something,” Jarret said. “Or surprised that he impacted people with that autograph. I’m not really sure.
 “Brady just gave a great speech about effort and how when he started putting forward the effort in college, small gradual results started happening and that shaped him into giving 100% effort in everything he does. He just lied because he put 0% effort into his signing.”  Nazareth was next in line behind Jarrett, about nine feet away, when he saw Brady’s face. He brought the only known used Brady helmet in the hands of a collector to get signed – a Tampa Bay Buccaneers practice helmet. He considers himself lucky with the autograph he received.  “It wasn’t good,” said Nazareth of his autograph. “But it was better than some of the other crap I saw. Brady turned to [Brad] and gave him a look almost as if to apologize.” The events that unfolded in the room are still up for speculation, but what’s not up for debate is that Brady didn’t sign all the items with his customary autograph for some reason. Instead, some items were marked with a scribble that one would never have guessed came from the legendary quarterback. Brady is known to give a quick, shorthand autograph in large crowds, earning a moniker among collectors as Tornado Tom. However, in their opinion, most of the autographs were worse than those administered by Brady when in a rush.  Many of the items – rare collectibles and, in some instances, unique pieces – were no better off than if a child had taken a marker and scrawled across them.  It’s believed that Brady entered the room expecting to find items like copies of his book, “The TB12 Method,” and glossy photos to sign. Instead, he may have been taken aback to find rare one-of-a-kind items tracing the arc of his career and equipment he once wore on the field, like game-used Super Bowl balls, game-used cleats, the used practice helmet, and the NFL Draft ticket. Typically, Brady signs through Fanatics, with whom he has an exclusive autograph deal. Through Fanatics, Brady will sign items for $4,000. Game-used memorabilia carries a $10,000 fee. Many of the types of items he encountered that day would typically be channeled through Fanatics.  When Brady entered the signing room, he could have: Instead, Brady went with a fourth option, doling out an illegible scribble for many of the items that had been laid out for him. Brady did appear to sign some items in a condensed version that earned him the Tornado Tom nickname. But even those were few and mostly reserved for lower-end items like replica jerseys and pennants.  When Jarrett saw his autographed ticket, he was crushed. It looked a little better than the Super Bowl ticket Brady had signed for another collector, but not much. With his regular autograph, some items would have gone up in value by tens of thousands of dollars. “Tom is a smart guy, and he knows how much his signature adds to what items,” Jarrett said. “He doesn’t like people profiteering off him. If I was in his shoes, and there was all this collectible stuff, I’d be pissed too, but you don’t take it out on the fans. He could have not done it.” At the center of the dispute are the terms set by Brady’s representatives and EXMA Global Founder and CEO Fernando Anzures. Anzures admitted to not knowing much about the signing portion of the event. He sourced that responsibility to Fernando Regato, a sports collector based out of Mexico, who used the EXMA Conference as an opportunity to run his first-ever signing event.  It’s believed that Anzures sold the signing portion of the event to Regato and left it up to him to coordinate and iron out the details.  If the contract between EXMA Global and Brady included a clause about the type of items that could be signed, that wasn’t communicated to the collectors who attended.     Brady’s signing and photo op for the VIPs were a small portion of the EXMA Global Conference that ran through the weekend. However, to the collectors who bought the tickets for $3,600, the autograph opportunity was the primary draw. A handful of die-hard Brady collectors first learned about the signing on the Tom Brady Collectors Group on Facebook.  Derek Wagner, a high-end Brady collector for more than 20 years, was excited about flying to Miami to meet Brady and take a picture with him. He learned about signing on Facebook and became the liaison between himself and four other collectors, including Jarrett, Nazareth, and Regato.  “It was supposed to be one of the greatest times of my life,” Wagner told SC Daily. “How many people get to meet Tom Brady and get his autograph? He’s been my idol for 20-plus years.” The exact terms between Brady and EXMA are unknown, but it appears the seven-time Super Bowl champion wasn’t expecting to see a room with multiple high-value items.  “Regato was telling us any item would be signed,” Jarrett said. “We were wondering, ‘Is this for real?’ We asked a bunch of questions.” “I knew Brady is signed exclusively through Fanatics,” Nazareth said. “We knew he doesn’t do these public signings. But finally, enough of us bit, and we did the event.” Each $3,600 ticket would get one item signed. Wagner bought 15 tickets, six for him, one each for Jarrett and Nazareth, and seven tickets for two other collectors. He paid a portion of the tickets with a credit card and arranged with Regato to pay the remainder in cash. The cash came from Regato, who purchased two game-used Super Bowl balls from Wagner at the event. Regato included those two Super Bowl items in the signing, ironically receiving subpar Brady autographs.  The items Wagner submitted were:  In the aftermath, Anzures admitted to knowing less than he should have about the signing’s details. But he also pledged to make things right. Some wanted a full refund. Wagner filed a dispute with his credit card company, which Anzures did not fight. That resulted in a partial $1,900 refund for each ticket bought. However, Wagner says Regato never reimbursed him for the portion paid in cash.  The tickets were purchased under Wagner’s name, and he felt responsible for getting the money back for his friends.  “He straight up told me he doesn’t have it,” Wagner said of Regato. “He said, ‘I have $8,000 to my name and you can have it.’ I didn’t want $8,000. I wanted the entire thing refunded.” Anzures fully refunded some collectors who were trying to get rookie cards signed, according to USA Today, because Brady did not sign them due to his exclusive autographed card deal with Fanatics. Wagner says Regato told him that Anzures even refunded some collectors their flights and hotels. SC Daily contacted Anzures on multiple occasions, but he did not respond to our interview request.  After the event, Jarrett decided to write directly to Brady via his official Facebook and Instagram accounts.  “I was heartbroken when I saw pictures of the signatures before meeting you,” Jarrett wrote. “I hate admitting it as a grown man, but I was fighting back tears telling you this because I had envisioned the moment so differently. But I had to speak up for what I felt was right.” He wrote him about the 2000 NFL Draft ticket he had purchased less than a year before the signing.  “This ticket meant a lot to me. I had spent years hunting it down, and there have only been three known to come up. For me, this item represented that no matter where others rank you, you can turn yourself into greatness by hard work and dedication. I considered myself blessed that my prized possession wasn’t as messed up as others, but it still hurts, and I wish I had never attended this event.” Jarrett never heard back from anyone.  Wagner is a well-known collector and dealer in the northeast and Massachusetts. He had done various signings with former Red Sox and Patriots players. He reached out to multiple players who could help connect him with Brady, but no one was willing to try.  “Nobody was willing to give us a shot,” Wagner said. “I had never seen anything like it. It’s like they were scared of him.” Within a week of the event in Miami, Jarret, Nazareth and Wagner were referred to a Florida law firm with experience working cases involving celebrities. Over five months, Jarrett and Nazareth discussed scenarios where they sued Anzures and EXMA, Brady, or both. But Jarrett and Nazareth increasingly felt it would be a difficult case. After all, Brady had signed their items – and it would be difficult to argue any intentionally malicious destruction of property.  Ultimately, the firm wanted a $50,000 retainer plus a contingency fee from any monetary wins. The three men countered with a higher percentage for the contingency fee and lower retainer, but the firm declined.  At the same time, Wagner was talking to a prominent Boston-based lawyer. The lawyer agreed to work on a contingency basis, but after a month he told Wagner there wasn’t a case.  “The lawyer was working on it for a month, and he came up with three things we could go after him for, but then he said they’re not valid points,” Wagner said. “He said, ‘If this ever goes to court, there’s no case.’”  Now, it appears that a lawsuit won’t happen. “We were getting exhausted with what was going on,” Jarrett said. “At the time, Derek had made a deal with Goldin Auctions, where he was going to auction off all of the items that he had signed as long as he had consigned all the items with them.” Wagner still felt the weight of the responsibility for being the point person between the collectors and Anzures/Regato. While he was able to file a successful claim with his credit card company, the group was still down $26,000 from the trip to Miami.  Wagner was contacted by a representative from Goldin Auctions, who felt they could sell his six items for a premium, given the provenance from the Miami event and because of the controversial autographs on them. Goldin would give Wagner a bonus for consigning all six items from the signing with the auction house. Wagner would use the bonus to make everyone “whole” from the event and compensate for the cash that was never reimbursed. Wagner would also keep whatever amount the items sold for. But after three signed items were auctioned off in late September, Wagner broke the contract and pulled the other three items from being auctioned off. “They were very confident the items were going to sell for more than normal pieces because they were from this high-profile event,” Wagner said. “But they sold for all-time lows because the autographs clearly destroyed them.” A game-used cleat signed by Brady sold for $4,575, with a buyer’s premium. In all, Wagner says he lost $22,000 with the sale of the three items, including what he paid to get them signed.  “I signed a contract saying they would sell my other three items, and I broke the contract,” Wagner said. “My goal was to refund these other guys in full. I didn’t mind getting rid of my stuff to help everyone out. But I couldn’t keep taking that kind of beating.”  As a result, Goldin revoked the bonus. Wagner still has the Brady to Gronkowski Super Bowl ball, a Super Bowl 55 photo-matched game ball, and a game-used ball from the 2000 NFL Hall of Fame Game – Brady’s pro debut.  All the collectors remain baffled by what happened that day.  They wonder why Brady signed the way he did. Nazareth believes Brady didn’t know those items belonged to collectors but might have thought they belonged to the event organizers trying to take advantage of him.  “I think he knew exactly what he was doing,” Nazareth says. “I’ve followed Brady since he was in high school. He’s humble, he’s friendly, I think he genuinely cares about his fan base. The speech he gave for an hour was amazing and it’s stuff like that that makes me love the guy. I think he thought he might’ve been doing it to people who were trying to get one over him. Trust me, I was not trying to get one over him.”  A fan outside of the Watsco Center who did not attend the event was lucky enough to have a football signed with a nice autograph.  The ticket Jarrett was so eager to have signed by Brady is now in a closet, hidden in a bin along with other Brady programs and items. The ticket was sent to JSA for authentication, where three months after being sent, the autograph was authenticated.    “I am planning on holding onto the ticket for right now,” Jarrett says, “but I’m not really sure what I will do with it going forward. I’ve been slowly selling some of my smaller Brady items, but the collectible market is down right now. If I could break even on all my items, I would sell it all.” Wagner wants to know why Brady signed the way he did. He doesn’t want money or anything else signed; he just wants a direct answer.  “I have completely lost every ounce of respect I had for Brady, which is terrible because I was one of the biggest Brady collectors out there,” Wagner said. “I just want the stuff out of my house. I would love to know why he did that. Maybe he wasn’t trying to be an a-hole. I don’t know his side.  “As much as Tom is a celebrity and a GOAT, he’s human. He could’ve lost his temper. Just let us know what happened unless he was really out to get us, which I would find really hard to believe.” Horacio is an educator and writer living in Staten Island, NY.

Sports Collectors Daily,1 of Few Surviving 1919 World Series Rings Consigned to Auction,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/1-of-few-surviving-1919-world-series-rings-consigned-to-auction/,"Sun, 10 Nov 2024 19:21:26 +0000",One of only a few known rings from the Reds-Black Sox World Series of 1919 is making its auction debut after consignment by the family of the Reds' shortstop.,"November 10, 2024 By Rich Mueller  It would become tainted by scandal, but the Cincinnati Reds weren’t about to let a championship go by without honoring those who made it happen.  Now, 105 years after it ended, a 1919 World Series ring has emerged and is on the auction block. Presented to shortstop Larry Kopf, the gold ring with a small diamond in the center, was a late consignment to next weekend’s Louisville Slugger Factory & Museum Auction by the Kopf family.  It’s expected to sell for $25,000-$50,000.   1919 World Series rings were originally created as 14k gold pins and are extremely rare.  Three, including one given to Kopf, were fashioned into rings. Championship rings didn’t become popular until later as they were associated more with women’s apparel at the time.  Kopf’s wife Erma wore the ring for many years and it has some moderate wear.  It has an inset diamond with a baseball field and “1919 World’s Champions” engraving. “The pin façade was then affixed atop a simple gold ring band with the perimeter of the top being slightly shortened and pin back removed during that same process,” Hunt Auctions notes in its auction description.  The Reds’ victory over the Chicago White Sox was an upset.  Gamblers struck a deal with members of the Sox to throw the series but after the deal soured, the Sox attempted to rally. However, the Reds emerged to win the first title in franchise history. Kopf was one of the better shortstops on the era. He played in all eight games of the series, collecting six hits, including a two-run triple in Game 2 and the go-ahead run in Game 4. Embed from Getty Images Hunt calls the ring “one of the most coveted baseball award scarcities of its type with relation to one of the most infamous events in the history of the game.” Bidding is open now and concludes this Saturday, with a live finale at the Louisville Slugger Factory & Museum.

Sports Collectors Daily,Veterans Day: Honoring Athletes Who Served,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/veterans-day-honoring-athletes-who-served/,"Sun, 10 Nov 2024 19:11:02 +0000","A look at a few athletes who put country, duty and honor ahead of sports and the cards we remember them by.","November 10, 2024 By Bob D'Angelo  As the United States honors its military veterans on this Veterans Day, it’s instructive to understand that some very real sacrifices were made by athletes to keep the country free. Some  paid with their lives; others sacrificed the primes of their athletic careers to serve in the military. Some are household names. Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio and Jackie Robinson come to mind. Hank Greenberg was the first American League player to register for America’s first peacetime draft, taking the oath on May 7, 1941. He was discharged on December 5, 1941, but re-enlisted the following February after Pearl Harbor was attacked two days after his honorable discharge. Greenberg would miss 3 1/2 seasons before returning in 1945. Others athletes have been obscured by history, but are just as important. One who comes to mind is Eddie Grant, one of the few players killed during World War I. The New York Giants had a plaque dedicated to his memory at the Polo Grounds on Memorial Day, 1921. It would take a lengthy series to mention all of those military heroes, but here are just a few: Jack Lummus
 Lummus was a defensive end for the New York Giants. One month after New York lost the NFL’s Eastern Division title to the Chicago Bears, Lummus became an officer in the Marine Corps. Lummus, who also starred collegiately at Baylor, distinguished himself at Iwo Jima in 1945 and received the Congressional Medal of Honor. He continued to fight despite being injured in the shoulder and helped his platoon eliminate fortified enemy positions. He stepped on a land mine, which blew off both his legs. As doctors tried to save him, Lummus was quoted as saying, “Well, doc, the New York Giants lost a mighty good end today.” Lummus was one of 23 NFL players killed during World War II.  He didn’t have any cards during his playing days but Tri-Star’s Obak series has honored him. Yogi Berra He might have been famous for his pithy statements and a stellar baseball career — three American League MVP awards, a 15-time all-star, and catcher/outfielder for 14 pennant winners (and 10 World Series champions) and manager for the 1964 A.L. champion Yankees — but Lawrence Peter Berra saw some major action during World War II. Berra served in the Navy from 1944 to 1945, joining the armed forces as an 18-year-old. He was a gunner’s mate on a landing craft on D-Day, as Allied troops stormed Omaha Beach on the Normandy coast on June 6, 1944. Berra told interviewer Keith Olbermann that the attack “was like the Fourth of July.” “I said, “Boy, it looks pretty, all the planes coming over.” And I was looking out and my officer said, “you better get your head down in here, if you want it on.’” Berra would keep his head and go on to a Hall of Fame baseball career, one that included cards and autographs from 1948-present. Bob Feller “Rapid Robert” won 266 games during his 18 seasons with the Cleveland Indians. He won 20 games six times, including 27 in 1940. He also lost nearly four years of pitching time, enlisting in the Navy the day after Pearl Harbor was attacked in 1941. In the three years leading up to his enlistment, Feller won 24, 27 and 25 games. When he returned from the war he put together 26- and 20-win seasons. It’s fair to say that Feller would have won more than 300 games had World War II not interrupted his career. Feller was signing autographs before a spring training game in Winter Haven, Florida, about a decade ago. One fan told him it was a shame that he lost so many prime seasons to the war effort. Feller didn’t even hesitate. “I’d do it all over again,” he said. Feller was not happy serving in a special physical fitness program. He enrolled in gunnery school and was assigned to the USS Alabama in late 1942. He spent the next 26 months as the Alabama’s chief specialist in charge of a crew that controlled the ship’s anti-aircraft equipment. Feller was involved in several battles in the Pacific, including skirmishes in the Gilbert and Marshall island chains.  He was used in numerous War-era advertising campaigns which are very popular collectibles today and appeared in the ‘Armed Forces’ subset of this year’s Panini Cooperstown set. Rocky Bleier After being drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1968 and playing a season, Bleier was drafted by the U.S. Army and shipped to Vietnam in May 1969. He was part of the 196th Light Infantry Brigade and took a load of shrapnel in his leg during fighting. He was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star, but doctors told Bleier he’d never play football again. Undaunted, Bleier returned to the Steelers in 1971 and became the blocking back for Franco Harris. He played 130 regular-season games and 10 playoff contests over the next decade and won four rings as a member of Pittsburgh’s four Super Bowl championship teams. Bleier included some Army inscriptions on this rather unique signed Steelers helmet.  His rookie card was in the 1975 Topps set and he appeared in a few others as well. Bob Kalsu He was an All-American offensive tackle in 1967 at Oklahoma, the year the Sooners went 10-1 and beat Tennessee in the Orange Bowl. Bob Kalsu was drafted in 1968 by the Buffalo Bills and by season’s end was voted the team’s rookie of the year. In 1969, he was called to serve in Vietnam, leaving his pregnant wife Jan and 10-month-old daughter Jill.  A 1st lieutenant for the 11th artillery unit of the 101st Airborne unit, Kalsu was killed on July 21, 1970, at the remote Firebase Ripcord in Thua Thien, along with 60 other fellow soldiers. At the time of his death, Kalsu and his unit had been pinned down for weeks by enemy fire. He was the only active NFL player to die in the Vietnam war. Early on July 23, 1970, Jan Kalsu gave birth to a son, named Robert Todd Kalsu. That afternoon, a uniformed Army officer informed the family of the death of Bob Kalsu. Later that night, Jan changed the boy’s name to James Robert Kalsu Jr. In 2000, the Bills added Kalsu’s name to the Wall of Fame at Ralph Wilson Stadium. Kalsu also appears in the Obak sets. Warren Spahn Spahn is the winningest left-handed pitcher in major-league history with 363 victories. He won 2o or more games 13 times and won the Cy Young Award in 1957, receiving 15 out of a possible 16 votes after a 21-11 season. Spahn made his major-league debut with the Boston Braves in 1942, but had no decisions in four games. He spent the next three seasons in the Army with the 276th Engineer Combat Battalion, the 1159th Engineer Combat Group. Spahn’s unit fought in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, and then monitored and protected the flow of traffic over the Ludendorff Bridge — the only bridge spanning the Rhine River that allowed passage into Germany. A staff sergeant, Spahn was injured by shards of shrapnel in his foot as the Germans maintained a steady, daily fire. Spahn was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart and was promoted to 1st lieutenant. Topps included him in its 2007 Distinguished Service set. Ted Williams  One of major-league baseball’s greatest hitters and the last player to bat .400 in a season, Williams had a career .344 average and hit 521 home runs. He won the Triple Crown in 1942 and ’47 and was a two-time American League MVP. Williams enlisted in the Navy after the 1942 season. His goal was to become a Naval fighter pilot, and by May 1944 he had earned his wings and was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant. Until June 1945, he served as an instructor with the U.S. Marine Corps reserves. Williams also served a second stint in the military, recall
ed in 1952 and deployed with Marine Aircraft Group 33 to Korea. Williams flew 39 combat missions over Korea before being relieved due to complications from an ear infection. He had missed most of the 1952 and ‘’53 baseball seasons, but returned full time in 1954 and remained with the Red Sox until his retirement after the 1960 season. He homered in his final at-bat, on September 28, 1960. His best cards span three decades. Pat Tillman Tillman would have turned 38 on November 6. He was the first NFL player to be killed in combat since Bob Kalsu in 1970. Tillman is the only player to ever give up a multimillion dollar contract to serve his country, and he did it voluntarily. Tillman turned down a three-year, $3.6 million offer from the Arizona Cardinals after the 2001 season and enlisted in the Army.  He appeared in the 2001 Upper Deck set. Joining the Army Rangers was motivated by the September 11 attacks. Tillman already was an all-pro safety with the Cardinals and was 25 in 2002, entering the prime of his career. He was deployed to Iraq, then was serving in Afghanistan when he was killed by friendly fire on April 22, 2004. After his death, the Pat Tillman Foundation was established, in hopes of inspiring and supporting individuals seeking positive change in themselves and the world. Eddie LeBaron The left-handed “Littlest General” was drafted by the Washington Redskins in 1950. He played two preseason games, then entered the Korean War as a 2nd lieutenant with the Marines. He was wounded twice during his nine-month hitch in Korea and won a Purple Heart. He also won a Bronze Star. LeBaron appears in several 1950s and 60s football sets. Forest K. Ferguson Jr. “Fergie” is the classic case of what could have been. The second All-American in University of Florida history, Ferguson set the pass receiving record at Florida with a 74-yard catch against Miami in 1941. He had received letters from several NFL teams, including the Steelers and Lions, but his mission after graduation was to enlist in the Army. Ferguson distinguished himself at D-Day, helping to blow a gap in the German lines on Omaha Beach. He was mortally wounded that day, halting his athletic career. Ferguson would die from his wounds in 1954, nearly 10 years to the day after the Normandy landings. Florida named an annual award after Ferguson, presenting it to the Gators senior who displays leadership and courage. I don’t believe any cards have been released of Ferguson, but I know of at least one recent book written about him. Bob has been a sportswriter and copy editor for more than 45 years and a blogger for two decades. He is celebrating his 60th year of card collecting, and still counts his 1965 Topps Mickey Mantle as his favorite.  You can reach him at [email protected].

Sports Collectors Daily,1974 WHA Canada-Soviet Summit Series Celebrates 50th Anniversary,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/1974-wha-canada-soviet-summit-series-celebrates-50th-anniversary/,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 02:31:40 +0000","Bobby Hull, Gordie Howe and others reflect on the 1974 WHA Canada-Soviet series as the ""Forgotten Series"" marks its 50th anniversary.","November 7, 2024 By Jeff Morris  Rick Smith reflected on the 50th anniversary of the second Canada-Soviet hockey series, which took place in the fall of 1974. Like the 1972 Summit Series, the second Canada-Soviet series was an eight-game affair with four games in Canada and then four in Moscow. The difference, however, was that the Canadian team would be comprised of WHA players and not NHL players. Smith, now 76, lives along a big lake near Westport, Ontario, north of Kingston. He makes sure he has a perfect sheet of ice on the lake through the winter, and is out on the blades almost daily. He still participates in alumni events with the Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators. “It was really exciting to be asked to play for Canada in the series,” Smith said. “It was more than a Canada-Russia thing for us. It was a chance for us to represent the WHA and show that we were on par with the NHL.” Smith won a Stanley Cup with the Boston Bruins in 1970 and was traded to the California Golden Seals in 1972. Bruins goalie Gerry Cheevers jumped to the WHA’s Cleveland Crusaders and thus was left off the 1972 Canadian team, as only NHL players were allowed to participate. Bobby Hull was among the other players left off the 1972 team. Cheevers pushed for Smith to be part of the team, as Smith was a steady defender who was always in position and fundamentally sound. By 1974, Smith was playing for the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the WHA. The bulk of the players on Team Canada were former NHLers who jumped to the new league. Frank Mahovlich, Paul Henderson and Pat Stapleton played in the 1972 series as they were still in the NHL. Gordie Howe and Bobby Hull did not play for Canada in 1972. Hull had jumped to the Winnipeg Jets for hockey’s first million-dollar contract. Howe retired before the 1972 series, but then came out of retirement the following year to join the Houston Aeros of the WHA and play with his sons, Mark and Marty. “I remember the time leading up to the 1972 series, and no one really thought they had a chance against the best players in the NHL,” Howe said during an interview with SCD several years ago. “They were amateurs, and they had won all these world championships, but they had never played actual professionals.” Howe, like every other hockey-loving Canadian, was shocked when the Soviets upset Team Canada 7-3 in the first game. What ensued was the most dramatic and globally important tournament in hockey history. “As the series went on, and the Canadians came together and won the series, all of us watched,” Howe said. “There was no way we could lose that series. It meant to much. All of these players who battled each other night after night for years all came together – the players playing for Canada as well as all of us at home watching on TV. I was 44 years old at the time and thought my hockey career was over, but as the series went on, I wished I was over there and a part of it. I think all of the NHL players watching probably felt the same way.” In 1974, Howe got the opportunity to play in the series with his sons, Mark and Marty. “I wasn’t sure what to expect, but the first time I put that Canada sweater on, it was a special feeling. Then I looked over in the dressing room and I saw Mark and Marty put their sweaters on. I was so proud as a father that my sons were playing for Canada. Getting to play with them for Canada in that series was a feeling I can’t really describe.” Howe was 46 years old in the 1974 series but was still a dominant force, as he had seven goals in seven games. Bobby Hull, meanwhile, was the player the world was watching. He led the tournament with seven goals and two assists for nine points in eight games. “I get asked about the 1976 Canada Cup a lot, and I am often asked about missing the 1972 series,” Hull said in an interview with SCD in the early 2000s. “But I rarely get asked about the 1974 series. “I was not happy about not being able to play in the 1972 series. That’s why I was so happy to get the chance to play for Canada in 1974. We had a very talented team and we were better than people thought we were. The series was not just a chance to play the Russians. It was a chance to show the world that our league was just as good as the NHL.” The feeling was different for Game 1 in 1974 compared to 1972. Hockey fans in Canada knew nothing about the Soviets when the 1972 series began. In 1974, the Soviet stars were household names in Canada. Aside from Howe, Hull, Henderson, Mahovlich and Cheevers, Canada had its share of household names on its roster. John “Pie” McKenzie, Rejean Houle, Ralph Backstrom, Mike “Shakey” Walton, Tom Webster, J.C. Tremblay and Rick Ley were among the stars on the team. Le Colisee in Quebec City only seated a little more than 15,000. There was a lottery in Quebec for the rights to buy tickets. Two million lottery tickets were sold for the rights to those 15,000 tickets. The WHA Team Canada got off to a better start than the 1972 team. Trailing 3-2, Hull scored the tying goal with 5:42 remaining. Canada had a chance to get the win late in the game. “I found Frank Mahovlich with a long pass and sent him in on a breakaway,” Smith recalled. “Unfortunately, Tretiak made the save, and I missed my chance to get on the scoresheet.” Smith did get on the scoresheet in the series, as he led Canada with 14 penalty minutes. Game 2 was played in Toronto, and Canada won 4-1. Game 3 in Winnipeg was won by the Soviets 8-5. In Game 4 in Vancouver, Hull scored three goals in the first period and Canada led 5-2, but the Soviets came back and managed a 5-5 tie. In Game 3, Canadian coach Billy Harris decided to sit some of the star players to let some of the other players get some playing time. Goalie Gerry Cheevers missed the game, as he was at the hospital tending to his father who was seriously ill. Don McLeod took his place. Howe, Mahovlich, Ley, House and Brad Selwood were all scratches for Canada in Game 3 in favor of players got their first taste of action in the series. “That changed everything for us,” Howe said. “We wanted to win. Once we realized that giving everyone ice time was more important than winning, the intensity seemed to disappear for us.” In 1972, some of the players on the roster who had been scratched and did not get playing time quit the team and went home. Harris wanted to avoid that from happened from his team, but he swung the pendulum too far the other way. In Game 4, with their “A” line-up back on the ice, the teams played to a 5-5 tie. Hull scored three goals in the first period, but the Soviets chipped away at Canada’s 5-2 lead. Late in the third period, Alexander Maltsev and Alexander Gusev scored for the Soviets to tie the game. “When I do autograph signings and meet fans, they often talk about their favorite moments of my career,” Hull said. “That hat trick was one of the biggest moments of my career. I scored three goals in one period against one of the greatest teams in the world. Maybe people forgot about it because they came back and tied the game and we didn’t win. No one ever brings that game up, but it is one of the biggest highlights of my career.” Hull and Howe were treated like celebrities and the Soviet hockey fans were warm and welcoming, though there were the usual complaints about accommodations and scheduling. “I wasn’t sure what to expect when we got to Moscow,” Howe recalled. “The fans were great. Even though we were rivals, they were very welcoming and they respected us.” The Soviets won Game 5 3-2, and then the frustrations of the Canadians began to show when they lost Game 6 5-2. “Mark put a big hit on Petrov,” Howe recalled, talking of his son. “Things got pretty heated after that. At the end of that game, Ricky Ley got in a fight with Valeri Kharlamov. He was their biggest star and he was a very good player. Rickey punched him out and Kharlamov’s face was bloodied up.” Kharlamov played at 5’8”, 165 pounds and was the most talented Soviet player. In the 1972 series, Bobby Clark broke Kharlamov’s ankle with a slash. The teams tied 4-4 in Game 7 and the Soviets won Game 8 3-2. Smith recalled that playing with Howe and Hull was a highlight of his career. “I played against those guys for years, but you don’t really get an appreciation for someone like that until you get a chance to be teammates and to paly with them,” he said. While in Ottawa in the 1990s, Tretiak talked openly about the two Summit Series, the Canada Cup, and the Super Series that saw Red Army come to North America to play NHL teams. “We didn’t know what to expect with the WHA team,” Tretiak said. “We knew about Bobby Hull and Gordie Howe, but we had never seen them or played against them. When we saw their roster, we thought they were very old and that they would not be able to keep up with us. “But even though they were older, they were better than we expected. Gordie Howe was still a great player, and bobby Hull was a great goal scorer. I thought that the 1974 team was better and harder to play against than the 1972 team.” The series gave the WHA exposure. While their TV contracts with CBS and CTV did not put a lot of games on the air, some was better than none. “Before the series, we heard everyone talk about Gordie playing with his sons, Paul Henderson playing the Russians again, Cheevers, Mahovlich and myself,” Hull said. “People who followed the series got to see how good Andre Lacroix was, and how good Mark Howe was.” After the series, O-Pee-Chee decided to produce their first WHA exclusive hockey card sets. The first was a 66-card set, while after that, the WHA sets featured 132 cards. But while there were Team Canada inserts in the 1972-73 O-Pee-Chee set, and while there were sets dedicated to the 1972 series and the 1976 Canada Cup, there is very little in the way of cardboard for the 1974 series. The odd retrospective autographed card of Hull, Howe and Cheevers have been produced, but for the most part, there is almost nothing to collect from that series. “I have signed a lot of autographs, photos, pucks and cards – everything,” Hull said. “When I do shows, the promoters always have stacks of 8x10s for fans to get signed. I never see photos from the 1974 series. It’s like they don’t exist.” Hull never called himself a collector, but he did get one special item after the series. “The Russians were great players, and it was a privilege to play against them,” he said. “Alexander Yakushev was their best scorer. After the series, he asked for my autograph, and I asked for his. I always wished some of those guys could have come to North America to play.” Jeff Morris is a hobby veteran who has been a collector for more than 50 years.

Jim Beauchamp, Mays’ teammate with the New York Mets, lent Mays one of his Adirondack bats when he stepped to the plate on August 17, 1973.

Mays proceeded to use the borrowed bat to hit what turned out to be his last big league dinger off Cincinnati’s Don Gullett.  The sale also includes some other landmark game-used lumber. A 1951 Ted Williams H&B bat graded PSA/DNA GU 10, a 1965-68 Roberto Clemente H&B bat graded PSA/DNA GU 9.5, and a 1967-68 Mays H&B bat graded PSA/DNA GU 10 will be among the featured lots as well as a1940’s Ty Cobb Signed H&B Pro Model bat Inscribed to the biological Mother of Babe Ruth’s daughter.    White trunks worn by Jordan during all three Chicago Bulls home games in the 1998 Finals are expected to draw interest from hard core basketball collectors.

The event, which also features No. 7 Duke and No. 23 Kentucky, is in Atlanta for the first time since 2012, when it was held at the Georgia Dome. The 2024 edition features the nation's top team, but its nothing new for the Jayhawks and Spartans to seek out early measuring sticks. Kansas (2-0) breezed past Howard 87-57 on Nov. 4 in its season opener before fending off No. 9 North Carolina 92-89 on Friday. The Jayhawks saw their 20-point, first-half lead disappear at home against the Tar Heels but scored the game's final five points for their first marquee win of the season. South Dakota State transfer guard Zeke Mayo led Kansas with 21 points off the bench, while fifth-year senior Hunter Dickinson recorded 20 points and 10 rebounds. Mayo, a Lawrence, Kan., native and last season's Summit League Player of the Year, leads his new team with an average of 20 points per game. ""(Zeke) met the opportunity with flying colors,"" Kansas coach Bill Self said of his performance on Friday. ""He was fantastic. He made a couple of plays off the bounce that were just fantastic. He was great, and we needed everything he gave us."" Alongside Mayo, Dickinson -- the Big 12 Preseason Player of the Year -- and KJ Adams Jr. return to the Jayhawks, averaging 18 and 10.5 points per game, respectively. Kansas is 8-5 all-time in the Champions Classic, including 2-2 against the Spartans.  The teams most recently met in the event in 2021, with Kansas winning 87-74. Even though his team is favored in Tuesday's game, Self knows not to underestimate a Tom Izzo-coached team. ""Playing Tom's teams is different because he runs more sets than anybody in the country,"" Self said. ""Getting your guys prepared for what they do, it'll be a multi-day scout."" The Spartans (2-0) have blown out two outmatched opponents this season, beating Monmouth 81-57 and Niagara 96-60. Michigan State's top two scorers are both returnees in Jaden Akins -- who is averaging 16.5 points a game -- and Jaxon Kohler (12.5).  Kohler had 20 points and 13 rebounds against Niagara in a lopsided victory, but Izzo knows Tuesday will be a different story. ""We were able to get the ball inside and outside; we had 52 points in the paint,"" Izzo said. ""I don't think that's going to happen on Tuesday night, but it's all about setting the tempo. What we've been doing well is what we've got to continue to do. I think we have some versatility inside and out, and I like the way we've moved the ball."" Michigan State is 5-8 in the Champions Classic, which began in 2011. After upsetting No. 4 Kentucky in the 2022 event in double overtime, 86-77 in Indianapolis, the Spartans fell to No. 9 Duke 74-65 last year in Chicago. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Although the Dolphins are 2-6 with three consecutive losses, Miami is far more competitive than the record indicates since starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa returned from a four-game hiatus on injured reserve with a concussion. Miami narrowly lost twice since Tagovailoa stepped back into the start job. The Dolphins dropped a one-point decision to Arizona and were also beaten by Buffalo by a field goal margin. As for the Rams (4-4), they'll look to keep their playoff hopes alive by extending their winning streak to four games and keeping their noses up with the rest of the pack in the NFC West. Given both teams' firepower on offense when healthy, this matchup looks tailor-made to produce a high-scoring affair.  --Dolphins' offense energized with Tagovailoa's return  The Dolphins scored 27 points in back-to-back games with Tagovailoa returning to rescue a group putting up less than two touchdowns per game without him. His presence alone tends to have a calming effect on the offense based on his accuracy and ability to put the ball exactly where he wants it to go. Tagovailoa completed 69.3 percent of his passes last season and is up to 72.7 percent this season. The Dolphins are more likely to remain on schedule with Tagovailoa, who has the fifth-highest success rate among quarterbacks with a minimum of 140 plays. When you're picking up the necessary yardage on early downs, you'll have more flexibility with your playcalling. In their last two games, the Dolphins converted 65.2 percent of their third-down opportunities and 6-for-8 in touchdown conversions inside the red zone. While the offense can sometimes resemble a slow grind, the Dolphins' efficiency under Tagovailoa makes them a real threat to opposing defenses. We're eyeing the over on Tagovailoa completions -- set at 21.5 at DraftKings, ESPN Bet and FanDuel -- given his high-percentage horizontal route connections with wide receivers Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle and the additional threat of running back De'Von Achane. Tagovailoa was 25 of 28 (89.3 percent) at Buffalo last week and 28 of 38 in his first game back from IR.  --Pass defense a mutual concern Los Angeles had its share of injury woes, with wide receivers Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua combining to miss seven games. Both players are now back with the team to significantly boost the Rams offense. The passing game is vital for the Rams because they struggle to run the ball, ranking 31st in yards per carry (3.8). As a result, it's no surprise that Los Angeles has the ninth-highest pass play rate at 58.68 percent. Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford should be eager for his chance to face this Dolphins defense. According to the FTN Fantasy Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA) metric, Miami ranks 27th against the pass. However, the Rams' pass defense is only one spot better.  Pro Football Focus offers a similar view. It has the Dolphins 26th in pass coverage while grading the Rams as the third worst in this category. Hence, we play the points. This total opened at 47.5 and was bet up as high as 49.5 before we began to see a little bit of buyback. It's now settling at 49 at most sportsbooks. As of Monday morning, 48.5 was still available at FanDuel. In a perfect scenario -- or close to perfect health for both teams -- this number would probably be closer to 52.  Do not pass: take the value and run with it.  Best bet: over 48.5 points (-115 at FanDuel) --Michael Nwaneri, Field Level Media Copyright 2024",
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Veteran’s Day Salute to Pro Athletes Who Served Their Country,https://deadspin.com/veterans-day-salute-to-pro-athletes-who-served-their-country/,2024-11-11T14:09:43.057Z,"On Veteran's Day, we salute the professional athletes who served the United States of America.","On D-Day, 19-year-old Yogi Berra and five Navy mates parked the USS Bayfield two long home runs from Omaha Beach and launched rockets and fired machine guns at the Germans—trying to smooth the way for the Allied invasion.  They stayed there 12 more days with orders to shoot down enemy aircraft.  Ted Williams, whose Boston Red Sox battled Berra’s New York Yankees hundreds of times during the 1940s and 1950s, served as a naval aviator for three years in World War II and gave 15 more months as a fighter pilot—occasionally serving as John Glenn’s wingman—in the Korean War. Before Williams left for his Korean War assignment, he had dinner with legendary sportswriter Grantland Rice. According to the superb book “The Wingmen: The Unlikely, Unusual, Unbreakable Friendship Between John Glenn and Ted Williams” by Adam Lazarus, Williams understood the stakes. “Then he said—and this is what I can’t get out of my mind,” Rice told fellow New York sportswriter Frank Graham, “(he said) ‘I expect to be killed, of course.’” Berra and Williams are two of the many examples of remarkable athletes who didn’t limit their greatness to the playing field—and risked their lives to do it. Veterans Day represents a wonderful opportunity to relive their sacrifices for the United States of America. Ty Cobb, Warren Spahn, Bobby Jones, David Robinson, Hank Greenberg, Chuck Bednarik and Hoyt Wilhelm are among other athletes who saw active duty or worked as intelligence officers. Bob Feller, who was perhaps the greatest pitcher of his day, enlisted in the Naval Reserve two days after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. Serving as a gun captain on the USS Alabama, Feller earned eight battle stars and six campaign ribbons in North Atlantic and Pacific theaters. After missing nearly four full seasons of his prime, Feller was discharged on Aug. 22, 1945, and earned a complete-game win over the World Series-bound Detroit Tigers two days later. By no means are former Major League Baseball legends the only ones to come to their country’s aid. After four years as a safety for the Arizona Cardinals, Pat Tillman and his brother, Kevin (an Anaheim Angels pitcher), enlisted in the Army in May 2002 as their response to 9/11. They trained to join the Army Rangers, and their regiment was deployed to Iraq and then Afghanistan as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Tillman was killed April 22, 2004, in Afghanistan by friendly fire during a firefight. Forty years before, Roger Staubach enjoyed a wondrous athletic career at Navy. In addition to earning the 1963 Heisman Trophy and being featured on the cover of Time magazine (he was pushed off the cover of Life due to John F. Kennedy’s assassination), Staubach excelled for three years on the baseball team (batting .420 as a sophomore) and received two letters on the basketball team. Upon graduation in 1965, Staubach immediately began to serve his five-year commitment to the Navy, which included one year in Vietnam. He entered the NFL in 1969 as a 27-year-old rookie with the Dallas Cowboys, who had the foresight to spend their 10th-round pick in the 1964 NFL Draft on Staubach. Within three years, Staubach led the Cowboys to the Super Bowl championship. He was awarded the Super Bowl MVP award, which came with a Dodge Charger. Staubach traded it in for a station wagon—the better to transport his three young kids.  Staubach’s Cowboys and Rocky Bleier’s Pittsburgh Steelers met more than once in the Super Bowl—and Bleier’s military journey was more harrowing than Staubach’s. After playing his rookie year in Pittsburgh, Bleier was drafted into the Army. He went to Vietnam and suffered multiple injuries in August 1969. He was shot in the thigh during an ambush. Not long after during that firefight, he saw a grenade bounce off his commanding officer’s back. “It rolls toward me and I wasn’t but three feet from him as I was sitting there,” Bleier told the American Veterans Center. “I got up to jump and it blew up and I was standing on top of it… I had nerve damage coming up out of my (right) foot, broken bones under my foot. Fortunately I didn’t lose any part of my foot.” During his lengthy recovery that included several surgeries, Bleier was told he would not play football again. Instead, he played 10 more seasons with the Steelers and won four Super Bowls to go with his Purple Heart and Silver Star. “Because I became a story and because we were successful, it put Vietnam on the top of the list,” Bleier said. “So all those Vietnam veterans out there who were repressed, who didn’t get the credit or the pat on the back, all of a sudden, here was one of ours that made it. And got through and got recognition for his service, which the rest of us can ride on his coattails or whatever it might be. But it was well-deserved (recognition) that we all should have gotten at that time.”  Copyright 2024",
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Philadelphia 76ers Star Joel Embiid Is Incapable of Taking the High Road,https://deadspin.com/philadelphia-76ers-star-joel-embiid-is-incapable-of-taking-the-high-road/,2024-11-11T14:02:05.448Z,"After serving a suspension for shoving a reporter in the locker room, Joel Embiid is incapable of taking the high road as the Sixers look to make up g","Joel Embiid has played in just 433 regular-season games since being the No. 3 overall pick of the 2014 NBA Draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. He has never once played 70 games in a season. And when Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes criticized Embiid's work ethic, lack of conditioning and pattern of unavailability, it didn't go over well with the 2022-23 NBA MVP. Embiid hasn't played yet this season due to a left knee injury plus the three-game suspension he earned for shoving Hayes after a game on Nov. 2. Embiid was irritated with the reporter for a few reasons, one being that he mentioned the name of the center's dead brother and young son, both named Arthur, in the highly critical column. Embiid certainly has the right to be upset and to deliver sharp words at the reporter—dang, what was the over-under on profane words during the confrontation? No matter what the topic, the second an athlete gets physical with a reporter, they have lost the battle and the war. While announcing the suspension, high-ranking NBA executive Joe Dumars included this nugget in his statement: ""Interactions must remain professional on both sides and can never turn physical."" Keep your hands off, Joel. You're 30 years old. You've been frustrated with the things this whole season. Instead of pushing somebody, have the team set you up with counseling to help figure out why you have so much anger. Embiid, of course, is a spectacular player who has career averages of 27.9 points and 11.2 rebounds. He led the NBA in scoring back-to-back seasons and had a solid chance to do so again last season before injuring the left knee in late January. He underwent surgery on Feb. 6 and later returned to action, but he hobbled through the playoffs. The knee certainly didn't recover because here he is still battling more issues with it. The 76ers need the seven-time All-Star on the floor to make a run at a title. But even with Embiid, Philadelphia hasn't reached the Eastern Conference finals during his career, let alone the NBA Finals. The more the 76ers come up short, the more people question whether Embiid will ever get Philadelphia to the finals. The 76ers last title came in 1983, when NBA MVP Moses Malone and basketball icon Julius Erving led the way. The 76ers added Paul George in the offseason to help with the title quest, and Tyrese Maxey, who just injured a hamstring, is also part of a star-studded trio. But no matter who you break it down, the 76ers need Embiid on the floor. They are a dreadful 2-7, and five of the losses have been by double digits. Embiid is eligible to return from his suspension on Tuesday against the New York Knicks. Those are the same Knicks that eliminated Philadelphia in the first round of last season's playoffs. There's no guarantee Embiid's knee will be ready for the contest against the Knicks. And that's kind of the real problem—when will that knee allow him to take the court and be a dominant force? Because once he's playing games and putting up 30-plus points every night, this whole situation will disappear. The focus will return to his skills, and the 76ers should start winning more games. But exploding on a reporter—even if the Arthur stuff was unnecessary—is not a good look for the so-called face of the franchise. Embiid has seemed to be one of those players that could spend his entire career with one organization. If that doesn't happen, consider the recent weeks as the beginning of the road out of town. Embiid made a big mistake. He'll choose his path moving forward. But big Joel, maybe keep your hands off the working stiffs in the future. Copyright 2024",

Houston was up 23-7 at intermission. Detroit quarterback Jared Goff had already been picked off three times, Texans counterpart C.J. Stroud had completed 70 percent of his passes, and the Lions had never faced such a deficit this season. What could go wrong? A lot, apparently. Detroit stormed all the way back, keeping Houston off the scoreboard in the second half and winning 26-23 on Jake Bates’ 52-yard field goal as time expired. So, make that three losses in four games for the once-mighty Texans, who were 5-1 through their first six games of the season. Injuries have been the main reason for Houston’s steady decline, with a bum hamstring forcing Nico Collins to miss the past five games and fellow wide receiver Stefon Diggs done for the year because of a torn ACL. If the Texans were in any other division than the AFC South, which currently features three teams that a handful of high school JV squads could probably give a run for their money, they would really be in a tight spot. But luckily for Houston, it still has some room for error. However, each setback gives the Indianapolis Colts a reason to keep chasing that division crown. Indianapolis (4-6) is the only team that the 6-4 Texans have to keep their eye on in the AFC South, as the Tennessee Titans (2-7) and Jacksonville Jaguars (2-8) might as well start scheduling offseason vacation plans. There’s a very real possibility that the Colts go 6-1 to close out the campaign. Yes, an optimistic prediction for sure, but colliding with the New York Jets, New England Patriots, New York Giants, Titans and Jaguars could result in a lot of late-season success.  Win those games, then beat either the Broncos or Lions, and congrats, Indianapolis. A 6-1 finish for a 10-7 record. Down Denver and Detroit, and now you’ve shattered all expectations.  Of course, this Colts team has plenty of problems of its own and hasn’t really been able to click all season despite having some serious talent, especially on the offensive side of the ball. Still, Indianapolis can say it has life, which a number of teams would kill for heading into Week 11. After a loss like the one it had on Sunday, Houston could easily go off the rails. It has great opportunities to bounce back ahead of its Week 14 bye -- facing the Dallas Cowboys, Titans and Jaguars -- but dropping any of those games really creates some cause for concern. Following their brief hiatus, the Texans will be greeted by a healthy version of the Miami Dolphins before taking on the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens. Then it’s down to Nashville for the regular-season finale against the Titans. Houston was already on a very slippery slope, and handing off a win to Detroit on Sunday certainly didn’t help it find its footing. The Texans shouldn’t be all that worried just yet, but if they do end up slipping in the standings, what happened in Week 10 won’t soon be forgotten. Copyright 2024",
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",It’s Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson Fight Week and I’m Embarrassingly Excited About It,https://deadspin.com/its-jake-paul-vs-mike-tyson-fight-week-and-im-embarrassingly-excited-about-it/,2024-11-11T13:48:13.575Z,"Jake Paul fights Mike Tyson on Friday November 15th on Netflix, and this fight is highly anticipated because of the unique nature of the matchup.","Top influencer boxer Jake Paul fights the legendary Mike Tyson on Friday, and I am embarrassed to admit just how excited I am for this.  The fight was originally scheduled for July 20, but had to be postponed after a medical scare for Tyson on an airplane, which was later diagnosed as an ulcer flare-up. Between these two dates, Paul hosted a surprisingly exciting fight against former UFC fighter Mike Perry, who had gained a little bit of fame for his success in the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship. Paul was named victorious by way of a technical knockout in the sixth round, as a swollen and beaten Perry just couldn’t proceed. Paul vs. Tyson comes with a fair amount of warranted criticism. Tyson is 58 years old. His last competitive fight was in 2005. In a 2020 exhibition against Roy Jones Jr. that ended in a draw, Tyson looked slow and like an older man that did not take the fight seriously. His fight against Paul will take place without headgear.  This fight with Paul will be different from your normal celebrity face-off, as it’s an actual sanctioned fight that will count on professional records.  This doesn’t feel like Logan Paul vs. Floyd Mayweather, which was a clear money grab. Don’t get me wrong, this is a massive money grab as well. It’ll be a huge spectacle at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys. While 80,000 can fit inside of that building, millions will watch this freak show live on Netflix. It’s another live event for Netflix, who impressed during their Labor Day broadcast of Joey Chestnut vs. Takeru Kobayashi. It’ll be interesting to see what Netflix can do with a combat sports broadcast. Another reason to be excited. But everyone will be interested in seeing what happens in the ring. Now 27 years old, Paul has taken the world of combat sports by storm. He’s knocked out former UFC stars like Tyron Woodley and Ben Askren. He’s battled older legends like Anderson Silva before. Prior to announcing his fight with Iron Mike, he was beating up some lesser-known boxers with relative ease. Tyson is a +200 underdog in this fight on most major sportsbooks, and that’s likely because of the 30-year age difference. But Tyson is different. He’s a heavyweight. This will be Paul’s first heavyweight bout, a division in which Tyson won six championship titles during his professional career. While training videos can easily be altered and edited, Tyson looks to be in great shape. At a heavier weight, Paul will presumably get tired quicker, and he’s never exactly been known for great endurance. Friday’s arrival will be met with excitement. A large piece of me feels like this could unfold like any other Paul fight, and that could be very apparent early in the match. The way Paul fights typically goes, he will strategically select an older, slower opponent that he could wear down with his heavy right hand. The opponents are typically in it for the pay day, and sometimes that’s very obvious with their clear lack of preparation. But there’s a small piece of me that thinks this one could be different. Surely, Tyson is in this one for the pay day, too. The legend has nothing left to prove inside of that ring. But if he could be the one to finally knock out Paul and put an end to all of this madness? That would be a story that only Netflix could script.  Copyright 2024",

The Thunder said Holmgren is expected to return this season after he endured a right iliac wing fracture. The 7-foot-1 star was injured during a fall after contesting a layup by Andrew Wiggins in the first quarter.  Holmgren, 22, is averaging 16.4 points, 8.7 rebounds and 2.6 blocks in 10 games this season.  The injury is the second significant one in the young career of Holmgren, who was selected by Oklahoma City with the second overall pick of the 2022 NBA Draft. He missed the 2022-23 season due to a Lisfranc injury in his right foot. Holmgren debuted last season and was runner-up for NBA Rookie of the Year after averaging 16.5 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocked shots in 82 starts. He became the first player in NBA history to tally at least 150 assists, 150 blocks and 100 made 3-pointers in a season.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Oklahoma City Thunder will have to adjust to being without one of theirs for the time being. On Monday night, the teams will square off in Oklahoma City with the Clippers still without Kawhi Leonard and the Thunder without Chet Holmgren. Leonard has yet to play this season due to inflammation in his right knee. He won't travel with the Clippers during a three-game trip that begins with Monday's contest. The game will be the second of four meetings between the teams this season. Oklahoma City won the first meeting, 105-92, in Los Angeles on Nov. 2. Holmgren played a significant role in that game with 10 points and 14 rebounds. Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said after that game that Holmgren's abilities made the Thunder particularly difficult to defend. But now, Oklahoma City will be without Holmgren for at least eight to 10 weeks after he sustained a pelvic fracture during the first quarter of Sunday's contest against the Golden State Warriors. Holmgren fell hard on his right hip after trying to defend a layup near the rim. The team announced the injury as a right iliac wing fracture and said he is expected to return this season.  Holmgren is averaging 16.4 points, 8.7 rebounds and 2.6 blocks a game this season. Oklahoma City trailed Sunday's game by 30 late in the third quarter before pulling as close as six late before the Warriors won 127-116. ""This is a resilient, tough, competitive, adaptive team,"" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said, ""and that's what we're going to be, regardless of the circumstances."" The Thunder might have to be even more adaptive. Before Holmgren's injury, Oklahoma City already was thin in the frontcourt with Isaiah Hartenstein, Jaylin Williams and Kenrich Williams all injured. Those three have not appeared in a game this season. ""It's kind of a next-man-up thing,"" Oklahoma City's Jalen Williams said. ""Can't dwell too long."" The Thunder's defense, which ranks best in the league with 100.3 points allowed per 100 possessions, figures to be most affected without Holmgren. ""All of us have to figure out how to get stops and rebound,"" Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. The Clippers' defense also is in the top five in the league, allowing 107.7 points per 100 possessions. After dropping their first matchup with the Thunder, the Clippers fell to 2-4 for the season. But Los Angeles has won four consecutive games since then, including Saturday's 105-103 home victory over Toronto. During the four-game winning streak, Clippers center Ivica Zubac is averaging 14.8 points and 12.3 rebounds. ""Zu's been great,"" Lue said. ""The big man that we've been playing a lot of minutes, but he's one of the most durable big men in the league, probably the most durable big man in the league."" Zubac has played in at least 68 games in each of the last four seasons. The Clippers have lost six consecutive games in Oklahoma City. They haven't won there since March 3, 2020. The Thunder are 2-0 on the second game of a back-to-back this season.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Spurs will play the third contest of a five-game homestand that's seen them split the first two games, defeating the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday and then dropping a 111-110 decision to the Utah Jazz on Saturday.  San Antonio on Saturday received 24 points and 16 rebounds from Victor Wembanyama, who was also called for a crucial offensive foul on a pick late in the game.  Stephon Castle had career-high 23 points in his third start, Devin Vassell scored 21, Keldon Johnson hit for 14 and Harrison Barnes tallied 10 points in the loss.  ""My guys have been in the gym with me,"" Castle said of his best-ever output. ""We're all confident in each other to shoot the ball no matter who it is. If we get open when we're told, we've got to shoot it. (It's about) just stepping up and shooting with confidence.""  Vassell's production came in his first action of the season after he missed more than seven months with a broken foot.  ""I haven't played in a long time,"" Vassell said afterward. ""You know, during the off season, I was kind of frustrated because at the end of the day, I just want to be out there on my teammates and play with them. I was able to get through it. They helped me get back in shape and everything.""  The Spurs have spilt their past four games and will get their first look this season at the Kings, who arrived in the Alamo City early Monday morning after a 127-118 overtime win in Phoenix on Sunday.  DeMar DeRozan led the Kings with 34 points while three other starters -- De'Aaron Fox (21 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists), Domantas Sabonis (20 points, 12 rebounds) and Keegan Murray (14 points, 14 rebounds) -- racked up double doubles in the victory. Kevin Huerter added 17 points for Sacramento.  The Kings have won three of their past four games.  While DeRozan is the most oft-mentioned new player for the Kings, Huerter -- who came to the team from Atlanta in July 2022 -- also has been a key cog. The 6-foot-7 guard underwent a 6 1/2-month recovery after season-ending surgery last April to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder.  ""I'm still getting myself in the swing of things, still trying to find my rhythm,"" said Huerter, who is averaging 11.3 points a game this season. ""A couple of new guys on our team and a new offense, so I'm trying to fully immerse myself with the team and kind of get my feet under me a little bit. It's been a rigorous summer, and obviously glad to be back in the swing."" Sacramento's super sixth man, Malik Monk, left Sunday's game early in the second quarter when he twisted his ankle after stepping on the foot step of Suns center Mason Plumlee. Monk did not return to the game, and his status for Monday's contest will be in question until game time. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Rockets eked out a 101-99 victory over the Pistons for their third win in the last four games. Houston, which will host the Washington Wizards on Monday night, beat Detroit while shooting just 40.9 percent from the field and missing 27 of 34 attempts from 3-point range. What the Rockets did well on Sunday was lean into their early-season profile by securing 17 offensive rebounds while recording a modest 11 turnovers. According to NBA.com, the Rockets exited the win over Detroit second in the league in offensive rebounding rate (35.9 percent) and fifth in turnover rate (12.5 percent). Their effectiveness in those two categories has offset woeful shooting, with only Portland and Utah posting effective field-goal percentages worse than the Rockets' 49.6 percent. Rebounding saved the Rockets against the Pistons. Alperen Sengun grabbed 10 rebounds while Tari Eason secured nine in 27 minutes off the bench. Starters Fred VanVleet and forward Jabari Smith Jr. shot a combined 5 for 21, including 1 for 11 on 3-pointers, but totaled 14 rebounds. The Rockets employ the offensive talent to turn things around on that end of the court, but their offensive rebounding and ball security should continue to serve as assets. ""That was a point of emphasis all year,"" Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. ""We got nine more shots because of that and took care of the ball. As I always say, you can rely on your defense when the shots aren't falling, so on the nights when they both click, you have a comfortable win. The nights where they're not, you can still dig it out and figure out a way to get it done."" The Wizards surrendered a pair of 30-point quarters in the second half of their 121-94 road loss to the Orlando Magic on Sunday, their fourth consecutive defeat, with three of those losses coming by at least 20 points. Washington again was without its second-leading scorer and rebounder, Kyle Kuzma (17 points, 7.7 rebounds), and his absence continues to be felt. Washington posted a minus-seven rebounding margin and allowed 15 offensive boards that Orlando converted into 22 points. The Wizards' ineffective performance on the glass was a shared responsibility, but 7-foot rookie Alex Sarr corraling only three rebounds in 24 minutes proved noteworthy. Sarr blocked two shots on Sunday after entering play averaging 2.6 per game, which ranked fourth in the NBA. If Sarr is to excel as a rim-protector, he'll need his teammates to cover for him on the glass when he rotates out of position and fills the role as a help defender. ""I think Alex is growing and learning every game,"" Wizards coach Brian Keefe said. ""We're seeing things that he's never seen before. ""I thought Alex came out and established a good presence at the rim early. We've got to keep helping him when he goes to shot-block and help him on the boards.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Then, on Saturday, Philadelphia battled the defending champion Florida Panthers for 65 minutes before falling 4-3 in a shootout. ""The past few games, we're beginning to play better, more to what we're supposed to play like,"" Flyers coach John Tortorella said. Samuel Ersson missed the first two games of the road trip with a lower-body injury before returning to make 28 saves against the Panthers. ""This road trip, I think we played pretty well,"" Ersson said. ""We battled ... against very good teams. We're happy with the way we played. Obviously we want more points, but if we play like this, they're going to come.""  Joel Farabee, Anthony Richard and Garnet Hathaway each scored a goal and Scott Laughton had two assists against Florida. Owen Tippett had the team's lone tally in five shootout attempts.  ""I thought we dictated the speed of the game tonight,"" Hathaway said. ""And that's something that when we're playing to our identity, that's what we do."" The Sharks are playing better in recent weeks, as well, having gone 5-2-0 in their last seven games following an 0-7-2 start to the season. Most recently, they slipped past the New Jersey Devils on Sunday night, 1-0, in the opener of a four-game trip. Mackenzie Blackwood made 44 saves for his 11th career shutout, blanking his former team in his first game as a visiting goaltender at Prudential Center. ""It's just one of those nights where it feels easy,"" Blackwood said. ""I don't know why sometimes that happens and sometimes it doesn't, but sometimes pucks just seem like they're coming in slow. I don't know why, but definitely you could say today was one of those days I was seeing the puck well."" While most teams typically don't start the same goalie on both ends of a back-to-back set, perhaps San Jose coach Ryan Warsofsky has a tougher decision to make after Blackwood's stellar effort on Sunday. ""(Blackwood) was outstanding, probably the best I've seen him play,"" Warsofsky said. ""You could just tell he was dialed in, focused and tracking pucks really well."" Of course, some credit must go to the Sharks' defense for shutting out a talented Devils team that entered with five wins in its previous six games. ""I thought we did a great job for the most part, staying tight,"" said Nico Sturm, who scored the lone goal for San Jose. ""Obviously, (Blackwood) had a huge game."" It remains to be seen if the Sharks' defense will have to contend with dynamic Flyers rookie Matvei Michkov, who has been a healthy scratch in the last two games. ""It's just part of the process,"" Tortorella said. ""With young guys, they can watch games too as far as developing. It's (about) trying to help him.""

His heroics helped the Lions (8-1) stretch their winning streak to seven games. Jared Goff threw a career-worst five interceptions while completing 15 of 30 passes for 240 yards and two touchdowns for Detroit. David Montgomery rushed for a touchdown and Amon-Ra St. Brown and Sam LaPorta had scoring receptions for the Lions. C.J.

The Bulldogs (1-1) fell 68-66 to the Governors on Friday, committing 16 turnovers and surrendering 44 points in the paint. Patrick McCaffery finished with a team-high 23 points on 8-for-13 shooting from the field for Butler, which struggled to create separation in the first half before going down by as many as 14 in the second.  Bulldogs coach Thad Matta is hoping that his team will be more resilient on Monday.  ""They just punched us early,"" Matta said of the Governors. ""We've got to get better at taking a punch and fighting back. We didn't handle (the pressure) well. They made us not ready to play."" McCaffery is one of four players who has a scoring average in double figures for Butler. He is putting up 17.0 points per game, ranking second behind Jahmyl Telfort, who averages 18.5 points.  Pierre Brooks II (13.0 points per game) and Finley Bizjack (10.0) have also been key contributors for the Bulldogs.  The Broncos (1-1) will have to find a way to contain that balanced attack after crushing Division II foe Davenport 86-46 on Thursday. Brandon Muntu supplied 17 points in the victory, while Max Burton and JaVaughn Hannah netted 13 apiece.  Western Michigan hasn't had a winning season since the 2017-18 campaign, but that isn't stopping Hannah from having high expectations for the Broncos.  ""We're not just satisfied with making the (Mid-American Conference) tournament. We want to kick in that door, take the next step and win a championship,"" Hannah said. ""That foundation is set. We just want to continue it this season.""  Hannah and Markhi Strickland are each averaging 11.5 points per game to lead Western Michigan in scoring.

UNCG (1-0) pulled away late from Florida Gulf Coast for a 73-64 win in its season opener last Monday. Though the Spartans led by as many as 17 points in the first half, FGCU tied the contest at 59-59 with 3:54 left in the second. That was promptly answered by an 11-0 run from UNC Greensboro, sealing the Spartans' victory. Offensively, the Mustangs are led by Wake Forest transfer Boopie Miller, who has averaged 20.5 points through his first two games with SMU. Donovan Atwell and Kenyon Giles each tallied 17 points in UNCG's season opener. SMU surrendered an average of 67.5 points in its first two victories, but the Mustangs also recorded at least 10 steals and forced their opponent into a minimum of 15 turnovers in both contests. Enfield reiterated the importance of quality defense to his team's identity after beating Florida A&M. ""I think through our preseason, we understand that if we don't play hard defensively, we're not very good,"" Enfield said. ""We have to be active. We have to be disruptive."" SMU enters the matchup Monday shooting 42 percent from beyond the arc and had 20 assists against Tarleton State and 23 against Florida A&M. ""They're buying into the team concept,"" Enfield said. For UNCG, team defense was the key down the stretch of its first win, holding FGCU to a scoring drought that spanned 3:25. ""We challenged these guys to get in better shape this season,"" Spartans coach Mike Jones said. ""We challenged them to be able to separate (themselves) in the last four minutes of the game because you're tougher mentally and better conditioned.

Tamar Bates hit 3 of 7 shots from behind the arc while leading Missouri with 17 points. But the other Tigers went 0-for-15 from distance while coach Dennis Gates implored them to pound the ball inside. ""The 3-pointer was so tempting for most of them, they couldn't resist it,"" Gates said. ""They could not resist it. And Bates made his baseline out, and it's almost like that that stirred it up again, like ‘Oh, we're open! We're open! Let's shoot it!' And we have to be able to do certain things other than just catch and shoot."" Forward Mark Mitchell had a strong game inside (16 points, eight rebounds), but Gates wanted more players attacking the basket. He used nine players for 12 minutes or more while trying to find effective combinations. Eastern Washington opened its season by losing at Colorado 76-56 and defeating Seattle 93-86 at home. The Eagles raced to a 16-4 lead over Seattle but failed to keep the upper hand, falling behind by the 7:53 mark of the first half. ""We'll get better defense because this is a very coachable group,"" first-year Eagles coach Dan Monson said. ""They have started both games dictating the defense, we just have to sustain it."" On the other hand, the Eagles shot 57.6 percent from the floor against Seattle and made 9 of 22 shots from 3-point range.

One of the bright spots for the Rattlers so far has been Sterling Young, who led the team in scoring against SMU with 15 points. He went 3-for-8 from 3-point range in that setback.  Young is averaging a team-high 15.5 points over the first two games of the season.  ""Sterling is a really good offensive player who was an all-conference player at the best juco conference in the county,"" Crarey said in May, when it was officially announced that Young had transferred from Charlotte. ""He spent this last year playing in the (American Athletic Conference). His experience on that level will be a huge asset to our program."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Hokies improved to 2-0 with a 93-74 win against visiting USC Upstate on Friday night, while the Eagles (2-0) defeated visiting Little Rock 82-67 Saturday. Mylyjael Poteat and Brandon Rechsteiner both scored a career-high 19 points in Virginia Tech's win. Freshman Tyler Johnson scored 16 points and Jaydon Young had 14. Despite the win, the young Hokies had a cold-shooting start on Friday. They missed nine of their first 10 shots and trailed 16-2 early. USC Upstate hit six of 10 shots to begin the game and Virginia Tech committed five turnovers early. Virginia Tech trailed by five at intermission but pulled away in the second half. A 7-0 run gave them a double-digit lead and they never looked back. ""I feel like that's a good definition of what the season will look like,"" Young said. ""I think it'll start off pretty ugly, as it should, new team coming together. I feel like a lot of teams look like that right now, but January, February, later on in the season, it might look a little better."" In contrast to Virginia Tech's youth, Winthrop starts five seniors and returns four starters, the top four scorers from 2023-24. Despite that, Winthrop followed a similar narrative to Virginia Tech last time out. The Eagles led Little Rock by four points at halftime before scoring the first nine points of the second half to build a 41-28 lead with 17:38 to play. They pushed the lead to 23 points and Little Rock got no closer than within 13. K.J. Doucet led Winthrop with 17 points and seven rebounds. Tommy Kamarad and Kasen Harrison added 13 points apiece.

Monday at home, the Panthers get another mid-major test against Gardner-Webb of the Big South. Helping fuel the Panthers' 2-0 start have been Damian Dunn, a graduate transfer from Houston, and Cameron Corhen, who arrived from Florida State. While Dunn had 19 points in an 83-68 victory Friday over Murray State, Corhen delivered 13 points and 10 rebounds. Meanwhile, holdover guards Jaland Lowe and Ishmael Leggett produced 20 and 19 points, respectively. While some backcourt players in the transfer portal might have crossed Pitt off their list because of the presence of two veteran guards, Dunn signed on and the trio has been productive. They are averaging a combined 54.5 points, hitting 54.5 percent of their shots, including 45.4 percent from beyond the arc. ""We all have our turns. We all know we have our days. Everybody's gonna eat,"" Dunn said. While the offense was humming last week, Pitt coach Jeff Capel wants to see more from his defense. ""We didn't play as hard and smart as we normally do,"" Capel said after the Murray State win. Zack Austin came off the bench to spark the defense with five blocks and eight rebounds. ""We're not as good as we think we are,"" Capel added. Gardner-Webb (1-1) arrives after delivering Jeremy Luther his first win as a Division I head coach, 88-82 at North Carolina Central on Friday in a game that the Runnin' Bulldogs never trailed. Anthony Selden, who returned to Gardner-Webb after a season at Rice, propelled the Runnin' Bulldogs with 26 points on 10-of-15 shooting.

Brett Leason, Jackson LaCombe, Leo Carlsson and Isac Lundestrom scored goals for Anaheim, which picked up just its second win in the past eight games.

Anaheim, which entered the game having scored an NHL-low 27 goals, jumped out to a 1-0 lead at the 3:13 mark of the first period on Leason's first goal of the season. Cutter Gauthier set up the score with a backhand pass from below the goal line to Leason in front of the crease.   Columbus, playing the second half of a back-to-back set that began with a 5-2 loss at Los Angeles on Saturday, tied it near the end of the period on a power-play goal by Chinakhov. He blasted a one-timer from the right point that squeaked past Gibson for his fourth goal of the season.   Anaheim took a 2-1 at 4:22 of the second period when LaCombe roofed in a rebound of a Radko Gudas one-timer from the top of the crease for his first goal.   Carlsson made it 3-1 at 10:20 of the third period with a spinning wrist shot from the slot off Brian Dumoulin's pass for his fifth goal.

Tyler Herro scored a game-high 26 points on 9-for-15 shooting from the floor for Miami, which ended a three-game losing streak. Jovic scored 15 points and grabbed seven rebounds off the bench, and Terry Rozier chipped in 11 points.   Anthony Edwards scored 24 points but made only 8 of 22 shots for Minnesota, which saw its three-game winning streak end. Julius Randle finished with 17 points, six rebounds and six assists, and Naz Reid contributed 15 points off the bench.   On the decisive play, Jovic sprinted toward the basket and caught an inbound pass in stride from Duncan Robinson. Jovic finished at the rim and drew a foul against Timberwolves defender Nickeil Alexander-Walker.   The play spoiled what could have been a game-winning basket for Jaden McDaniels, who made a putback shot with nine seconds to go to give Minnesota a 94-92 lead.   The Timberwolves led 92-89 before Haywood Highsmith and Rozier combined for three free throws in the final minute to even the score at 92-92.

Jonathan Kuminga scored 12 of his 20 points for the Warriors in the second quarter and shot 8-of-11 from the field.  De'Anthony Melton hit five of Golden State's season-high-tying 21 3-pointers and finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 24 points but was just 6-of-17 from the field, including 1-for-5 in the fourth quarter.  Oklahoma City played most of the game without star center Chet Holmgren, who injured his right hip on a hard fall after a midair collision with the Warriors' Andrew Wiggins in the first quarter. Holmgren finished scoreless for the first time in his career, going 0-for-3 from the field, and had four rebounds. The Thunder trailed 107-77 late in the third but got within 114-108 in the fourth after Alex Caruso stole an inbounds pass and streaked to the other end for a dunk. Oklahoma City immediately forced another turnover, this one by Curry, but couldn't take advantage again. Golden State scored on its next two possessions, the latter coming on Curry's sixth 3-pointer that made it 119-108 with 3:23 remaining.  Curry scored five more points the rest of the way as the Thunder never got closer than seven. The Warriors outshot the hosts 50.6 percent (45-of-89) to 44.7 percent (42-of-94) and held Oklahoma City to 11-of-33 shooting (33.3 percent) on 3-pointers. The Thunder initially responded well after Holmgren's injury, stretching their lead to seven by the end of the first quarter. Golden State turned things around in the second, outscoring the Thunder 39-25 to carry a 65-58 lead into halftime. The Warriors' surge continued in the third quarter as Curry exploded for 17 points.

Mrazek outdueled Minnesota counterpart Filip Gustavsson (20 saves) to help Chicago end a 12-game winless streak against its Central Division rival. The Blackhawks netted the game-winner after intercepting a pass. Seth Jones sent a pass to Kurashev, who streaked down the left side before beating Gustavsson with a wrist shot. The Blackhawks fought off consistent pressure from the Wild, who outshot Chicago 19-4 in the third period. Matt Boldy evened the score at 15:29 of the third period, burying a chance when a rebound trickled to him just inside the left circle. Boldy missed an opportunity to tie the score moments earlier, sending a shot off the crossbar that glanced off Mrazek's body before Nick Foligno poked it away from the net. Chicago's Ryan Donato hit the post shortly after the goal. The Blackhawks opened the scoring at 16:44 of the first period, when Jason Dickinson tallied an unassisted goal. Swooping in to gather a loose puck along the right-wing boards, he came through the circle and moved into the slot before sending a wrist shot over Gustavsson's blocker. Chicago was awarded two power plays on separate tripping calls in the first 5:50 of the game but failed to convert. Mrazek proved especially resourceful in the closing seconds of the second period. After losing his stick in front of the crease, he accepted Taylor Hall's stick and used it to stop Jake Middleton's wrist shot from the left circle. Wild coach John Hynes shuffled lines in stretches during the game, including grouping Kirill Kaprizov, Joel Eriksson Ek and Boldy. Kaprizov saw his streak of eight consecutive multipoint road games snapped, although he did get the primary assist on Boldy's goal. Kaprizov entered the game with back-to-back three-point efforts to begin Minnesota's three-game road trip. Both teams were 0-for-3 on the power play. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

UCLA (1-1) gave up 21 points off 21 turnovers in a 72-64 loss to New Mexico on Friday in Henderson, Nev. The 21 turnovers were the most by a Mick Cronin-coached team since his first season at UCLA, 2019-20, when the Bruins had 22 turnovers vs. North Carolina.  ""I'm extremely disappointed in some of our guards,"" Cronin said. ""There are three things you've got to do: defend, rebound, and take care of the ball. We didn't take care of the ball."" Maintaining possession has been a hallmark of Cronin's UCLA teams. The Bruins averaged fewer than 11 turnovers per game in each of the previous four seasons. In 2021-22, UCLA averaged just 8.9 turnovers a contest.  Rediscovering that identity promises to be a point of emphasis for a veteran, but still new-look Bruins lineup. Four of the five starters against New Mexico are transfers: Eric Dailey Jr., Skyy Clark, Kobe Johnson and Tyler Bilodeau.  Meanwhile, the lone returning starter -- Dylan Andrews -- scored just four points while committing six turnovers on Friday.  Andrews, Sebastian Mack and Lazar Stefanovic, three of UCLA's top performers a season ago, combined for just eight points vs. New Mexico.  ""Dylan and Sebastian were throwing the ball away for layups,"" Cronin said. ""I told them, ‘Guys, we were better than that last year.'"" Just one Bruin scored in double figures on Friday -- Bilodeau with 23 points -- after four Bruins notched at least 12 points in their 85-50 season-opening win over Rider on Nov. 4. UCLA aims to regain that balance when winless Boston University comes to Pauley Pavilion.  The Terriers (0-2) come into the matchup after losing 74-60 at San Diego on Friday. Boston gave up 40 second-half points to the Toreros after surrendering 42 second-half points in its 80-72 loss to crosstown rival Northeastern on opening night.  Forward Malcolm Chimezie was a bright spot for Boston in its first two games. After scoring 14 points against Northeastern, he had nine points and nine rebounds at San Diego.  Boston guard Ben Palacios, who missed the season opener, scored 15 points in 17 minutes off the bench against San Diego. The Terriers head into UCLA missing forward Otto Landrum, who averaged 8.5 points and 5.3 rebounds a season ago; and guard Ethan Okwuosa, who averaged 7.5 points and 4.2 rebounds last season.  ""This is going to be our team for a while. We're going to be without Ethan and Otto for a good stretch, and we're going to have to figure this out,"" Terriers coach Joe Jones. ""This is not the same team from last year because of the injuries, but we're still a good enough team to win. We're going to have to figure it out.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Diebler is in his first full campaign as head coach for Ohio State after replacing the fired Chris Holtmann on Feb. 14. Diebler went 8-3 as the Buckeyes' interim head coach last season. Sharp 3-point shooting was key for Ohio State (1-0) against the Longhorns. The Buckeyes shot 14-of-28 from distance, 50 percent clip they surpassed only four times last season. ""We really just want to get a good look,"" Diebler said. ""We want to play with an aggressiveness and confidence to take the first good look we can get."" Youngstown State's Ethan Faulkner won his head coaching debut for the Penguins (1-0) with an 80-60 victory at Chicago State on Saturday.  Faulkner was the associate head coach the past two seasons after three as an assistant coach at Youngstown State. It was a delayed start of the season for the Penguins because the originally scheduled opener against Westminster on Nov. 4 was postponed due to a power outage on the Youngstown State campus. The Penguins have won 20 games in consecutive seasons, but Faulkner has only three returning letterwinners and knows his team is a work in progress.  ""We are certainly making progress, but I think we need to continue to improve in all areas,"" Faulkner told the Tribune Chronicle.

After a 20-17 overtime loss in Germany at the hands of Bryce Young’s Carolina Panthers, the Giants are 2-8. Now let’s be clear on something. Nobody really expected the Giants to be much of anything this year. They pretty much waved the white flag on 2024 when they let the best running back in the game, Saquon Barkley, walk away to a division rival on a long-term deal back in March. Their 2-8 record isn’t as embarrassing when you realize that it should not be unexpected. Despite never showing the true, intangible traits of a Super Bowl-caliber quarterback, the Giants decided to extend Jones to a four-year, $160 million contract. Everyone online trolls Jones for his ineptitude, but that’s just who he is as a quarterback. It’s who he has always been. It’s who he will always be. But it’s time to move on. The contract has an out this offseason and the Giants would be flatout stupid to not exercise that clause. They likely will. Remember, they were in on several quarterbacks in the 2024 NFL Draft class, but ultimately selected wide receiver Malik Nabers with the No. 6 overall selection. Moving off of the No. 6 overall pick in 2019, Jones would cost the Giants about $22 million in dead cap space, but that’s not that much money as long as your new quarterback is still on his rookie deal. It’s practically how the Denver Broncos have their head above water after the Russell Wilson fiasco, which is comedically working out for the Pittsburgh Steelers as well. But Jones isn’t a solo actor in the crime of the 2024 Giants. Daboll shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near the next quarterback. Neither should offensive coordinator Mike Kafka.  It’s time for a fresh start with a fresh quarterback.  Jones has a 22-44-1 record as the starter for the Giants. Replacing Eli Manning was never going to be easy, but Jones probably was never going to be the guy to make that happen. Dynasties in football are rare. Not everyone can be the Green Bay Packers, who consistently spit out franchise quarterbacks. The Steelers have struggled to replace Ben Roethlisberger since his retirement. After Tom Brady's departure, the New England Patriots have already drafted two different first round QBs. These guys don't exactly grow on trees. There's no guarantee that the next guy will be a hit for the Giants, and that goes for the coach or quarterback. But it can’t really be much worse than what they have now. Copyright 2024",

It was the Magic's second straight win without injured star Paolo Banchero, who last played Oct. 30 because of a torn oblique. Eleven different players scored for the Magic, six in double figures, with Cole Anthony scoring a season-high 16 off the bench. Washington has lost four in a row, and their scoring output was their lowest of the season. The Wizards' starting lineup included three rookies (Alex Sarr, Kyshawn George and Carlton Carrington) and second-year pro Bilal Coulibaly, who scored 20.  Jordan Poole led the Wizards with 24 points on 8 of 19 from the floor, including 3 of 10 from 3-point range. Carrington was hurt when Moritz Wager fell into his leg with 4:49 left in the game. He did not return. Orlando broke open a five-point game at halftime with a big third quarter, outscoring Washington 30-16. The Magic put together a game-changing 13-2 run capped by a traditional three-point play by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to make it 77-62 in 6:25 left in the third. The lead changed hands in the first quarter with the Wizards taking a 15-12 advantage on a three by Sarr, but Orlando closed the quarter strong. Moritz Wagner and Franz Wagner made back-to-back threes to give Orlando a 24-20 lead, and they maintained a four-point edge after one. George got hot for Washington in the second quarter, making four threes, but the Wizards' defense collapsed. The Magic went on a 10-0 run with rookie Tristan Da Silva making a corner three followed by a three by Caldwell-Pope, Fritz Wagner's layup and a two-pointer from Da Silva to go up 54-40. George answered for the Wizards with eight straight points, including two threes, but the Magic led 61-56 at half.  The third quarter was all Magic. Poole collected three quick fouls in the first three minutes, giving him four for the game, and went to the bench. The Magic capitalized. Franz Wagner converted a traditional three-point play, Jalen Suggs sank a three and the Magic led 83-66 with 3:15 left in the quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Vegas is 8-0-0 at T-Mobile Arena this season, outscoring its opponents an impressive 43-19 in the process. The eight-game home unbeaten streak matches the team record set in its inaugural season in 2017-18 when the Golden Knights made a storybook run to the Stanley Cup Final. The home-ice success is the main reason the Golden Knights are just one point behind the first-place Los Angeles Kings in the Pacific Division. Vegas has won just once in six road games (1-3-2). The Golden Knights return from a two-game road trip that saw them pick up their first road win of the season, 4-2, at Edmonton on Wednesday, and then follow that up with a 4-3 overtime loss at Seattle on Friday. Vegas jumped out to a 2-0 first-period lead over the Kraken but needed a fortunate 6-on-5 goal by Alex Pietrangelo with 1:22 to go to force overtime. Pietrangelo was attempting a pass that deflected in off the skate of Seattle defenseman Adam Larsson to tie it, 3-3. Jared McCann scored on a breakaway 29 seconds into overtime to win it for the Kraken. ""We got three of a possible four (points) on the road trip, so it's definitely a step in the right direction, but we definitely have some things to clean up, too,"" forward Tanner Pearson said. ""We wanted four (points), three's pretty good,"" Golden Knights coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""If you look at the big picture that part is pretty good. I just felt we certainly had a chance to get all four. We let that get away."" The win over the Oilers was a costly one, however. Captain Mark Stone, second on the team with 21 points (six goals, 15 assists) suffered a lower-body injury that kept him out of the Seattle loss. ""Day-to-day but we don't anticipate that he'll play (Monday),"" Cassidy said of Stone's status. Carolina had an eight-game winning streak snapped with a 6-4 loss to Colorado on Saturday night. The Hurricanes had to fly to Denver on the morning of the game because of extreme winter weather on Friday and the long day of travel, combined with the mile-high altitude, seemed to take its toll on Rod Brind'Amour's squad as the contest went on. Carolina took a 3-2 lead in the second period on a power-play goal by Martin Necas, but Colorado answered with three goals over a three-minute span at the end of the period to build a 5-3 cushion. The Hurricanes cut it to 5-4 on Jordan Martinook's second goal of the game early in the third period, but Mikko Rantanen sealed the victory for the Avalanche with an empty-netter with 50 seconds remaining. Brind'Amour refused to use his team's travel problems as an excuse for their first loss since Oct. 19 at St. Louis. ""There's no excuses because we came out really well,"" Brind'Amour said. ""But once we got into it, you could see that we were just hanging on really, and you can't hang on against that team. We had a couple guys (who) just didn't have it tonight. You could see we were just out of gas."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Penguins sent down their former top netminder, who led the league with six shutouts last season, to AHL affiliate Wilkes-Barre/Scranton on Oct. 24 after he struggled mightily on the ice. In three games with the top club, Jarry yielded 12 goals on just 73 shots. He stayed on the ice less than 12 minutes in his last game with the Penguins, giving up three goals on just five shots against the Buffalo Sabres on Oct. 16, a game that Pittsburgh rallied to win 6-5 in overtime. Jarry went 4-1 in five games in the AHL with a 2.16 goals-against average. He told reporters Sunday that he appreciated being able to play consecutive games. Whether he gets that chance immediately with Pittsburgh, which earned three points on its three-game road trip, will be up to coach Mike Sullivan. The longtime leader behind the bench now has three goalies from which to choose. While praising Jarry, he did not say whether he'd immediately come back to the No. 1 position. ""I think one of the potential benefits of it is, one of them will have an opportunity to get quality practice time if that particular goalie isn't backing up,"" Sullivan told reporters Sunday. ""For example, this week, we got four games this week. There's a lot of opportunity there."" Pittsburgh capped its road trip with a 4-2 win Friday over the rival Washington Capitals. The Stars, meanwhile, are finally getting back into the swing of things after playing two games in Finland against the defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers to start the month. They had five days off before the two-game, two-day series, and then another four days off before beating the Chicago Blackhawks 3-1 on Thursday. On Saturday, Dallas lost 4-1 at Winnipeg, which has lost only once in 15 games this season. Much like the two games in Finland, which the Stars lost to the Panthers, Dallas coach Peter DeBoer said Saturday's game was also a chance to see where his team ranks among Cup contenders. Winnipeg jumped out to a 4-0 lead with more than 12 minutes left in the second period. DeBoer pulled netminder Jake Oettinger midway through the game after giving up the four goals on just 15 shots. ""I think so,"" DeBoer told reporters after the loss. ""I think when you look at these guys and Florida, you know, they've exposed us, and we've got to be a lot better. I think we've beaten the teams we should beat, but when we've had opportunities to play the top teams in the league, we haven't risen to the occasion."" The game will also be a showcase for some of the top veteran scorers in the league. Stars center Matt Duchene, 33, leads the team with seven goals and 15 points. Right behind him in goals with six is 32-year-old Tyler Seguin. For Pittsburgh, the ageless duo of Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby continues to lead the way.

Heading into a clash with the host Calgary Flames on Monday, the Kings have not lost consecutive games since the first week of the season. ""That's character and will to win, and veteran leadership,"" Los Angeles coach Jim Hiller said. ""Those guys have to get out there and organize the team without practicing much. If you don't have veteran guys or leadership like we have, it makes it pretty tough."" The Kings are set to open a quick two-game road swing on the heels of a 5-2 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Saturday and have won six of their past nine outings. Los Angeles showed the ability to bounce back during its win on Saturday, which followed a 4-2 loss to the Vancouver Canucks on Thursday.  ""After a loss, you want to come out with a good response,"" Kings defenseman Mikey Anderson said. ""First period, we all thought was so/so but we liked it a lot better in the second, so everyone is happy to come away with two points."" The team's defensemen have combined for 11 goals this season, tied for tops in the league, thanks to another couple against the Blue Jackets. ""Our forwards help us, they get to the net hard,"" Anderson said. ""They've done a good job creating traffic and we're just trying to shoot, get something down there and create something for them to get grinding."" Kings forward Phillip Danault is riding an assist streak of five games, with six points (one goal, five assists) during that run. The Flames return home after a good-news, bad-news three-game road trip that ended with a 3-2 shootout loss to the Sabres on Saturday. Calgary's 1-0-2 trip started with a victory against the Montreal Canadiens before the Flames fell in consecutive extra-time meetings with the Boston Bruins and Buffalo.  ""Four of six points. Not great, not just OK, but good,"" Calgary defenseman MacKenzie Weegar assessed. ""Battled back in a few games to get points, but you know, we come back next road trip, we want to win these games, not just get one point."" The Flames trailed in the third period during all three games of the trip. The comebacks are a point of pride, but Calgary is aware that good teams don't trail time and time again. ""We know that we've got to be better going home now,"" Calgary captain Mikael Backlund said. ""We know first period's going to be a big key for us. It's great that we (came) back and showed character, resilience, staying in every game, fighting back and get points, but if you want to win games, we've got to start to have better first periods."" That said, Calgary coach Ryan Huska is not about to criticize his players too much. The Flames have gained points in four of their past five games and are hanging tough in the standings. ""There's a lot of good things,"" Huska said. ""There's areas that we have to work on, and they're the common things that we'll continue to hammer on with our players."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Colorado hung on to win, splitting its last two games because goaltender Alexandar Georgiev seems to have found his confidence. Georgiev was pulled from his first two starts and appeared to have lost his grip on the No. 1 role, but he has turned it around. He will likely be in net Monday night in Denver when the Avalanche play the Nashville Predators in the second of a four-game homestand. Georgiev was strong in a 1-0 loss at Winnipeg on Thursday night, and big saves in the first period against Carolina on Saturday night gave Colorado a chance to rally to a 6-4 win. ""I felt like that game could have got away from us in the first 10 minutes and it didn't, and that was because of Georgie,"" Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. ""He just gave our team a chance to come around. And that's what we need from our goaltending."" If Georgiev can keep performing, it bodes well for Colorado as it starts getting other players back. Miles Wood has been out two weeks with an upper-body injury but skated with the team on Sunday. Jonathan Drouin (upper body) hasn't played since the opener but is trending towards a return and Bednar confirmed Sunday that Valeri Nichushkin, who has been suspended since last May, will be in the lineup Friday night against Washington. The Avalanche have plugged holes to get through the beginning of the season, and it helps having Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar in the lineup. MacKinnon had four points in the win over the Hurricanes to move atop the scoring leaders, and Makar leads NHL defensemen with 24 points. Despite their production, Colorado has a losing record. ""All you can do is have a great effort and we've been doing that. Probably Chicago, at home, was our last bad game. We've been playing really well. I think we deserve more wins than we've gotten,"" MacKinnon said. Nashville enters Monday night's game having lost five of its last seven. One of the two wins came against the Avalanche on Nov. 2 and the other was Saturday night's 4-0 win over the Utah Hockey Club. Forward Jonathan Marchessault had a goal, just his third in 15 games, but he isn't concerned about his low output. ""Sometimes it's about getting chances, and I felt tonight I had a couple chances,"" Marchessault said. ""So that's a positive. Score or don't score, I think at the end of the day I just want scoring chances. That means I'm doing something good. And create chances for my teammates as well."" The Predators have been streaky this season, just like Colorado. They lost their first five, then won three straight before this latest stretch. Forsberg, who leads the team with eight goals, scored twice Saturday night. ""To see (Forsberg) be (Forsberg) and take over a game was really important for our group,"" coach Andrew Brunette said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

To begin round-robin action in the Ilie Nastase Group, Sinner defeated No. 7 seed Alex de Minaur of Australia 6-3, 6-4, and Fritz upended Russian fourth seed Daniil Medvedev 6-4, 6-3. The top eight players on the ATP Tour reached the season-ending Finals and were drawn into two groups. The top two players after the group stage will move on to a four-man knockout round. The other group features Alexander Zverev of Germany, Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, Norway's Casper Ruud and Russia's Andrey Rublev. Novak Djokovic, who won the last two years, is not competing due to injury. On Sunday, Sinner hit eight aces with just one double fault and finished the match with an 18-7 advantage in total winners as he coasted past de Minaur in an hour and 25 minutes. ""I'm glad that I managed to play this kind of level,"" said Sinner, who lost to Djokovic in the championship match last year. ""It's a great start for my side for this event, for this tournament, considering I haven't played an official match in four weeks. ""Every match, it's very difficult to play against (de Minaur). He's a great fighter. You have to earn every point you play. Every time we play, he changes a couple of things, so I have to be very aware. It's very difficult. We don't have to see only the result, but also how the match goes."" Fritz's serve was his biggest strength in his opening match. He won 33 of his 39 first-service points (84.6 percent) and hit nine aces without a double fault. By contrast, Medvedev had eight aces but suffered eight double faults. ""(The serve) was a big part of it for sure,"" Fritz said. ""(Medvedev) is such a good returner. You can make a lot of first serves, but if they are not very high quality, he just puts so many returns in the court. ""It was huge for me. I hit a lot of lines, a lot of spots to start out games."" Fritz and Sinner are scheduled to square off on Tuesday for their second group match, following Medvedev facing de Minaur. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The school told media outlets on Sunday that there has been no change in Golden's employment status. ""Todd Golden's status as UF men's basketball coach has not changed. He will be coaching the game Monday night,"" a school spokesman told ESPN. Golden released a statement Saturday that acknowledged the investigation and said he has been in touch with attorney Ken Turkel and considering filing a defamation suit. ""For the last month, I have actively participated in and respected the confidentiality of an ongoing school inquiry,"" Golden wrote on social media. ""I have recently engaged (attorney) Ken Turkel to advise me on my ability to bring defamation claims while this confidential investigation is ongoing. My family and I appreciate the support we have received and remain confident the university will continue its efforts to finish its review promptly."" The Alligator, a Florida student publication, cited Title IX documents filed on Sept. 27 that said Golden has been accused of potential violations of the school's Gender Equity Policy. They include acts of sexual exploitation, sexual harassment and the stalking of Florida students over the past year. Per the report, Golden sent ""photos and videos of his genitalia while traveling for UF,"" used social media to make sexual advances and request sexual favors, and stalked women. He is alleged to have taken photos of women, then send the pictures to them, and also of making visits to places where he knew he could find those same women. The Alligator interviewed two women who said they had complained about Golden, and they corroborated the Title IX documents. They said Golden had followed, then unfollowed, numerous women on social media to avoid suspicion, and one of them said his reach to women was vast. He told many women they were ""his drug"" or ""his good luck charm"" before games, she said. ""He just had this manipulation tactic over everyone,"" the woman told The Alligator.

Country Club. Langer, 67, shot his age or better for the third day in a row with his final-round, 5-under-par 66 to get to 18-under 266 for the week at the PGA Tour Champions' season finale. He hadn't won a tournament this season until Sunday, meaning at the last possible minute he extended his streak to 18 straight seasons winning at least one title. Langer also extended his record to 47 wins on the PGA Tour Champions. ""Was that exciting or what?"" Langer said on the Golf Channel broadcast. Alker, 53, won his second Schwab Cup in three seasons on the 50-and-older circuit. He entered the week No. 2 in the points race and passed leader Ernie Els of South Africa by tying for second in the 72-hole finale. Langer hit a poor tee shot and second shot at the 17th hole, leading to a bogey and a three-way tie at 17 under with Alker and Richard Green of Australia. Green was in the clubhouse with a 6-under 65 and preparing for a possible playoff at 17-under 267. He entered the week No. 6 in points and needed to win the tournament to win the Schwab Cup. Langer landed his approach shot at the par-5 18th much further than Alker, but his putt turned from left to right at the last second and dropped for a massive birdie. Langer dropped his putter and tossed his visor in celebration. Langer said his caddie, Terry Holt, had told him, ""It's one more putt."" ""He's a prophet, I guess,"" Langer said. Alker then left his birdie try short, failing to force a playoff. But with Green also coming up short, Alker had the Schwab Cup in the bag. ""It's been a heck of a journey,"" Alker said at the trophy presentation before thanking his team. ""... Obviously, I would have liked to win today, but Bernhard, we're gonna give a hand for Bernhard because he's incredible. He really is."" Alker shot a 66 with six birdies and one bogey, following Saturday's hugely important round of 63. He collected the Schwab Cup despite winning just one tournament this season, the season opener in Hawaii. But he had four runners-up and 15 top-10s entering the week. ""It's a season-long race, right, and so consistency, you want to try to get some wins in there as well,"" Alker said. ""I'm proud of the fact that I kept that consistency over the last few years."" Langer arrived at the course with a one-shot lead over Alker through 54 holes. He birdied his first four in a row and six of his first nine for a 6-under 30 before bogeying Nos. 10 and 11. ""I played good and then got a little unraveled there on the back nine, and Steven Alker got going,"" Langer said. Alker birdied Nos. 14, 15 and 17 to join the late tie with Langer and Green. Germany's Alex Cejka (68) was a distant fourth at 13 under. Australian Rod Pampling also shot 68 and placed fifth at 10 under.

It is the best start through 10 games for Arizona since it opened the 2021 season with seven straight wins.

Madlock made two free throws to trim the lead to nine again, but Sears converted a three-point play for a 12-point lead with two minutes remaining. The game was tightly contested throughout the first half. The Tigers scored the first four points of the game to take as big a lead as they would have in the first half, then the score was tied twice. The lead changed hands seven times before Knox's field goal and Madlock's four free throws helped the Hornets open their biggest lead, 32-25. Bailey's free throw trimmed the margin to six at halftime, but LSU didn't make a field goal during the final 5:34 of the half. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Bohannon, who turns 54 next month, has a career record of 72-38, including 5-6 in the ASUN Conference in 2022, and 3-6 in a transition season as an independent in 2023. The Owls have the losing record this year as a new member of Conference USA, which led to media reports that he was in danger of being fired. The Owls' lone victory came at home Oct. 23 against previously undefeated Liberty, 27-24. Kennesaw State has lost two games since then, including a 43-35 double-overtime loss to UTEP on Saturday in El Paso, Texas. ""Coach Brian Bohannon informed me this morning that he has decided to step down as our head football coach,"" Kennesaw State athletic director Milton Overton said. ""I want to express my sincere appreciation to Coach Bohannon and his family for their dedication to Kennesaw State University and our football program over the past 11 years. ""Coach Bohannon led Kennesaw State into the football era, poured his heart and soul into this program, and represented our university with the highest standards of professionalism and character."" Chandler Burks, the co-offensive coordinator and a former star quarterback for the Owls, will serve as interim head coach for the rest of the season. The Owls have home games on Saturday against Sam Houston and Nov. 23 against FIU before visiting Louisiana Tech in Ruston on Nov. 30. Kennesaw State hired Bohannon in March 2013 to launch an FCS program, which made its debut in 2015 and quickly enjoyed success, going 49-10 from 2017-21. His teams won three Big South Conference titles and made four FCS playoff appearances. He was twice selected the Big South Conference Coach of the Year and was the 2017 FCS national coach of the year by the American Football Coaches Association. A former wide receiver at the University of Georgia (1991-93), Bohannon was an assistant coach at Gardner-Webb (1996), Georgia Southern (1997-2001), Navy (2002-07) and Georgia Tech (2008-12) before he was hired to start the program at Kennesaw State in 2013. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

After passing William Byron by going from fifth to first in one lap following a restart with 54 laps to go, Logano kept his No. 22 Team Penske Ford out front and went on to win by 0.33 seconds over defending champion Blaney, giving owner Roger Penske his third straight title. Logano made it into the championship playoffs after Alex Bowman was disqualified after the Southern 500 at Darlington. He parlayed that into his third title -- also doing it in 2018 and 2022 -- and became the 10th racer all-time to win at least three Cup titles. Byron, Kyle Larson and Christopher Bell completed the top five in the race that featured four cautions. Title contender Tyler Reddick was sixth. Carson Hocevar finished 18th and earned Rookie of the Year honors. Two-time champion Kyle Busch was 21st and failed to win over the 36 races, ending his NASCAR-record streak of 19 consecutive seasons with at least one win. In his final start as a full-time driver, 2017 Cup winner Martin Truex Jr. brought them to green from the pole position at the Arizona desert's 1-mile track, but teammate Ty Gibbs created the first caution when he scrubbed the wall in Turn 4 in his No. 54 then smacked the Turn 2 wall hard on Lap 2 in a single-car incident. Logano powered past Truex on the restart and set the pace in the 312-lap event to close 2024. Soon, all four of the title contenders were running inside the top 10 before the halfway point of 60-lap Stage 1, which Logano won after leading 54 laps. However, Logano's pit crew had difficulties on the right side during the pit stop, gridding him fifth when the group led by Chase Elliott left pit road with Byron and Blaney running in third and fourth. In the race's oddest moment as the field was about to restart, the Toyota pace car turned late onto pit road and made hard contact with the sand-filled yellow barrels abutting the beginning of the pit road outer wall. That wreck created a red-flag period. A week after being penalized for wall-riding on the final turns at Martinsville and eliminated from title contention, Bell had the look of a champion on the rare Champ 4 weekend when Joe Gibbs Racing did not have an entry among the quartet of Cup seekers. A day after saying he felt wronged by NASCAR and ""cheated"" out of a title chance, Bell had a strong No. 20 JGR Toyota for most of Stage 2. However, Blaney showed his strength by moving past Bell in the final laps as Penske Fords pulled off the segment sweep in the first 185 circuits around the slightly banked layout. With Bell leading following Stage 2's conclusion, Blaney, Byron and Logano occupied the next three spots, while Reddick slotted ninth with 117 laps left. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Its lone win came against Cal on Sept. 21. The Seminoles have dropped six straight games since that victory. Last season, Florida State went 13-1 and barely missed a College Football Playoff spot in the four-team system. The Seminoles lost 63-3 to Georgia in the Orange Bowl.

A third-year pro out of Oklahoma State, Eckroat joined the tour in 2023 and previously won at the Cognizant Classic in The Palm Beaches in March. Eckroat began the day a stroke behind leaders Justin Lower, Carson Young and Colombia's Nico Echavarria while he was also tied with two other players, Max Greyserman and Joe Highsmith.  That group, with the exception of Echavarria, was tightly aligned through nine holes Sunday, but Eckroat caught fire to begin the back nine of El Cardonal at Diamante, creating some needed separation with four birdies across the first five holes (Nos. 10-12, 14). That hot stretch, paired with his six birdies over his first eight holes, was ultimately necessary, as Eckroat fired his second bogey of the day on the par-5 18th, putting him at 24-under 264 for the tournament. That opened the door ever so slightly for Young (7-under 65), who could have forced a playoff with an eagle on 18. But Young, who carded seven other birdies on the day, settled for another to finish 23 under for the tourney, giving Eckroat a one-stroke victory. Lower (65), who was three strokes back after 17 holes, made up two of them with an eagle on 18 to finish in a tie for second with Young. Eckroat finished with 11 birdies against two bogeys to complete his remarkable day. Greyserman, meanwhile, was steady throughout but could never quite get into position to apply pressure. His eight-birdie, one-bogey day left him at 7 under for the round and 22 under for the tournament. Highsmith finished in fifth place at 19 under with his 4-under 68 final round, while Echavarria landed in a six-way tie for sixth place at 17 under after his 1-under 71. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Tierna Davidson broke the scoreless draw to give Gotham a 1-0 lead in the 67th minute off a set piece. Lavelle served the ball into the center of the box and it landed by Davidson, who was amid a crowd of Thorns but got her foot on the ball to send a shot past the arm of goalkeeper Shelby Hogan. It was Davidson's first NWSL goal since 2019, then with the Chicago Red Stars. The Thorns capitalized on a free kick of their own to pull level in the 75th minute. Olivia Moultrie served a cross from the left, and Reilyn Turner jumped for header on the far side, directing just inside the right post. Gotham controlled much of the play in the first half, working more time in the attacking third while managing four shot attempts, one on target. Portland had only one shot attempt, not on target, in the opening 45 minutes. Gotham goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger nearly served up a golden opportunity for Christine Sinclair in the 40th minute when her attempt at midfield hit the star Canadian forward before Gotham recovered the ball in the defensive third.

Avery, Suemnick and Thompson were the only Oklahoma State players to score more than eight points. Suemnick shot 5-of-6 from the field. Arturo Dean led Oklahoma State with nine rebounds and five assists. St. Thomas' leading scorer Miles Barnstable was held to just six points in the contest and didn't make his first field goal until there was 6:49 remaining. St. Thomas was led in scoring by Kendall Blue with 18 points, followed by Drake Dobbs, who had 14. St. Thomas went up 6-2 in the first three minutes of the game but went scoreless over the next 5:19, allowing Oklahoma State to take a 12-6 lead with 12:28 remaining in the first half. Oklahoma State made it a 17-2 run to take a 19-8 lead just past the 10-minute mark. St. Thomas subsequently answered with a 10-0 run of its own that brought the Tommies back within a point. They started their rally by making three consecutive field goals, including back-to-back 3-pointers by Carter Bjerke, while forcing the Cowboys to miss eight straight shots from the field during that stretch. The Cowboys answered with a 9-0 run that saw St. Thomas go into another lengthy scoring drought over a span of 3:50, falling behind by double digits again until a technical foul by Suemnick sent the Tommies to the line to cut the lead to 28-20. The Tommies couldn't keep the deficit to single digits before the break and went to halftime trailing 33-23. Oklahoma State shot 27-of-60 (45 percent) from the field, including 6-of-22 (27.3 percent) from 3-point range. St. Thomas outshot Oklahoma State from behind the arc, making 15 triples on 36 attempts (41.7 percent) but went just 25-of-62 (40.3 percent) from the field overall. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

They're also aware that a torrid start quickly has transformed their profile. ""We know how hard it is to win in this league,"" the Cavaliers' Darius Garland said. ""And now, 11 in a row, 11-0. We're the hunted. We're not the hunters no more."" Cleveland earned its most recent victory behind a furious comeback. Hosting the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday, the Cavaliers sputtered after halftime, scoring only 13 points in the third quarter. Behind a double-double from Evan Mobley (23 points, 16 rebounds) and big scoring efforts from Donovan Mitchell (22 points) and Garland (20), Cleveland steadied things. An 82-68 deficit with 1:03 left in the third became a 105-100 victory. ""Normally, this is 11 games in, you're not thinking about a streak,"" Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""But tonight, you're like, man, 'I don't want it to end that this way.' ... We're trying to win every game, but it's kind of weirdly in the back of your mind when you're out there competing, like, 'man, we got to keep this thing going.' "" Chicago is aiming to win consecutive games for the second time this season. The Bulls stopped a four-game slide with Saturday's 125-113 win in Atlanta, relying on a big fourth quarter of their own. Chicago outscored Atlanta 35-15 in the final period, benefiting from a balanced attack that produced eight scorers in double figures. Ayo Dosunmu led the way with 19 points, Nikola Vucevic posted a double-double of 18 points and 12 boards, and Zach LaVine and Coby White added 18 points apiece. LaVine returned after missing the past three games with a right adductor strain. ""It's always good to get guys back in the lineup,"" he said. Opponents have outscored the Bulls in the first quarter nine times in 10 games to begin the season. Improved pace and ball movement have been catalysts for helping the team regroup; the Bulls have recorded at least 30 assists five times. ""We just wanted to find a way to get back in the winner's column,"" Chicago guard Josh Giddey said. ""I thought we started the game not great, and that third quarter really got us back in it and that group starting the fourth did an awesome job; the energy was great. I think it was a complete team effort tonight and that's what we needed against a group like this."" Challenging the Cavaliers, the 12th team in NBA history to start a season 11-0, will require sustained sharpness. Cleveland knows that well from the other side, with Saturday's frantic finish continuing the good vibes. ""Defensively, we locked in, got stops, got rebounds, boxed out, didn't miss opportunities,"" Mitchell said. ""We did all the little things, and I think that's what you saw tonight, just the effort as a whole. And that's what made this one special."" Cleveland has won seven of the past eight meetings against Chicago, but the Bulls lead the all-time series 133-101. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

It was the first catch as a Steeler for Williams, who was acquired Tuesday in a trade with the New York Jets, and came on third-and-9 play after the Steelers had fumbled at Washington's 1-yard line on their previous drive. After Chris Boswell's extra point, Washington (7-3) drove to midfield, but Jayden Daniels' pass to tight end Zach Ertz came up a yard short on fourth-and-9. The Commanders would have gotten the ball back, but Russell Wilson drew an offside penalty on fourth-and-1 at the Washington 49 with 1:02 remaining. Wilson was 14-of-28 for 195 yards, three touchdowns and one interception for the Steelers (7-2). George Pickens caught five passes for 91 yards and a score. Daniels finished 17-of-34 for 202 yards. Terry McLaurin had five catches for 113 yards and Austin Ekeler had two rushing scores. Early in the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh drove inside the 10. On second down at the 8, Jaylen Warren bulled his way to the 1, but as several Washington players struggled to bring him down the ball came out. Jeremy Chinn recovered for the Commanders. Pittsburgh took the early 7-0 lead when Wilson hit Pickens, who made a twisting, diving catch in the end zone for a 16-yard touchdown. Special teams factored heavily into the next two scores. On fourth-and-15 from deep in their own territory, the Steelers faked the punt, but James Pierre dropped the wide-open pass from Miles Killebrew. Washington took over at the 15, and three plays later Ekeler scored from the 1. Early in the second quarter, Washington's Olamide Zaccheaus muffed a punt. The Steelers started again at the 14 and Wilson hit Pat Freiermuth for a 3-yard touchdown. Trailing 14-10, the Commanders took over on their own 6-yard line with 5:39 in the half. On third-and-4 from the Pittsburgh 38, Daniels hit Luke McCaffrey for 23 yards and Ekeler later scored on another 1-yard run to send the Commanders to the locker room ahead 17-14. Washington got the second-half kick and on the first play, Daniels hit McLaurin for 54 yards to the Pittsburgh 17. Three plays later, the pair connected for 16 yards. Jeremy McNichols punched it in and the lead was 24-14. On the next drive, Wilson hit Pickens for a 34-yard catch-and-run to the Commanders 12, and Najee Harris scored from the 1 to pull the Steelers within 24-21. Zane Gonzalez, filling in for the injured Austin Seibert, hit from 41 yards out to make it 27-21 Commanders late in the third quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Moody had earlier missed field goals of 49, 50 and 44, with the final one of the bunch coming with 3:09 remaining. Moody's third miss led to Chase McLaughlin's 26-yard field goal for the Buccaneers to tie the game 20-20 with 41 seconds remaining. The Bucs drove to the 49ers' 8-yard line to set up for the game-tying kick with the help of three penalties and a circus 8-yard completion by Baker Mayfield, who escaped pressure and fended off defensive end Nick Bosa long enough to get off a throw. Purdy's 13-yard pass to Jauan Jennings set up San Francisco's game-winning field goal from Moody. Jenings had seven receptions for 93 yards. 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan worked McCaffrey back into the offense mix immediately after missing the first eight games of the season with bilateral Achilles tendinitis. His presence also freed up opportunities for wide receivers Deebo Samuel and Jennings - both of whom had been dealing with injuries - and tight end George Kittle.  McCaffrey, the 2023 Offensive Player of the Year, finished with 39 yards rushing on 13 carries and 68 receiving yards on six catches for San Francisco (5-4). Purdy finished 25-for-36 for 353 yards with touchdown passes to rookie Ricky Pearsall and Kittle. Pearsall's 46-yard TD reception in the first quarter, that gave the 49ers a 7-0 lead, was the first score of the rookie's career and came after he was shot in the chest in a robbery attempt in August. He finished with four receptions for 73 yards. Tampa Bay (4-6) lost All-Pro left tackle Tristen Wirfs to a knee injury in the first half. Rachaad White's 9-yard touchdown reception from Mayfield tied the game 10-10 just 55 seconds into the second half as Tampa Bay exploited a muffed punt by Jacob Cowing at the San Francisco 21. Kittle's 11-yard TD catch came after Purdy extended the play gave San Francisco a 20-17 lead with 7:02 left. The eight-play, 52-yard drive was helped by an over-the-shoulder catch by McCaffrey that went for 30 yards. Tampa Bay took its first lead of the game 17-13 with 14:18 left against a defense withering in 90-degree heat. Running back Bucky Irving sliced in from 12 yards to cap a 12-play, 70-yard drive.

The Vikings' defense had three takeaways in the fourth quarter to seal the victory. Mac Jones scored on a 1-yard run to mark the only scoring for Jacksonville (2-8). Jones completed 14 of 22 passes for 111 yards and two interceptions as a replacement starter for Trevor Lawrence, who missed the game because of a shoulder injury. Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold completed 24 of 38 passes for 241 yards but threw three interceptions. Minnesota running back Aaron Jones finished with 101 total yards (88 rushing, 13 receiving). Romo put the Vikings on top 9-7 with 7:14 remaining in the fourth quarter. His 34-yard field goal sneaked inside the right upright for the go-ahead score. On the next possession, the Jaguars committed their first turnover on a botched snap. Jones could not handle the ball, and Vikings defensive lineman Harrison Phillips pounced on the fumble at the Jacksonville 25-yard line. Five plays later, the Vikings settled for another field goal to take a 12-7 lead. Romo connected from 29 yards for his fourth field goal. Jones followed with another turnover on the next drive. He underthrew a pass toward receiver Gabe Davis, and Byron Murphy Jr. stepped in front of it for an interception. The play marked Murphy's fourth interception of the season and his third in the past three games. Jacksonville's final drive ended in a third consecutive turnover. Camryn Bynum intercepted a deep pass at the Vikings' 1-yard line with 1:52 remaining. The Vikings opened the scoring midway through the first quarter.

It's the recent off-court concerns with Title IX allegations against coach Todd Golden that have dominated the news. In a home battle with Grambling on Monday in Gainesville, Fla., the Gators will try to keep the focus on a promising hoops season. The Gators (2-0) come in off a 98-83 win over South Florida and an 81-60 victory over Jacksonville in the first week of the season. After 24 wins and an NCAA Tournament berth in Golden's second season, Florida is well-positioned to continue an upward trend. The Gators have been led by a powerful scoring quartet who have accounted for over 77 percent of the Florida offense. Senior guards Walter Clayton and Will Richard have averaged 19 and 18 points per game, respectively, while Aussie sophomore Alex Condon (18 ppg) and junior guard Alijah Martin (14 ppg) complete the high-scoring group. Florida has connected on 72.9 percent of its 2-point attempts through two games, which is among the nation's leaders. The Gators' biggest early weakness has been the glass, where they have a net-zero rebounding margin. Despite two early wins, Golden has room for concern with the Gators. ""Fundamentally, we're not great right now,"" he said after Florida's win over Jacksonville. ""Part of it is a combination of being too amped up and trying to run in and trace down the ball, as opposed to hitting bodies."" Golden later reiterated, ""We did not rebound well enough if we want to be the team we're capable of."" Meanwhile, Grambling (1-1) is led by veteran coach Donte Jackson and presents a legitimate challenge. Jackson led the Tigers to 21 wins and the school's first NCAA Tournament berth last season.  This year, Grambling topped NAIA-level opponent Southern-New Orleans 92-42, then dropped a close battle with No. 24 Ole Miss, 66-64. The Tigers led by eight points at halftime in that game but were eventually done in by 22 turnovers. Four Tigers are currently scoring in double figures, led by Kintavious Dozier at 15.0 ppg. Dozier earned all-SWAC honors last season. Among the other top Tigers are Mikale Stevenson (13.5 ppg), NC State transfer Ernest Ross (12.5 ppg) and Antwan Burnett (12.0 ppg, 8.5 rebounds per game). The Tigers, unlike their hosts, have been excellent on the boards, outrebounding opponents by 10.5 rebounds per game, including a plus-six margin at Ole Miss. On the downside, they are one of the worst free-throw shooting teams in the nation at just 59.4 percent. Ole Miss coach Chris Beard spoke at length in praise of Grambling after his hard-fought win. ""We didn't play our best, but the reason we didn't play our best was a lot on the other team -- Grambling,"" Beard said. He later clarified, ""They had our full attention. This isn't going to be one of those deals where Ole Miss didn't play well. That's an NCAA Tournament team. That's where we're trying to get."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

In the 96th minute, a Spirit cross in front of the Bay FC goal bounced off the shoulder of defender Caprice Dydasco and landed in the back of the net. It proved to be the difference in a defensive battle that needed extra time to decide. The second-seeded Spirit will advance to the semifinals and host the winner of Gotham FC and the Portland Thorns, while the inaugural season for expansion side Bay FC ended in disappointment for the No. 7 seed. Neither side netted a goal until deep into the second half, as the Spirit's Aubrey Kingsbury and Bay FC's Katelyn Rowland put forth some of their best goalkeeping efforts of the season. Kingsbury had a highlight-worthy stop in the 35th minute, leaping into the air to punch an attempt over the bar. Rowland denied Trinity Rodman a goal in the 24th minute. In the 82nd minute, Asisat Oshoala finally broke the scoreless draw, knocking in a right-footed shot from very close range to put Bay FC ahead 1-0 with minutes remaining. The ball came to her Penelope Hocking, who corralled a delivery from the corner and sent it to Oshoala to tap in her eighth goal of the season. The Spirit countered, scoring in the 86th minute. After a cross from Rodman was knocked out of the box, Tara McKeown charged up the middle of the field, took possession of the ball and fired a right-footed shot that took a few bounces before dribbling past Rowland into the left corner of the net. Nothing was produced between the two sides in nine minutes of stoppage time to send the elimination game into extra time.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Vanderbilt won despite shooting 12.0 percent on 25 attempts from 3-point range but had just nine turnovers and won the rebounding battle 53-32, while making 78.0 percent of its 41 free throws.  McGlockton, a transfer from Boston College, recorded his second double-double in as many games.  BJ Ward scored 22 points, Teddy Washington Jr. had 19 and TJ Biel added 12 for the Redhawks (0-2), who hit 48.0 percent of their 25 shots from 3-point range. Southeast Missouri State went 8 of 13 (61.5 percent) from the free-throw line.  It was the Redhawks' 36th-straight loss against a power-conference team.  The game was the Vanderbilt debut for Hoggard, who returned from an NCAA suspension in his first game after transferring from Michigan State. Nickel canned his second 3-pointer of the second half with 16:10 left, giving the Commodores their first double-figure lead at 56-45.  Southeast Missouri State continued to hit wide-open 3s, with Washington making one with 8:00 left, that cut the margin to 70-65. But the fouls began to pile up on the Redhawks. Washington picked up his fourth as part of a double-technical with Hoggard, while starter Troy Cole Jr. fouled out with 3:57 left. Ward checked out with 6:06 left with the training staff attending to the area around his knee before checking back in with 3:35 left and the Redhawks trailing 78-70. They never got closer from there.  Ward had 14 points at half, as the Redhawks made seven 3-pointers compared to one on 13 attempts for Vanderbilt. But Vanderbilt had a 40-38 edge at half thanks to 14 offensive rebounds and a 15 of 22 showing from the foul line.  The Redhawks led 16-6 early but Hoggard, who checked in at the 16:25 mark of the first half, keyed a 17-4 run that gave Vanderbilt its first lead.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Ospreys (3-0), who defeated SEC member South Carolina in the season opener, earned their first win over an Atlantic Coast Conference opponent. They became the first opponent to score 100 against Georgia Tech at McCamish Pavilion since Duke in 2017. Harris was 8-for-10 from the floor with seven rebounds.

But North Florida was 8-for-9 at the line, while Georgia Tech was just 1-for-6, allowing the Ospreys to hold a 53-49 halftime lead. North Florida continued its hot shooting to start the second half. The Ospreys outscored the Yellow Jackets 11-0 to take a 66-56 lead at 16:27 and never slowed down. UNF built the lead to 20 when Lliteras drove the lane for a slam, drew a foul and finished the three-point play to complete a 14-0 run that made it it 80-60 with 11:08 left.

Sallis sank two free throws with 4.7 seconds left as the Demon Deacons (3-0) went up by three and completed a rally from a 13-point first-half hole. Rubin Jones made a final foul shot for Michigan and intentionally missed the next attempt, but the Wolverines couldn't secure the rebound for a final shot. Freshman Juke Harris scored 11 points off the bench in Wake Forest's first game away from home. Roddy Gayle Jr. led Michigan (1-1) with 11 points, Tre Donaldson had 10 points and nine rebounds and L.J. Cason also scored 10. Sam Walters (nine points), Nimari Burnett (nine), Jones (nine) and Vladislav Goldin (eight) were contributors. Spillers' 3-pointer gave Wake Forest its first lead at 44-43 with 15:56 to play, but there was a back-and-forth stretch after that. Michigan led 57-53 before failing to score for more than five minutes. Sallis posted six points during a 10-0 Demon Deacons run. Leading 65-63, Wake Forest benefited from a Michigan airball as the shot clock expired. The action stayed at the other end for 90 seconds as the Demon Deacons collected a pair of offensive rebounds before a turnover. On the final of Michigan's three straight turnovers, Spillers scored on a breakaway dunk for a 67-63 edge with 38 seconds left. Gayle hit a pair of free throws for Michigan at the 30.3-second mark. Michigan shot 14-for-28 from the field in the first half but 10-for-29 in the second half.

The Scarlet Knights (1-0) started the season with a 75-52 victory Wednesday over Wagner despite the absence of Ace Bailey, the nation's No. 2 overall recruit in 2024. Bailey, a 6-foot-10 guard/forward, is listed as day-to-day after suffering an unspecified injury during practice last week. ""Every year is exciting in its own way, but every year is challenging in its own way too,"" Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell said. ""So quick reminder with Ace, the challenges that come with your season and having guys ready, and early in the season, is always a challenge."" Another five-star recruit, guard Dylan Harper, led host Rutgers with 20 points and added four assists Wednesday, playing 32 minutes in the 23-point victory. ""It was a dream come true, to be honest,"" Harper said. ""Getting a chance to play in front of this crowd, in front of the Riot Squad, it's just crazy. Honestly, a blessing."" Freshman Lathan Sommerville had 11 points and eight rebounds in his first collegiate game. PJ Hayes IV scored 12 points and Jeremiah Williams added 10. Despite the lopsided win, Pikiell is looking for improvement in his team in Game 2. ""We gotta rebound better, we gotta do a lot of things, but we've got a lot more players to decide from,"" he said. Wagner outrebounded Rutgers 42-39, but the Scarlet Knights' defense helped them overcome the deficiency on the boards and come away with the victory. Rutgers held Wagner to 34.9 percent shooting from the field and forced 11 turnovers, scoring 16 points off those mistakes. Now, the Scarlet Knights will face Saint Peter's (0-2), which is working in eight new players under coach Bashir Mason. ""Toughness,"" Mason said about the Peacocks' style of basketball. ""We practice it every day. Just being able to withstand adverse conditions, rough handlings, staying together and staying connected. Figuring out ways to win."" Although Saint Peter's is winless, both losses have come by seven points or fewer after second-half comeback efforts. On Friday, the Peacocks traveled to UMass Lowell and fell 81-74. Saint Peter's trailed by nine at halftime and by 15 early in the second half before drawing within four points five times down the stretch. Marcus Randolph led Saint Peter's with 16 points, and Stephon Roberts was two points shy of a double-double with eight points and 11 rebounds. The Peacocks started the season with a 57-53 loss at Seton Hall on Monday. Saint Peter's will play eight of its first nine games on the road this year. Last season, the Peacocks traveled to Rutgers, too, losing 71-40 on Nov. 27. Saint Peter's recovered at the end of the season to win the MAAC Tournament title and gain its second NCAA Tournament berth in the three seasons. In 2022, the Peacocks won three tournament games before falling to North Carolina in the Elite Eight. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Kam Jones, who dropped 32 points in a season-opening win over Stony Brook, was the driving force behind the offense again. He scored 24 points on 9-of-14 shooting and dished eight assists to go with five rebounds and three steals.  ""I'm just out there with a mentality of making the right play, whatever that means,"" Jones said, per the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""If that means me scoring, fine. If that means me passing. If that means I'm in the corner with the correct spacing. Whatever it is, that's what I'm trying to do every possession on both ends."" Chase Ross also made key contributions, including scoring seven of his 11 points in the second half. He added five rebounds, four assists and a career-high five steals. Marquette has 23 steals through two games and has scored 46 points off opponents' turnovers. Central Michigan (1-1) hosted Stony Brook on Thursday and squandered a 12-point lead en route to a 73-72 loss. Bryan Ndjonga missed two free throws after being intentionally fouled, and the Chippewas yielded a game-winning layup to Collin O'Connor with three seconds left. Jakobi Heady leads Central Michigan with a 14.5 scoring average through two games. Damarion Bonds, a junior college transfer, made his team debut against Stony Brook and scored 10 points in 10 minutes off the bench, including back-to-back 3-pointers during the first half. ""He has the chance to be an electric scorer, and we got a small glimpse of what he has the ability to do,"" coach Tony Barbee told the Central Michigan student newspaper.

It's likely McNeese State worked through some of those issues as it rebounded with a 111-57 win over the College Of Biblical Studies, who play in the National Christian Collegiate Athletic Association. Guard Javohn Garcia is averaging 18 points for the Cowboys on 60.9 percent shooting from the field. Providence transfer Alyn Breed scored 18 points in the season opener but missed their second game for precautionary reasons. He is expected to play against Alabama. ""His knee had some swelling after our practices (Wednesday),"" Wade said Thursday. ""We had a couple practices (Wednesday), one in the afternoon and one at night, and he had a little swelling after that, so we decided not to risk it. He could have played today, but we got to be smart about that."" The Crimson Tide (2-0) entered the season ranked second in the Associated Press Top 25. They backed up their ranking with a resounding 56-point win over UNC Asheville in the season opener before beating Arkansas State 88-79 in a much tighter affair in their second game.  Mark Sears, the Southeastern Conference preseason player of the year, has been leading the charge for Alabama over the first two games with an average of 19.5 points per game. Guard Labaron Philon leads the team with an average of 6 assists per game in addition to 11 points per game. Philon was one assist shy of a double-double in his collegiate debut. ""He's a great two-way player,"" Alabama coach Nate Oats said about Philon, a freshman. ""He plays really hard on both sides of the ball. ... He's got size and athleticism and he's been playing the right way, really, since he stepped on campus."" Big man Clifford Omoruyi also has been a difference maker for the Crimson Tide. The 6-foot-11 center from Nigeria is averaging 14 points per game and 8.5 rebounds while shooting 91.7 percent (11-for-12) from the field. Only four players with at least 10 field goal attempts on the young season have a better field goal percentage than Omoruyi. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The No. 14 Boilermakers (2-0) look to please their leader when they battle Yale (1-1) on Monday night in nonconference play at West Lafayette, Ind. A showdown with No. 2 Alabama looms on Friday for the program that lost to UConn in last season's national championship game. Also, the contest against the Bulldogs definitely rates tougher than opening foes Texas A&M-Corpus Christi and Northern Kentucky. Yale was one of the darlings of March Madness last season. The 13th-seeded Bulldogs of the Ivy League stunned fourth-seeded Auburn 78-76 in the first round before getting stomped by San Diego State in the second round. So Painter wants a larger effort in Game No. 3 of the season. ""He kind of ripped us a little bit, but it's simple stuff,"" Boilermakers guard Fletcher Loyer said in the postgame press conference following Friday's 72-50 home win over Northern Kentucky. ""It's just talking to each other. We talk off the floor so we can talk on the floor. And he always says, 'If you're doing it, you're saying it.' ""Just making sure we're all being positive with each other, make or missed shots. Just keep talking to each other, and ultimately that leads to success."" Loyer certainly isn't the cause of any dismay as he leads the Boilermakers with an 18.5 scoring average and has knocked down 7 of 10 3-pointers. Trey Kaufman-Renn is averaging 14.5 points and a team-best 7.0 rebounds while top-notch point guard Braden Smith is averaging 11.5 points and a team-high 11.0 assists per game. Starting center Daniel Jacobsen unlikely will be available after sustaining a knee injury one minute into the game against Northern Kentucky on Friday. Painter said Jacobson would undergo an MRI exam Saturday. Will Berg is the likely starter against Yale. The Bulldogs split their first two games, beating Quinnipiac to open the season before losing 91-79 to Illinois-Chicago on Friday. March Madness hero John Poulakidas scored 21 points against UIC and is averaging 20.0 over the first two games. Poulakidas scored 28 points in the mammoth upset of Auburn. He made 10 of 15 shots, including 6 of 9 from 3-point range. Yale coach James Jones is in his 24th season at the school. That upset was his second NCAA Tournament victory. Jones is worried about whether last March could be the Ivy League's last hurrah as recent changes like NIL and the transfer portal work against the education-minded schools in his conference. ""I don't know how feasible it is to continue the success we have nationally in the league, given the new structure of things, where everybody is being paid except for our guys,"" Jones told reporters earlier this month. ""I don't know if we can sustain. Five years from now, is an Ivy League team going to be able to go to the NCAA Tournament and beat an Auburn team? I don't know. ""From that standpoint, it makes it hard. We're 40 minutes away from a Sweet 16 last year and we've gotten (to the second round) twice. I don't know. Different world. Absolutely different world. It's changed, and I don't know if it's changed for the better."" Yale is 0-2 against Purdue and the most recent matchup came in the 2022 NCAA Tournament. The Boilermakers prevailed 78-56. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The group's mentality is to always find areas to improve, and that will be the case as Iowa State (1-0) tips off against Kansas City (2-0) on Monday night in Ames, Iowa. ""Yeah, we have to do a better job of playing simple basketball,"" Otzelberger said. ""I think, offensively, there are times the ball got stuck with one guy and we over-dribbled it,"" he said. ""There are plays on the defensive end that we didn't finish with two hands. We (would get) a rebound, we dribble it off of someone's foot or we have a careless turnover. Things that were just sloppy that are uncharacteristic of how we play."" Despite those imperfections, Iowa State cruised to an 83-44 win over Mississippi Valley State in its opener last Monday. Keshon Gilbert scored 17 points, Tamin Lipsey contributed 16, and Joshua Jefferson and Milan Momcilovic added 10 apiece to lead the Cyclones, who shot only 23.8 percent (5 of 21) from beyond the arc.  That's an area Otzelberger will look to improve upon against Kansas City. ""I thought we had good looks,"" he said. ""Curt (Jones) and Milan, specifically, had really good looks. Overall, we want to shoot the ball better than we did. But I didn't think it was because we didn't have good looks. It was because they weren't falling for whatever reason."" Kansas City will aim to challenge the Cyclones after opening its season with back-to-back, double-digit victories. The Roos cruised to a 124-36 win over Kansas Christian in their most recent game Friday night. The 88-point margin of victory against the NCCAA Division II program is the biggest in program history for Kansas City. The previous record was a 73-point win over Bacone (111-38) on Nov. 18, 2019. ""I felt like we put ourselves in position early to just execute and not have to worry about winning the game, so to speak,"" Roos coach Marvin Menzies said. ""That's something we didn't do in our last game (91-68 win over Hannibal-LaGrange last Monday), so I felt like we took a step in the right direction."" Anderson Kopp scored 22 points to lead Kansas City on Friday. He added five rebounds and three steals. Kasheem Grady II also will look to stay hot for the Roos. He scored 21 points on 7-of-11 shooting from the field, including 5 of 7 from beyond the arc, against Kansas Christian. Menzies said his team needs to be focused for a tough test at Iowa State. ""The train is out of the station now,"" he said. ""So it's rolling. We'll put this game behind us and put all our focus into the next possession."" Menzies and Otzelberger share a connection: Both men were head coaches at UNLV. Menzies spent three seasons there (2016-19) and was immediately succeeded by Otzelberger (2019-21). Monday will mark the sixth meeting between Iowa State and Kansas City. The Cyclones are 5-0 in the series. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Panthers (3-7) got the ball at the New York 23 for its only possession of overtime. Bryce Young completed 15 of 25 passes for 126 yards with a touchdown and Chuba Hubbard churned out a career-high 153 yards on the ground on 28 carries. Giants quarterback Daniel Jones went 22-for-37 for 190 yards with two interceptions. He ran for a touchdown.  Running back Tyrone Tracy Jr. gained 103 yards on 18 carries with a touchdown, but his fumble on the first snap of overtime set up Carolina's winning points. Graham Gano's 42-yard field goal with five seconds to play forced overtime for the Giants (2-8), who've lost five straight games.  With the score at 17-14, the teams traded turnovers in the final eight minutes. The Panthers lost a fumble, only to have Jones throw an interception four plays later. New York got the ball back at its own 21-yard line with 2:23 remaining and drove for the tying field goal.  The Giants opened the second half by going 65 yards in 10 plays while consuming more than six minutes off the clock. Tracy ran 32 yards for the touchdown. Carolina responded by marching 80 yards in 10 plays with Hubbard scoring on a 1-yard run. Then in the fourth quarter, the Giants covered 96 yards in 13 plays and used almost seven minutes in doing so. Jones capped the drive by running 2 yards for a score as New York closed within 17-14. Aside from one drive, there wasn't much offense in the first half. The Panthers scored first by going 90 yards in eight plays, with Young connecting with tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders for a 5-yard touchdown play. Carolina added to its lead on the next possession, using 10 plays to go 56 yards to set up Pineiro's 53-yard field goal. Trailing 10-0, the Giants threatened in the second quarter, but Gano -- a former Carolina kicker in his first game back after an injury -- sailed a 43-yard field goal attempt wide right. New York reached Carolina territory again before halftime, getting all the way to the 18-yard line before Xavier Woods intercepted Jones on the first play after the two-minute warning.

NFL Network reported that rest and rehab appear to be the plan of the Jaguars (2-7) for Lawrence. However, surgery remains an option Lawrence and the Jaguars will consider. Mac Jones, who was acquired by Jacksonville via trade in March, will start Sunday's game versus the Vikings (6-2).  Lawrence, 25, will miss the second game of his NFL career. He sustained the injury in the second quarter of Jacksonville's 28-23 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles last Sunday. He finished the game, however, and completed 16 of 31 passes for 169 yards and two interceptions. Jones became party to a controversy when current Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores was fired by the Dolphins. According to former NFL executive Michael Lombardi, Flores told his then-starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa that Miami should've drafted Jones instead. As the starting quarterback of the Patriots, Jones lost to Flores and the Dolphins twice in 2021. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, Lawrence has completed 61.3 percent of his passes for 2,004 yards, 11 touchdowns and six interceptions through nine starts in 2024.

The Sabres followed impressive blowout wins over the Ottawa Senators and the New York Rangers with a 3-2 shootout victory over the Calgary Flames on Saturday. J.J. Peterka scored the game-winning shootout goal, while Tage Thompson fired home his team-leading 10th goal of the season in the victory. Thompson has goals in three straight games and could improve his totals versus a Canadiens' team that he has found success against in his career. The 27-year-old forward has seven goals and seven assists across 12 outings against Montreal. Sabres goaltender Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen has been pivotal to their recent success. Luukkonen has allowed just 2.25 goals per game while winning six of his past eight starts. Head coach Lindy Ruff gave praise to his Finnish netminder following Saturday's shootout victory.  ""He's played very well, the team play has been better and his play has been better,"" Ruff said. ""He's really made key saves. You look at that overtime save he made for us, that allowed us to get the extra point."" Another key to the Sabres' recent success has been their special teams play. After failing to score on their first 22 power-play opportunities to start the season, Buffalo is 7 for 23 on the man advantage over their past seven games. A win on Monday would give the Sabres their first four-game winning streak in 21 months. At the other end of the spectrum, the Canadiens fell to the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-1 on Saturday night, en route to their sixth consecutive loss (0-5-1). One bright spot for the Canadiens has been the play of veteran winger Brendan Gallagher. The 32-year-old scored the Canadiens' lone goal on Saturday, giving him seven on the season, and extended his goal-scoring streak to three games. The 2010 fifth-round pick now ranks 19th all-time in the Canadiens' goal-scoring ranks with 225 career tallies. Canadiens' top scorers Cole Caufield and captain Nick Suzuki have both been held off the scoresheet in each of the past four contests. ""Some of us, myself included, are struggling to produce and find the back of the net,"" Suzuki told reporters after his team's most recent loss. ""I expect better from myself, I'm sure the other guys (do) as well. We need our whole lineup to produce."" Along with their lack of goal scoring, the Canadiens have struggled to keep the puck out of their net. They have allowed 29 goals over the past six losses and scored just 12. The Canadiens recent string of losses seems to be taking a toll on the young squad.  ""It's not great right now. But we're still trying to be positive right now,"" forward Josh Anderson said of the team's feelings. ""Trying to still find our swagger and do the right things. Once we find one, we'll be fine."" The Canadiens enter the matchup in last place in the Eastern Conference and have lost the past two games against the Sabres. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Harlan blasted the officiating late Saturday after the Utes lost to rival BYU, 22-21, on Utah's home field. ""This game was absolutely stolen from us,"" Harlan said. ""We were excited about being in the Big 12, but tonight I am not. We won this game. Someone else stole it from us. Very disappointed."" The Utes, accustomed to being in the mix atop the Pac-12 standings, are struggling in their first year in the Big 12 at 4-5 overall, 1-5 in the conference. Utah clung to a 21-19 led for most of the fourth quarter after a BYU touchdown at the 12:35 mark of the final frame. And twice late in the quarter, the Utes looked as if they were headed to the win. While Harlan didn't specify a call that riled him in particular, it likely occurred in the final two minutes. With 1:56 left, BYU took possession on its 9-yard line, and quarterback Jake Retzlaff fired three straight incomplete passes. The Cougars called a timeout, and on the ensuing fourth-and-10 play, Retzlaff was sacked for a loss that put the ball on the BYU 1-yard-line with about 90 seconds to go. But a holding penalty called on Utah cornerback Zemaiah Vaughn gave BYU new life and the ball at its 19. Retzlaff took advantage, completing passes of 30 yards and 12 yards, and running back Hinckley Ropati's 14-yard run took the ball to the Utah 25 with 1:07 on the clock. A false start penalty on BYU sent the ball back to the Utah 30, and the Cougars spent the next three plays positioning the ball and running down the clock to give Will Ferrin a 44-yard field-goal attempt. which he hit with just three seconds left. ""I will talk to the commissioner. This was not fair to our team,"" Harlan said. ""I'm disgusted by the professionalism of the officiating crew tonight."" Utah coach Kyle Whittingham was angry with officials on the field but let his boss address the officiating postgame. ""Couldn't get that last stop when we needed it, unfortunately,"" Whittingham said. ""That's kind of been the story for several games."" BYU coach Kalani Sitake said refereeing comes with the territory. ""Whatever decision the refs make, I don't think they're trying to get it wrong, so that's just part of the game,"" BYU coach Kalani Sitake said. ""The refs are part of the game. We were able to capitalize on that."" With the win, which came before the largest crowd (54,383) ever at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, No. 9 BYU moved to 9-0, 6-0 in the conference, to stay firmly in the mix for a College Football Playoff berth.

Miami’s fall from the fast-thinning ranks of the unbeaten felt like it had been coming for a while. The Hurricanes needed furious rallies in consecutive weeks to beat Virginia Tech and Cal, teams currently with 5-5 and 5-4 overall records. Outgunning Louisville in a 52-45 shootout marked Miami’s third straight game winning a one-score contest. While beating Louisville added an important Top 25 victory to the Hurricanes’ resume, their string of close calls made it clear that a loss in a one-score Atlantic Coast Conference game was probably inevitable. The 28-23 setback to Georgia Tech on Saturday was predictable enough that the playoff selection committee likely had a contingency plan for the ACC pecking order. In Tuesday’s initial reveal, SMU was the next-most highly ranked ACC team. At No. 13, despite sporting two Top 25 wins over Louisville and Pitt, the Mustangs were arguably the most egregiously underranked team in the standings. SMU will likely move into the top 12 by virtue of being the only undefeated ACC team in conference play, thus securing the conference's automatic bid. But where will it be slotted? The Mustangs were on a bye in Week 11, but in some ways, they lost as much as Miami did: Pitt’s 24-19 loss to Virginia likely removes a Top 25 win from SMU’s resume. For SMU to overtake Miami, there needs to be a nine-spot swing. With SMU idle, one of its signature wins losing value, and Boise State winning after being ranked one spot ahead of the Mustangs, the room for Rhett Lashlee’s squad to make a significant jump is limited. If anything other than Miami's loss most benefited SMU’s case, it could have been BYU’s loss to rival Utah in the nightcap. BYU defeated SMU earlier in the season, giving the Mustangs a quality loss. As long as the Cougars remained undefeated, even with the committee’s overall lack of enthusiasm for the Big 12, BYU would be a glass ceiling for SMU. Utah’s 21-19 win provided a fitting punctuation to an upset-filled Week 11 and likely relegated the Big 12 to fifth place among the five automatic qualifiers in the Playoff field. That group—which, through this week, had remained steady with Oregon in the Big Ten and Boise State—was otherwise shaken up by Saturday’s results. The SEC now has three teams with one loss in conference play, and Georgia isn’t one of them. The Bulldogs' placement in Tuesday’s rankings promises to be the most controversial insight into the committee’s strategy, regardless of where Georgia ranks. The Bulldogs beat Texas head-to-head and were rewarded last week by ranking ahead of the Longhorns. That made sense. Following that same logic, Georgia should now fall behind Alabama and Ole Miss in the SEC pecking order, which means the Bulldogs could fall out of the top 12 altogether. Texas and Tennessee remain firmly in the field, both 8-1 overall. Alabama, already in last week’s rankings, now has the same record as Georgia and the head-to-head advantage, which should place the Crimson Tide ahead of the Bulldogs. The same logic applies to Ole Miss, which was on the outside looking in on Nov. 5. Head-to-head results must mean something, which means Georgia should be out of the bracket for now. That could change when the Bulldogs face Tennessee in Week 12. In the meantime, sit with the reality that the heavy preseason favorite to steamroll its way back to the national championship could be eliminated from the field altogether by Nov. 16.

Here are three of our best picks for Sunday: Ever since it dropped back-to-back games bridging September and October, Buffalo has been nearly unstoppable. The Bills are riding a four-game winning streak and have averaged 29.5 points during that span, most recently hanging 30 on the Miami Dolphins in a three-point victory last Sunday. Meanwhile, turning to Joe Flacco under center didn’t pay off for Indianapolis last weekend, as the veteran signal-caller threw for only 179 yards and was picked off once in a 21-13 setback against the Minnesota Vikings. One offense is clicking, the other is in disarray, but oddsmakers seemingly have faith in the Colts’ ability to keep things close at home. Indianapolis is 3-1 at Lucas Oil Stadium this season, and it would be perfect there had it not been for a 29-27 loss to the Houston Texans in Week 1. But the Colts faithful will only be able to do so much on Sunday. With dual-threat quarterback Josh Allen and running backs James Cook and Ray Davis, a budding offensive weapon, Buffalo should have no problem barreling through an Indianapolis defense that allows the second-most rushing yards per game in the NFL (149.8).

Kelce has racked up 24 receptions (on 28 targets) for 190 yards and a touchdown over his past two games after catching 28 passes for 245 yards and no scores in his first six contests of the campaign. Still, Kelce finding the end zone just once by this point in the season is just plain wrong. He has yet to haul in a TD at home, but we think that changes this week.

San Francisco star running back Christian McCaffrey is scheduled to make his season debut after working through Achilles tendinitis. He rushed for 1,459 yards and 14 touchdowns during the 2023 season, also grabbing 67 receptions for 564 yards and an additional seven scores. When healthy, McCaffrey is the most dangerous back in the league. However, we aren’t under the impression that he is at 100 percent heading into the meeting with Tampa Bay. After all, this is a guy who was supposedly in line to play in the 49ers’ season opener. Not only did that not happen, but he also went on to miss the next eight weeks.

After opening with the franchise's first 3-0 start since 2010-11, the Lakers went 1-4 on a five-game road trip. A return home on Friday to face Philadelphia -- and a 116-106 win -- helped Los Angeles ro avoid a three-game skid. Anthony Davis scored 31 points to continue his torrid start to the season.  Davis has scored at least 31 points in six of his eight appearances and grabbed at least 11 rebounds in four outings. His four blocked shots versus the 76ers marked a season high. LeBron James recorded his 114th career triple-double on Friday with 21 points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds. Austin Reaves added 20 points for the Lakers, who improved to 3-1 when he scores at least that many this season.  Another two Lakers players who factored into Friday's win were Cam Reddish and D'Angelo Russell. Los Angeles coach JJ Redick offered praise for the duo after Russell scored 18 points off the bench and Reddish fulfilled a variety of needs.  ""Both those guys starred in the roles they had tonight,"" Redick said. ""Cam took one shot in 27 minutes but had a huge impact on the game defensively in the first half. I know we had three smash-screen assists coming out of set plays; Cam had two of them.  ""That's sacrifice. That's unselfishness.""  Russell, meanwhile, is one of five Lakers scorers averaging in double figures with 12.7 points per game. He joins Davis (32.4), James (23.7), Reaves (17.8) and Rui Hachimura (13.0). Hachimura scored nine points on Friday in his return to the lineup after missing the 131-114 loss at Memphis on Wednesday.  Toronto will play the fourth contest of a five-game road trip on Sunday. This swing has not been kind to the Raptors, as Saturday's 105-103 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers dropped Toronto to 0-3 in this stretch.  On Saturday, Ochai Agbaji and Immanuel Quickley each scored 21 points, Gradey Dick had 15 and Chris Boucher added 14 points off the bench. However, Toronto fell 15 points shy of its per-game scoring average through the previous nine games.  RJ Barrett, who came into Saturday's contest averaging a team-high 25.7 points per game, finished with only 13 versus the Clippers. Getting Barrett going, and pushing the tempo as a team, figure to be top priorities for Toronto on Sunday.  Raptors coach Darko Rajakovic has emphasized a fast pace predicated on ball movement. Toronto went into Los Angeles averaging almost 31 assists per game, most in the NBA.  ""It's the right way to play basketball,"" Rajakovic said on Saturday. ""We're a very young team and it's creating habits now of unselfishness, playing together and playing for each other  ""There are so many examples of great teams that play that way,"" he added, citing Nikola Jokic and his Denver Nuggets, the recent NBA Finals-winning Golden State teams, and the San Antonio Spurs championship teams of previous decades. ""It's not anything new.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Ducks, who have scored a league-low 27 goals in 13 games (4-7-2), bring a four-game losing streak into the contest. They have dropped the first three outings of a six-game homestand, getting outscored 14-5 in the process.  Anaheim comes in off a 5-2 loss to Minnesota on Friday, falling behind 3-0 in the first period against a Wild team that was playing the second half of a back-to-back set. Trevor Zegras backhanded a penalty shot try over the net in the second period and the Ducks finished 0-for-6 on the power play, managing just two shots on goal and failing to score during a key four-minute double-minor high-sticking penalty on defenseman Zach Bogosian midway through the third period while trailing 3-1.  ""I think any team, no matter how good you are or how old you are or how young you are, when you're not scoring, it's like the balloon is getting bigger and bigger,"" Cronin said. ""We're just waiting for it to pop in a good way and get some goals.""  Said Anaheim defenseman Brian Dumoulin: ""When goals aren't going in, obviously the guys can get frustrated and your game can slip a little because you cheat a little bit to the offensive side. I think we've just got to know that if we defend hard, we'll get chances off of it.""  Robby Fabbri scored his 100th career NHL goal in the loss and Mason McTavish also tallied for the Ducks, who outshot Minnesota, 35-31.  ""When you look back at it, we could have probably scored six goals,"" Cronin said. ""(But) would-have, could-have, should-have doesn't mean anything at the end of the game.""  Columbus also brings a four-game losing streak (0-3-1) into the contest and will be playing the second game of a back-to-back that began with a 5-2 loss at the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday night.  The Blue Jackets led 1-0 after one period on Dmitri Voronkov's tip-in goal but the Kings rebounded to take a 2-1 advantage in the second on goals by defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov and Warren Foegele. Trevor Moore then scored what proved to be the game-winning goal with his team shorthanded early in the third period.  ""Honestly I thought we played a solid game but at the end of the day we want to come out with a win,"" said forward Justin Danforth, who had two assists. ""We've got to find a way to win games. That's what playoff teams do. So we have to get back on track, get a little confidence back, and a big game tomorrow.""  Columbus coach Dean Evason said his team must cut down on the mistakes that led directly to the first three goals by the Kings.  ""The first goal we turn it over,"" Evason said. ""The second goal we make a huge mistake. The third goal we turn it over. That's three goals. We've got a 1-0 lead. In key areas of the ice we have to make the right reads or clearly not turn the puck over (and) give teams momentum to come back after us. And we did that here tonight.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise","Jack Hughes, Devils get first look at Sharks' Macklin Celebrini",https://deadspin.com/jack-hughes-devils-get-first-look-at-sharks-macklin-celebrini/,2024-11-10T12:23:12.218Z,"Jack Hughes is on the verge of reaching a notable milestone in his young career, and the New Jersey Devils are constantly finding the back of the net","Jack Hughes is on the verge of reaching a notable milestone in his young career, and the New Jersey Devils are constantly finding the back of the net lately. Hughes' current hot streak has the 2019 top overall pick one shy of 300 career points. Hughes will look to add to that total as the Devils attempt to earn their fourth win in a row when they oppose top overall 2024 pick Macklin Celebrini and the San Jose Sharks in Newark, N.J. Hughes is coming off his second straight three-point showing and heads into his first encounter with Celebrini with five goals in his past six games. He scored two goals in Saturday's 4-3 overtime over the host New York Islanders. The Devils star scored a power-play goal in the second period and then converted a breakaway 2:35 into overtime. He also had the primary assist on the tying goal by Stefan Noesen with 50 seconds left in regulation. ""Those are the moments you play hockey for,"" Devils captain Nico Hischier said. ""I think it's an emotional, tight game; I think we played a well enough game to win that game, and getting rewarded for it makes it that much better."" The latest big showing by Hughes gave New Jersey three straight wins and five wins in its last six games (5-1-0). Since allowing 23 goals in a four-game skid (0-2-2) from Oct. 19-25, the Devils have outscored foes 24-11 in the past six games, a stretch that includes shutout road wins versus the Vancouver Canucks and Edmonton Oilers. Dawson Mercer also scored a goal and defenseman Dougie Hamilton notched three assists on Saturday for the Devils, who allowed two goals in a span of 1:56 before overcoming a 3-1 deficit. Celebrini will be playing in his fourth game and first on the road because of a preseason hip injury that cost him the first 12 games. The Sharks are playing better of late by going 4-2-0 in their past six contests following a season-opening nine-game skid (0-7-2). San Jose began its marginal improvement with a 5-4 overtime win at the Utah Hockey Club on Oct. 28 before getting home wins over the Los Angeles Kings and Chicago Blackhawks. After splitting one-goal games versus Vancouver and the Columbus Blue Jackets, the 18-year-old had his first career two-goal game Thursday in a 5-2 home loss to the Minnesota Wild. Celebrini scored twice on even strength as the Sharks were 0-for-3 on the power play and are 2-for-20 since their only game with multiple power-play goals on Oct. 24. The Sharks also head into their opener of a four-game trip against Metropolitan Division opponents after failing to record more than 29 shots on goal in their previous five contests. ""We play some great teams, so it'll be a really good test,"" Celebrini said Thursday. ""We've shown we can beat some really good teams, and we're a really good team ourselves when we play like it. So, this will be a great test, especially on the road."" The Sharks may revert to their alignment from Thursday when William Eklund was dropped to the fourth line by coach Ryan Warsofsky. Eklund finished with 16 goals in his first full season in 2023-24 but has two goals in his first 14 games in 2024-25. ""We're going to continue to work with him, help him, and get through this,"" Warsofsky said. One of San Jose's 19 wins last season occurred on their visit to New Jersey. Eklund scored a goal in the Sharks' 6-3 win over the Devils on Dec. 1. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Jamal Haynes ran for 83 yards and a touchdown as the Yellow Jackets (6-4, 4-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) snapped a two-game skid. The Hurricanes (9-1, 5-1) lost for the first time despite Cam Ward's 348 passing yards and three touchdowns. Jacolby George led Miami with seven receptions for 88 yards. Ward fumbled on the Hurricanes' final possession with under two minutes remaining. Miami closed within 28-23 when Ward connected with Xavier Restrepo for a 38-yard TD with 6:07 left. Following a Georgia Tech punt, Ward was strip-sacked by Romello Height, and Jordan van den Berg recovered the fumble on the Hurricanes 17-yard line to ice the win. No. 1 Oregon 39, Maryland 18 Dillon Gabriel set an NCAA record with his 179th career touchdown and the Ducks shook off a slow start to defeat the Terrapins in Eugene, Ore. Gabriel was 23-for-34 passing for 183 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions for the Ducks (10-0, 7-0 Big Ten), who led 14-10 before scoring 25 of the game's final 33 points. Gabriel's record-setting touchdown came on a 3-yard toss to left tackle Gernorris Wilson that put Oregon up 29-10 midway through the third quarter. Gabriel surpassed former Houston quarterback Case Keenum, who accounted for 155 passing touchdowns and 23 rushing scores for the Cougars from 2007-11. For the Terrapins, (4-5, 1-5), who have lost two straight games, Billy Edwards Jr. completed 22 of 44 passes for 206 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions. No. 2 Ohio State 45, Purdue 0 Will Howard threw for three touchdowns and Jeremiah Smith set a pair of team records as the Buckeyes rolled past the Boilermakers in Columbus, Ohio. Smith had a 17-yard touchdown catch late in the first half to up the lead to 21-0 for the Buckeyes (8-1, 5-1 Big Ten). The score was Smith's ninth to pass Cris Carter's Ohio State freshman record for TD catches set in 1984. Smith needed three receptions to break Carter's first-year mark of 41, and he surpassed that in the first half with six catches for 87 yards. Howard was 21-of-26 passing for 260 yards, and TreVeyon Henderson ran for 85 yards on six carries. Purdue (1-8, 0-6) has lost eight straight games for its longest single-season losing streak since dropping 10 in a row in 2013. No. 16 Ole Miss 28, No. 3 Georgia 10 Behind Jaxson Dart, Caden Davis and an impressive defense, the Rebels toppled the Bulldogs in Oxford, Miss., denting the visitors' national title hopes in the process. Dart completed 13 of 22 passes for 199 yards, a touchdown and an interception and ran for a team-high 50 yards, while Davis made all five of his field-goal attempts as the Rebels (8-2, 4-2 Southeastern Conference) won their third straight game. Carson Beck went 20-for-31 passing for 186 yards but threw an interception and fumbled twice for the Bulldogs (7-2, 5-2), who had their four-game winning streak snapped.

No. 5 Texas 49, Florida 17 Quinn Ewers passed for 333 yards and a career-high five touchdowns over the game's first 33 minutes as the Longhorns romped past the Gators at Austin, Texas. The Longhorns (8-1, 4-1 SEC) flexed their talent and speed throughout the win as the teams played as SEC opponents for the first time. Ewers finished 19-of-27 passing without an interception, Jerrick Gibson rushed for 100 yards and a TD and Matthew Golden had two TD receptions. Aidan Warner, the Gators' walk-on, third-string quarterback, passed for 132 yards and was intercepted twice. Ja'Kobi Jackson rushed for 116 yards and a score while Jaden Baugh added 88 rushing yards and a TD for Florida (4-5, 2-4). No. 6 Penn State 35, Washington 6 Tight end Tyler Warren made a game-high eight receptions and rushed for two touchdowns as the Nittany Lions trounced the Huskies in State College, Pa. Drew Allar completed 20 of 28 passes for 220 yards and a touchdown for Penn State (8-1, 5-1 Big Ten), which could move up in the College Football Playoff rankings after losses by No. 3 Georgia and No. 4 Miami. Teammate Kaytron Allen rushed 20 times for 98 yards and a score. Quarterback Will Rogers III was 10-of-13 passing for 59 yards and one interception in the first half before being replaced by Demond Williams Jr., who was 6-of-10 passing for 60 yards and rushed for a team-high 38 yards on 10 attempts for Washington (5-5, 3-4).

Iamaleava completed 8 of 13 passes for 174 yards but didn't return for the second half after sustaining an upper-body injury late in the second quarter. However, the Volunteers (8-1, 5-1 SEC) led 20-7 at the half and weren't truly threatened by the Bulldogs (2-8, 0-6). Sampson collected 149 yards on 30 carries, going over the 1,000-yard mark for the first time in his career. Tennessee rolled up 452 total yards, split almost equally between rushing (240) and passing (212). Michael Van Buren Jr. had a rough night for Mississippi State, hitting just 10 of 26 passes for 92 yards with an interception. No. 8 Indiana 20, Michigan 15 Kurtis Rourke went 17-for-28 passing for 206 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Hoosiers to a win over the Wolverines in Bloomington, Ind. Indiana (10-0, 7-0 Big Ten) has now won 10 games in a season for the first time in school history and kept its hopes for a conference title and CFP berth alive. Clinging to a 17-15 edge in the fourth quarter, Indiana took a 20-15 lead with 2:34 remaining on a 41-yard field goal by Nicolas Radicic. On the ensuing possession, Michigan (5-5, 3-4) failed to convert a fourth-and-10 after a pass from Davis Warren to Peyton O'Leary came up just short of the marker. Indiana took over on the Michigan 42-yard line with 1:35 left and ran out the clock. No. 9 BYU 22, Utah 21 Will Ferrin kicked three field goals, the final one from 44 yards out with three seconds left, as the Cougars rallied to beat the Utes in Salt Lake City. Jake Retzlaff threw for 219 yards to lead the Cougars. LJ Martin added 68 rushing yards. BYU (9-0, 6-0 Big 12) did not score an offensive touchdown until 12:35 remained in the fourth quarter. Utah (4-5, 1-5) has lost five straight games for the first time since 2013. Brandon Rose threw for 112 yards and two touchdowns and added 55 yards on the ground in his first career start for the Utes. No. 10 Notre Dame 52, Florida State 3 Riley Leonard passed for one touchdown and rushed for two more as the Fighting Irish crushed the Seminoles in South Bend, Ind. Jadarian Price added 95 rushing yards and a touchdown for Notre Dame (8-1), which won its seventh game in a row. Leonard completed 14 of 27 passes for 215 yards and a touchdown and carried the ball 11 times for 70 yards and two scores. Lawrance Toafili had 16 carries for 77 yards to lead the Seminoles (1-9), whose nightmare season continued with their sixth consecutive loss. Brock Glenn completed 5 of 18 passes for 52 yards and two interceptions, and Luke Kromenhoek completed 5 of 8 passes for 37 yards. No. 11 Alabama 42, No. 15 LSU 13 Jalen Milroe rushed for a career-high 185 yards and ran for four touchdowns as the Crimson Tide never trailed in a victory against the Tigers in Baton Rouge, La. Milroe, who also passed for 109 yards, matched his best single-game rushing TD total and surpassed his previous rushing-yardage high of 155, both of which came in a 42-28 victory against LSU last season. The Crimson Tide (7-2, 4-2 SEC) strengthened their CFP chances with their first conference road victory of the season. Garrett Nussmeier passed for 239 yards and a touchdown, threw two interceptions and lost a fumble as the Tigers (6-3, 3-2) suffered a major blow to their already slim playoff hopes. Alabama outgained LSU 420-343 overall and held a 311-104 advantage in rushing yards. No. 12 Boise State 28, Nevada 21 Ashton Jeanty rushed for 209 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Broncos to a victory over the visiting Wolf Pack in a Mountain West Conference matchup.

Allison has his name littered throughout the record books, ranking fourth all time in NASCAR premier series wins (85), second in top-five finishes (336) and 14th in starts (718).  Those were among the accomplishments that landed Allison in NASCAR's second Hall of Fame Class back in 2011. He was also a three-time Daytona 500 winner, four-time Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway winner and three-time Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway winner.  During his 1988 victory at Daytona, Allison had to hold off his son, Davey, to take the checkered flag.  ""Bobby Allison personified the term ‘racer.' Though he is best known as one of the winningest drivers in NASCAR Cup Series history, his impact on the sport extends far beyond the record books,"" NASCAR chairman and CEO Jim France said in a statement. ""As a driver, he won races and championships across several NASCAR divisions. But as the leader of the famous ‘Alabama Gang,' Bobby connected with fans in a profound manner.  ""In the most significant ways, he gave his all to our sport. On behalf of the France family and all of NASCAR, I offer my deepest condolences to Bobby's family, friends and fans on the loss of a NASCAR giant."" Named one of NASCAR's 75 Greatest Drivers back in 2023, Allison put together a career that started in 1961 and ended midway through the 1988 campaign.  In addition to everything he was able to accomplish in the Cup Series, Allison won twice in what is now known as the Xfinity Series and took home an International Race of Champions title in 1980. He was named NASCAR's most popular driver on six occasions.  Allison and his younger brother Donnie teamed up with modified racer Red Farmer to take over the short-track racing scene down in the Hueytown, Ala., area during the late 1950s, leading to the inception of the original ""Alabama Gang.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

""For the last month, I have actively participated in and respected the confidentiality of an ongoing school inquiry,"" Golden wrote on X. ""I have recently engaged (attorney) Ken Turkel to advise me on my ability to bring defamation claims while this confidential investigation is ongoing. My family and I appreciate the support we have received and remain confident the university will continue its efforts to finish its review promptly."" The Alligator, citing Title IX documents filed on Sept. 27, said Golden has been accused of potential violations of the school's Gender Equity Policy. They include acts of sexual exploitation, sexual harassment and the stalking of Florida students over the past year. Per the report, Golden sent ""photos and videos of his genitalia while traveling for UF,"" used social media to make sexual advances and request sexual favors, and stalked women. He is alleged to have taken photos of women, then send the pictures to them, and also of making visits to places where he knew he could find those same women. The Alligator interviewed two women who said they had complained about Golden, and they corroborated the Title IX documents. They said Golden had followed, then unfollowed, numerous women on social media to avoid suspicion, and one of them said his reach to women was vast. He told many women they were ""his drug"" or ""his good luck charm"" before games, she said. ""He just had this manipulation tactic over everyone,"" the woman told The Alligator.

""I think Hawaii is more good for me, more comfortable, and then when I ... came on site, everything is new and then grass and read is very hard for me,"" Kim said. ""But getting better from now, more easier.""  Bogeys at the par-4 second and par-3 ninth on Saturday ended up costing Guseva. She did have five birdies, including a pair at Nos. 11 and 13, but she was unable to become the first Russian golfer to win on the LPGA Tour.  ""Obviously congrats to A Lim for a great game. I really did my best out there. I never gave up. Every hole like I gave just my 100 percent and more than that,"" Guseva said. ""I enjoyed it out there. I enjoy playing golf. I enjoy the crowds.""  Auston Kim birdied four of her first six holes before slowing down, as she recorded just one more birdie the rest of the way during a bogey-free round. She shared low-round honors with Japan's Nasa Hataoka, who also posted a 5-under 67.  Auston Kim landed in third, three strokes behind A Lim Kim, while Hataoka came in fourth, four shots off the lead.  ""It got really tough in the back. I got off to a really hot start. Made a lot of good shots and really good putts on the front nine. Putter got a little cold after the ninth hole,"" Auston Kim said. ""Just kept telling myself, ‘Like you're hitting really good shots. You're visualizing while you're feeling everything very well. Just keep giving yourself chances.'"" Ryann O'Toole (70) and Yuri Yoshida of Japan (69) tied for fifth.  South Korean Jin Young Ko (70) came in seventh, Lindy Duncan (68) ended up in eighth and Hyo Joo Kim of South Korea (69) and Angel Yin (69) were T9.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

""I was playing within the offense and being aggressive, taking what they gave me,"" he said. ""I was going with moving the ball, finding great shots and taking them."" Mgbako and the No. 17 Hoosiers will try to make it 2-0 Sunday when they welcome Eastern Illinois for another nonconference clash in Bloomington, Ind. Mgbako nailed 13 of 17 shots from the field, including 4 of 5 from the 3-point line, and also chipped in nine rebounds. His performance stood out on a night where Indiana never trailed and wasn't pushed in the second half, but it didn't play at the level coach Mike Woodson hoped it would. ""Offensively, we came out with great intentions,"" Woodson said. ""The ball moved early, but then we got stale in terms of moving and making the extra pass. We've been having some good practices. ... I've got to get us better in that area."" Woodson wasn't happy that his team committed 16 turnovers against an opponent that probably won't bring the same level of ball pressure they'll see in the Big Ten Conference. Washington State transfer Myles Rice had 11 points in his first game but also coughed up five turnovers. Woodson said most of the turnovers were correctible, but he added that Rice must be more patient and develop into more of a true point guard. Rice played as more of a combo guard last year when he helped the Cougars reach the second round of the NCAA Tournament. One solid aspect of the Hoosiers' opener was their defense. They allowed the Cougars to make only 35.2 percent of their shots, including 5 of 26 on 3-pointers, and earned a 43-34 advantage on the boards. Meanwhile, Eastern Illinois (1-1) followed up a season-opening blowout loss at Illinois by routing Division III opponent Earlham (Ind.) 97-61 on Wednesday. Six players scored in double figures for the Panthers, led by Artese Stapleton's 17 points, as they shot 52.2 percent from the field. Eastern Illinois is coming off a 14-18 season and was picked for a middle-of-the-pack finish in the Ohio Valley Conference. Panthers coach Marty Simmons knows all about the atmosphere his team will face in Assembly Hall. He played for the late Bob Knight before transferring to Evansville and playing for former Knight assistant Jim Crews. Simmons, in his fourth season at Eastern Illinois, says this will be his best group of players since he took the helm. ""I think we're moving in the right direction,"" he said. ""We made a good step last year. We have our best returning class. I think this team has a chance to be pretty good."" Simmons said the key to his team will be the progress it makes defensively. Opponents made 44 percent of their shots against the Panthers last season. ""We have to be more consistent,"" he said. Indiana has won both meetings in the series, earning an 88-49 win nine years ago in their last matchup. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Nick Davidson added 14 points and nine rebounds and Tre Coleman finished with 10 points for Nevada (2-0). Washington's Tyree Ihenacho scored 13 of his team-high 15 points in the first half. Tyler Harris was the only other double-figure scorer for Washington (1-1) with 10 points. The Wolf Pack pulled away with a 10-0 run after 3:30 remained in the game. Eight of the points were scored at the free-throw line with Sanders making four and Davidson three. Nevada outscored Washington at the free-throw line by nine points, making 17 of 25 while the Huskies were 8-of-13. Washington missed seven straight field-goal attempts when Nevada went on its late game-clinching run.

The Memphis star forward put up a season-high 39 points in Friday's victory over the Washington Wizards and seeks another strong effort when the Grizzlies visit the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday night. Jackson made five 3-pointers -- also a season-best -- and controlled things in the interior as Memphis routed the visiting Wizards 128-104.  ""He had the opportunity to be the primary playmaker, diversify his game and a couple pick-and-rolls were snuck in there,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said of Jackson. ""... He was able to get the rim at will and obviously shot the ball really well. ""It was great to see him get that opportunity and take advantage of it."" Jackson was in the go-to role with point guard Ja Morant out due to a right hip injury and shooting guard Desmond Bane (oblique) still sidelined.  Morant was injured in a fall during Wednesday's 131-114 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. The Grizzlies announced Saturday that he is week-to-week after suffering a posterior hip subluxation (without dislocation) and multiple Grade 1 pelvic muscle strains. As a result, Memphis will again rely on Jackson, who is averaging 22 points and shooting 55.9 percent from the field in eight games. After missing the first two games due a hamstring strain sustained during the team's first practice, the 25-year-old Jackson has played well. Friday's effort was his second 30-point outing and marked the third time in the past four games in which he scored 20 or more points. Last season, Jackson averaged 22.5 points in 66 games. Scotty Pippen Jr. also contributed on Friday with his first career triple-double. He had 11 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds while starting against Washington. ""Offensively, he's moving the ball,"" Jenkins said. ""And he's getting into the paint, which is a huge priority for us ... This kid is taking care of his body, he's doing the work, he's watching film. When he can have that two-way impact, that's huge for us."" The Grizzlies have won four of their past five games with the wins coming by 23, 17, 17 and 24 points. Memphis opens a three-game trip with a stop in Portland as the Trail Blazers begin a four-game homestand. Portland is coming off a 127-102 road loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves during a contest in which big man Robert Williams III returned to the court after missing 12-plus months due to a major knee injury. Williams scored 13 points in 17 minutes off the bench, making 4 of his 5 field-goal attempts and all four of his free throws. ""I felt good, man,"" Williams said. ""Just trying to get the defensive spirit back with the team, you know, be that leader. Obviously, we wanted to come out with a win, we didn't. But obviously it feels great to be back on the court."" Williams' return gives the Trail Blazers a deep post trio that includes veteran starter Deandre Ayton and first-round pick Donovan Clingan. Portland also has more versatility at guard with Shaedon Sharpe back from a shoulder injury. He had just six points on 2-of-8 shooting in 21 minutes against Minnesota in his second game of the season. In his first, Sharpe had 13 points on 6-of-9 shooting in 20 minutes during a 118-105 road loss against the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday. ""Just trying to get guys in there and you want to get them in and there's also minutes restrictions,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said. ""There's all kind of things that you have to deal with that make it tough to kind of get a rhythm."" The Trail Blazers went 3-1 against Memphis last season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Stewart-Haas Racing's Riley Herbst's No. 98 Ford passed Allgaier's No. 7 JR Motorsports Chevrolet for the NASCAR Xfinity Series Championship Race win on the last lap of double-overtime for his second win of the season and joined the new series champ Allgaier in twin celebratory burnouts on the front stretch of the mile-track.   ""I said all weekend, I don't know what the plan is, but He has a reason for everything and tonight is true of that, this is mind-blowing, it really is,"" said Allgaier, his voice already hoarse and strained from screaming in happiness, but the smile unshakable as his young daughters came in for a hug for dad.   ""This team never gave up. (Crew chief) Jim Pohlman and his leadership skills are second to none. He told me all weekend that we were going to have a chance and we tried to give it away every way we could.""   It was an emotional outcome for the 38-year old Allgaier, who joked that he was just trying to make the race exciting for the fans. He has qualified for the Championship 4 seven times, finishing runner-up twice, including last year.   The obstacles Allgaier faced happened well before the race's green flag.  His primary car was destroyed in a crash four laps into Friday's opening practice session. In a backup car Saturday night, Allgaier started last in the 38th car field but had moved into the top 10 by lap 26. He was then penalized twice - first for a re-start violation and then for speeding - dropping him to 35th on-track and a lap down on Lap 107 of the scheduled 200-lapper. Allgaier then crept into the Top 10 worked his way forward - moving from sixth place to second on the first overtime restart. He started on the front row of the second overtime restart, but was passed on the final lap by Herbst for the race win. Allgaier's second place finish was still good enough to land the championship.   It marked the third career win for the 25-year old Las Vegas native Herbst, who crossed the line .247-second ahead of Allgaier and led 167 of the 213 laps.   ""I knew we were going to have a fast race car, these guys have been working on this race car and I knew we were going to be really really fast,"" said Herbst, whose SHR team is closing at the conclusion of the season.  ""It's been a really tough week at the shop, really emotional time. I'm forever grateful to every man and woman at Stewart-Haas Racing. They gave me a really fast car today and I can't thank everyone enough."" It was actually fellow championship contender - reigning champ Cole Custer - who mounted the most consistent challenge to Herbst. He ran up front for most of the race, just off the pace of his SHR teammate and ultimately finished eighth in the No. 00 SHR Ford - his effort answered last year's title with a runner-up in this year's championship standings.   The other two championship contenders, Kaulig Racing's A.J. Allmendinger and Richard Childress Racing's Austin Hill finished ninth and 10th, respectively.

In all, 11 players recorded a point for the Kings, with Warren Foegele notching a goal and an assist and Anze Kopitar and Adrian Kempe collecting a pair of assists apiece. Columbus jumped out to a 1-0 lead on Dmitri Voronkov's goal with 6:34 left in the opening period. The second-year pro, who scored 34 points in 75 games last season, notched his first point of the season, redirecting Justin Danforth's centering pass past Kings goalie David Rittich (24 saves).   The Kings, though, would take over in the second period, scoring twice in a two-minute span.   Vladislav Gavrikov tied it against his former team with a snap shot through traffic 4:16 into the second. The defenseman's second of the season and second in as many games came off assists by Adrian Kempe and Anze Kopitar.   Foegele gave Los Angeles a 2-1 lead at 6:12 of the second as the hosts cashed in on a turnover in the neutral zone. Akil Thomas and Samuel Helenius earned their first assists of the season on the winger's sixth goal of the campaign.   Trevor Moore's short-handed goal just 30 seconds into the third, his second tally of the season, extended the Kings' lead to 3-1. Columbus responded on Ivan Provorov's first goal of the season 19 seconds later on the power play.   That was as close as the Blue Jackets would get as they lost their fourth straight (0-3-1). Alex Laferriere's ninth goal of the season came with 12:55 remaining as he deflected Joel Edmundson's shot past Columbus goalie Elvis Merzlikins (18 saves). Foegele earned the secondary assist.

The Minnesota Wild happily cannot relate. Minnesota enters its visit to Chicago on Sunday with five wins in six games, including consecutive 5-2 victories at San Jose and Anaheim and two other efforts of five goals. It's all helped add up to a 10-2-2 start, the best in club history over 14 contests. ""We've taken it a game at a time, honestly,"" Minnesota forward Frederick Gaudreau said. ""I think if you do that, you get results and you can get addicted to that feeling of just going at it every single day and not focusing too far ahead."" Chicago returns home before a two-game Western swing, facing questions about consistency. After seemingly turning a corner during a 3-2 road trip bridging October and November, the Blackhawks sputtered Wednesday and Thursday, losing 4-1 to visiting Detroit and then 3-1 at Dallas. Chicago recorded just five shots on goal in the first period and fell behind the Stars 2-0 before Tyler Bertuzzi put the team on the board with a power-play goal midway through the third. ""We weren't ready to start tonight,"" Bertuzzi said. ""Obviously we made a push in the third, but it was too late. We needed to be ready to go tonight and play a full 60 and we came up short. ""We need to shoot more. Everyone. Whether it's the (defense) from the top or a forward getting in the slot, we can't just keep trying to make the cute plays. We've got to shoot it and get the rebounds."" Claiming control of the puck would help. Chicago won 16 of 56 faceoffs at Dallas, with Philipp Kurashev contributing five. ""When you start out without a puck, that's a hard thing,"" Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said. ""We're chasing the game quite a bit."" Richardson is encouraged that Chicago seemingly has flipped the script on last season, when chatter about moral victories was common in the dressing room. ""We're just going to take this and put this intensity we had in the third period and bring it to the next game,"" he said. ""I've liked our character and our pushback after a game like this all year long, so I'm expecting that again from our players."" The Blackhawks will hope to slow Minnesota's moxie away from home. The Wild boast seven road victories, most in the NHL entering Saturday. Kirill Kaprizov starred in Minnesota's most recent road triumph, contributing two goals and an assist on Friday in Anaheim. He also recorded a three-point night in San Jose and carries to Chicago a streak of eight straight multipoint road games. ""He's driving our team. That's the biggest thing,"" Marcus Foligno said. ""You need your horses going. He's our star player. When he's going, the whole bench is going."" Gaudreau, who assisted on Foligno's goal against the Ducks, has two goals and six assists during a career-best, six-game point streak.

It was the second straight loss for the Panthers (7-2, 3-2 ACC), likely eliminating their chances to reach the College Football Playoff or ACC Championship Game.   The Cavaliers (5-4, 3-3) ended a three-game skid and moved closer to gaining bowl eligibility for the first time under third-year coach Tony Elliott.   Anthony Colandrea passed for 143 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions for Virginia.   Nate Yarnell had a touchdown pass and two interceptions for Pitt after taking over for starter Eli Holstein, who left with an apparent head injury in the third quarter. Desmond Reid paced the Panthers with 123 yards from scrimmage.   Pitt had a final chance to take the lead before Yarnell's pass was intercepted by Corey Thomas Jr. with 1:40 left.   Virginia opened the scoring in the second quarter with some trickery. Cavaliers receiver Suderian Harrison got the ball on a reverse and threw a 27-yard pass to Colandrea to the 1-yard line. Brown ran it in on the next snap for a 7-0 lead.   Later in the quarter, the Panthers put together a 12-play, 80-yard drive, capped by Daniel Carter's 1-yard run to tie the score with 4:48 remaining in the half.   An interception by Kyle Louis set up a 44-yard field goal by Ben Sauls to give Pitt its first lead at 10-7 with 1:59 left.   Sauls hit a 48-yarder with eight seconds left to give the Panthers a 13-7 lead at halftime.   Momentum shifted to Virginia in the third quarter. Holstein left the game after getting hit in the helmet by Virginia linebacker Trey McDonald, who was thrown out for targeting.   After Jonas Sanker blocked a 45-yard field goal attempt by Sauls, Colandrea put the Cavaliers in front 14-13 with a 24-yard touchdown pass to Brown.   Virginia got the ball back after Sanker intercepted Yarnell's pass. Four plays later, Kobe Pace's 3-yard touchdown run made it 21-13 with 3:34 left in the third.   Yarnell's 4-yard TD pass to Gavin Bartholomew cut the deficit to 21-19 with 10:32 to play. That's where the score remained after a holding penalty wiped out Bartholomew's two-point conversion catch.   The Cavaliers extended the lead to 24-19 on a 32-yard field goal by Will Bettridge to cap a 16-play, 60-yard drive that chewed up 8:26.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Heisman Trophy candidate topped 200 yards for the fourth time this season and raised his season totals to 1,734 rushing yards and 23 touchdowns on the ground. He entered the day as the national leader in both categories. Maddux Madsen completed 9 of 20 passes for 119 yards, one touchdown and one interception for the Broncos (8-1, 5-0 MW), who won their seventh straight game. Matt Lauter had a touchdown catch as Boise State beat Nevada for the 18th time in the past 20 meetings. Jeanty became the fourth Boise State running back to top the 1,700-yard mark in a single season and finished the night second on the list. Jay Ajayi set the school record of 1,823 yards in 2014, while Ian Johnson (1,713 in 2006) and Jeremy McNichols (1,709 in 2016) also topped the mark. Brendon Lewis was 17-of-26 passing for 188 yards and one touchdown for Nevada (3-8, 0-5), which lost its fourth consecutive game. Jaden Smith caught a 36-yard touchdown pass with 2:19 left that kept the Wolf Pack in the game. But Jeanty's 17-yard run on the ensuing possession gave Boise State a first down. A short time later, Jeanty scampered for 10 yards and another first down to seal it. The score was tied at 14 at the break before the Broncos moved ahead to stay behind a dominating eight-play, 95-yard drive to start the third quarter. Jeanty went the final yard for the touchdown. Boise State took a 28-14 advantage on Jeanty's 2-yard run with 10:05 left in the contest. However, Nevada bounced back and was threatening to make it a one-score game when it faced fourth-and-goal from the Boise State 1-yard line. But Lewis and Sean Dollars botched the exchange and Jeremiah Earby of the Broncos recovered in the end zone for a touchback. Boise State jumped out to a 14-0 lead before the game was 11 minutes old. Jeanty's rushes moved the ball down the field on the Broncos' first possession, which ended with Madsen's 11-yard scoring pass to Lauter. With 4:12 left in the period, Jeanty powered through a Nevada defender on a 4-yard scoring run. Lewis got the Wolf Pack on the board with a dazzling 17-yard burst with 57 seconds left in the opening quarter. Nevada tied the game on a trick play with 6:14 left in the half. The ball was handed to Marcos Bellon. The receiver tossed a short pass to Caleb Ramseur, who broke two tackles en route to finishing off a 44-yard scoring play. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Young's touchdown capped off a wild finish, with four touchdowns between the teams in the final 3:18. The Tigers (7-2, 3-2 SEC) kept their College Football Playoff hopes alive while the Sooners' bowl hopes took a major hit. Oklahoma (5-5, 1-5) needs one more win in its final two games -- against Alabama and LSU -- to extend its bowl streak to 26 seasons. Missouri tied it on Theo Wease Jr.'s 10-yard touchdown catch from Drew Pyne with 1:03 left. It didn't take long for the Tigers to come up with another big play. Triston Newson hit Sooners quarterback Jackson Arnold in the backfield, knocking the ball free, and Young picked it up and returned it for the score. Not long before Wease's touchdown, it looked like the game had turned disastrous for the Tigers. Billy Bowman returned a fumble 43 yards for a touchdown with 2:00 left to put Oklahoma in front 23-16. But Pyne quickly directed an eight-play, 75-yard touchdown drive to tie it and set up Young's late heroics. The teams combined for just 535 total yards, with Missouri outgaining the Sooners 278-257. Pyne finished 14-of-27 for 143 yards and three touchdowns. Arnold finished 15-of-24 for just 74 yards as the Sooners turned the ball over four times. Wease had four catches for 70 yards and two touchdowns. Oklahoma tied the game with 3:18 left on a bit of trickery. Running back Taylor Tatum took a handoff from Arnold on third down then turned to throw it back to Arnold, who caught it and ran in for an 18-yard touchdown. On the third play of the next drive, Sammy Omosigho hit Missouri's Jamal Roberts, popping the ball free. Bowman scooped it up and took it in for the score. Pyne threw three touchdowns in the second half, including a 5-yard touchdown to Brett Norfleet with 8:47 left. But the point-after attempt was missed, keeping Missouri's lead 16-9. That's when the Sooners finally answered, with a 12-play, 75-yard touchdown drive to tie the game. Oklahoma's Zach Schmit hit three field goals, including a career-long 56-yarder as time expired in the second quarter, to send the Sooners into halftime leading 9-3. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Langer got off to a hot start at Phoenix Country Club, picking up three birdies within his first five holes. He finished with five on the day against one bogey and sits at 13-under 200 for the tournament, one shot better than defending champion Steven Alker of New Zealand.  ""Didn't putt as well as the first two days, made a couple early on and then kind of didn't get the pace,"" Langer said. ""It was a little short at times and just didn't make as many. Played very solid, hit the ball very well, gave myself a bunch of chances and pretty happy overall."" Alker shared low-round honors with Australia's Richard Green by recording an 8-under 63.  Both Alker and Green put together a phenomenal showing on the front nine, with Alker pairing six birdies and three pars and Green collecting seven birdies and two pars.  ""It's just heated up,"" Alker said of his putter. ""I just quiet the noise a little bit and settle it down and softened up my grip a little bit. Just small things go a long way. I've been seeing my lines good and rolling it good.""  Green finished with nine birdies and a bogey at the par-3 13th to climb six spots up the leaderboard and into sole possession of third at 11-under 202. He is two strokes behind Langer and trailing Alker by one.  With such a tight race atop the leaderboard, Langer knows that he has to bring his A-game on Sunday.  ""Well, I think I've got to continue to play aggressive and hit as many fairways as I possibly can and as many greens,"" Langer said. ""The key for me is making putts. I've got to try and hit 15, 16, 17 greens in regulation if I can and make a bunch of putts."" Alex Cejka of Germany (68 on Saturday), Jerry Kelly (66) and Stewart Cink (75) are in fourth, fifth and sixth, respectively. Cink really struggled, ending up with five bogeys and a double bogey on his card.

North Florida (2-0), of the Atlantic Sun Conference, earned the program's first victory over a team from the Southeastern Conference with an opening-night, 74-71 win at South Carolina on Monday. The Ospreys then pounded Charleston Southern 90-66 at home on Thursday. ""Guys really stepped up,"" North Florida coach Matthew Driscoll said after the win over the Gamecocks. ""A lot of big shots. Guys made huge plays, huge rebounds, huge defensive stops and really, really proud of our spirit and what we did as (a) unit. It takes a village to do these kinds of things and I think our guys are continuing to grow."" Jaylen Smith, part of last season's ASUN All-Freshman Team, led the Ospreys with 16 points in the win over South Carolina, then had 11 against Charleston Southern. Freshman Josh Harris had 23 points and eight rebounds against the latter.  Graduate transfer Liam Murphy has recovered from a torn labrum that cost him the entire 2023-24 season and is averaging 16.5 points through the first two games of the campaign.  North Florida is 0-19 against teams currently in the ACC. It has never faced Georgia Tech. Georgia Tech had little trouble against ASUN opponent West Georgia in its season opener, winning 85-62 on Wednesday. It was the largest margin of victory for the Yellow Jackets (1-0) since Damon Stoudamire became coach a season ago. ""I think what I'm trying to find out, see guys get better, see the group get better as a unit, but then just keep finding guys that I can trust,"" Stoudamire said. ""We just gotta keep building brick by brick. And our trajectory just gotta keep going in the right direction."" Newcomer Javian McCollum scored 18 points on Wednesday to surpass the 1,000-point mark for his career. He was Oklahoma's leading scorer last season.

Milroe, who also passed for 109 yards, matched his best single-game rushing touchdown total and surpassed his previous rushing yardage high of 155, both of which came in a 42-28 victory against LSU last season. The Crimson Tide (7-2, 4-2 SEC) strengthened their College Football Playoff chances with their first conference road victory of the season.   Garrett Nussmeier passed for 239 yards and a touchdown, threw two interceptions and lost a fumble as the Tigers (6-3, 3-2) suffered a major blow to their already slim playoff hopes.

Alabama then drove 80 yards, the final 19 of which came on Milroe's third rushing touchdown. The score held at 28-6 until the first play of the fourth quarter, when Milroe ran 72 yards for his final score. Richard Young added an 8-yard touchdown for the Crimson Tide with 2:07 left before Nussmeier threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Kyren Lacy with 11 seconds remaining.   Alabama opened the scoring less than five minutes into the game. The Crimson Tide received the opening kickoff and drove 75 yards, with Milroe running off the final 39 to make it 7-0 with 10:49 left in the first quarter. Milroe completed all three of his pass attempts for 38 yards on the drive.

Jusuf Nurkic made a tiebreaking free throw with eight-tenths of a second remaining Friday night, giving Phoenix a 114-113 win over the host Dallas Mavericks. It not only gave the Suns, leaders of the Pacific Division, their seventh consecutive win, but also their third in a row by three or fewer points. Phoenix's eight victories this season have come by a total of 37 points. ""It feels like every night it's been one,"" Suns coach Mike Budenholzer observed after his team's seventh win by six or fewer points. ""Winning close games on the road builds confidence, builds toughness."" Phoenix has worked its close-game magic at home as well. Before heading to Dallas, the Suns went 3-0 on a homestand in which they beat the Portland Trail Blazers by six, the Philadelphia 76ers by two and the Miami Heat by three. On a team featuring Kevin Durant, who will miss about two weeks with a left calf strain, and Devin Booker, Nurkic has been the Suns' most productive fourth-quarter player with a team-best plus-21. He leads the team in fourth-quarter field goal percentage (75.0) and offensive rebounds (six), and trails Royce O'Neale 18-17 for the team lead in total rebounds. He will match up Sunday with Kings star Domantas Sabonis, who recorded his eighth consecutive double-double with 23 points and 12 rebounds in Friday's 107-98 home loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. Sabonis had three consecutive triple-doubles, missing a fourth straight by one assist, when the Kings lost three of five in a rare five-game season series with the Suns last year. Two of the triple-doubles came in losses at Phoenix in January (21 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists) and February (35 points, 18 rebounds, 12 assists). The big man contributed to one of the Kings' biggest problems on Friday -- 3-point shooting. Sacramento missed 23 of its 26 attempts from deep (11.5 percent), the fifth time in the last six games in which the Kings have made 33.3 percent or less. Sabonis was 0-for-2. Other than De'Aaron Fox (2-for-5), Sacramento starters went 0-for-13, including Keegan Murray's six straight misses. Unfazed by his club's early-season slump, Kings coach Mike Brown expressed confidence that his guys would come right back firing against the Suns. ""It doesn't matter who we play. We want to let it fly,"" he said. ""We feel like we're a good 3-point shooting team. Although the numbers might not point that direction right now, we have guys who can knock that shot down. ""Any time you touch the paint, especially in today's NBA, everybody converges. So we want to touch the paint, let that thing fly and hopefully knock down shots."" At 30.7 percent, the Kings sit near the bottom of the NBA rankings in 3-point field goal percentage this season. The Suns, with O'Neale having made 52.6 percent and Durant 42.9, have been among the best at 38.3 percent. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Drew Allar completed 20 of 28 passes for 220 yards and a touchdown for Penn State (8-1 overall, 5-1 Big Ten), which could move up in the College Football Playoff rankings after losses by No. 3 Georgia and No. 4 Miami. Teammate Kaytron Allen rushed 20 times for 98 yards and a score. The Nittany Lions had a 486-193 edge in total offense. The normally staid Penn State offense came up with some intriguing plays in taking a 28-0 halftime lead. Backup quarterback Beau Pribula came off the bench and scored on an 8-yard run around the left end to open the scoring with 3:48 left in the first quarter. That capped a nine-play, 72-yard drive after Washington's Grady Gross hit the upright on a 45-yard field goal attempt. Facing third-and-goal from the UW 2-yard line with 9:23 remaining in the second, Warren -- a finalist for the Paul Hornung Award as college football's most versatile player -- lined up as the quarterback in a Wildcat formation. Warren took the snap and vaulted into the end zone to make it 14-0. With 3:23 left in the quarter, Penn State faced the same situation -- third-and-goal from the 2 -- and again used Warren in the Wildcat formation. This time he muscled his way over the goal line behind the left tackle. Allar then threw an 8-yard scoring strike to Julian Fleming with 23 seconds left in the half. Penn State's Nicholas Singleton returned the second-half kickoff 97 yards, but the touchdown was called back because of a holding penalty.

UW quarterback Will Rogers III was 10-of-13 passing for 59 yards and one interception in the first half before being replaced by Demond Williams Jr., who was 6-of-10 passing for 60 yards and rushed for a team-high 38 yards on 10 attempts. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Because Logano's car had to go through inspection two extra times before passing, he lost the benefit of getting to select his pit stop, and his car chief was ejected for the race. Logano did not appear to be overly concerned, however.   ""We feel confident,"" Logano said. ""I feel like our car is strong.   ""We feel strong about our team and these type of pressure situations, we feel very solid as far as our team and these moments. We're just executing our plan.""   His Penske teammate Blaney also remained confident despite the qualifying setback.   ""Our lap obviously didn't go well, I just got kind of free going into (Turn) 1 and ruined it all and couldn't really make it back up,"" Blaney said.

""We'll just kind of take it how we can get it tomorrow, just work through the first handful of laps and kinda start marching forward. Pretty similar to last year. Hopefully, it ends the same. If we can charge through the field, I think our race car is good enough we can make that happen.""   Byron was pleased to get that first pit stall pick with his qualifying effort, but had hoped to turn in a faster lap. He was quickest in the opening round.   ""Sucks, didn't just quite get the lap I wanted in the second lap but feel really good about our race car and get first pit pick and that's huge.

Gabriel was 23 for 34 for 183 yards passing with three touchdowns and no interceptions for the Ducks (10-0, 7-0 Big Ten), who led 14-10 before scoring 25 of the game's final 33 points. His record-setting touchdown came on a 3-yard toss to left tackle Gernorris Wilson that put Oregon up 29-10 midway through the third quarter.  Gabriel surpassed former Houston quarterback Case Keenum, who accounted for 155 passing touchdowns and 23 rushing scores for the Cougars from 2007-11. Billy Edwards Jr. completed 22 for 44 passes for 206 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions for the Terrapins (4-5, 1-5), who have lost two straight games. Jordan James ran up the middle for a 3-yard touchdown to give Oregon the lead for good, 7-3, with 2:21 to play in the first quarter. The score was set up by a 26-yard pass from Gabriel to James one play after the Ducks converted a fourth-and-1. Oregon made it 14-3 early in the second quarter with a defensive touchdown. Defensive lineman Jordan Burch stripped the ball from Edwards and Brandon Johnson returned the fumble 62 yards. Maryland made it 14-10 on Roman Hemby's 1-yard touchdown run, which capped off a nine-play drive with 3:17 left in the first half. That left enough time for Gabriel to engineer a 12-play, 75-yard drive that culminated with a 9-yard scoring pass to tight end Terrance Ferguson 20 seconds before halftime. Oregon used a fake punt to extend its lead in the third quarter. Facing fourth-and-3 at its own 22-yard line, Burch took the direct snap on a fake punt and rumbled 36 yards.  Five plays later, Gabriel tossed his record-setting touchdown and Josh Conerly Jr. ran in the two-point conversion to make it 29-10. The Terrapins took advantage of several Ducks defensive penalties to sustain drives.

Iamaleava completed 8 of 13 passes for 174 yards but didn't return for the second half after sustaining an upper-body injury late in the second quarter. However, the Volunteers (8-1, 5-1 Southeastern Conference) led 20-7 at the half and weren't truly threatened by the Bulldogs (2-8, 0-6). Sampson collected 149 yards on 30 carries, going over the 1,000-yard mark for the first time in his career. Tennessee rolled up 452 total yards, split almost equally between rushing (240) and passing (212). Freshman quarterback Michael Van Buren Jr. had a rough night for Mississippi State, hitting just 10 of 26 passes for 92 yards with an interception. The Volunteers' defense applied steady pressure, notching four sacks. Tennessee has tied Texas A&M for the SEC lead, a half-game ahead of Texas. The Volunteers can wrap up a spot in the SEC title game next month by winning next week at Georgia and on Nov. 30 at Vanderbilt. Tennessee took a quick 7-0 lead just over three minutes into the game when Iamaleava and Squirrel White hooked up for a 34-yard strike.

Despite Magny entering the fight as the 15th-ranked welterweight, Prates was the sizeable betting favorite. After a few wrestling exchanges, Prates caught Magny with a short left hook, plus a follow-up shot that kept Magny off-balance, leading to the referee stopping the fight at the 4:50 mark of the round. ""Man, I can't explain how happy I am right now,"" Prates said in his post-fight interview. Prates (21-6-0) has four finishes in the UFC this year and is offering to fight Jack Della Maddalena in his next bout.  Magny (29-14-0) has lost his past two fights since beginning the year with a win against Mike Malott at UFC 297 in January. Newly minted UFC middleweight Reinier de Ridder (18-2-0) did not disappoint in his UFC debut, submitting Gerald Meerschaert (37-18-0) by third-round arm triangle in the co-main event. It was de Ridder's 12th submission win of his career.  If any fights fall through, de Ridder requested a quick turnaround at UFC 309, which will be held next Saturday in New York.  A bantamweight fight between Gaston Bolanos (8-4-0) and Cortavious Romious (9-3-0) entertained the limited crowd at the UFC APEX. Bolanos rallied after nearly getting finished in Round 1, using his striking volume to win the fight by unanimous decision. He took the cards 30-26, 30-27, 30-27.

Forsberg and Marchessault each had a power-play goal and Roman Josi recorded two assists for the Predators, who won for just the fifth time in 15 games this season. Four of those victories have come at home for Nashville, which equaled its goal total from the previous three games.  Saros, meanwhile, wasn't tested often, but his most notable save of the night came while almost on his back. He made a desperation catch on Nick Schmaltz's net-front backhander within the game's first three minutes en route to his second shutout of the season.  Connor Ingram stopped 17 of 20 shots for Utah, which was shut out for the second time in three games. Utah is 3-6-3 since winning the opening three games of the franchise's history.  Nashville got a break just 1:11 into the game, when Utah's Alexander Kerfoot was whistled for a trip on Gustav Nyquist. Then less than 1:30 later, Forsberg glided into the circle and snapped the puck past Ingram to open the scoring at 2:37 of the first period.   The power play again came through for the Predators with 8:02 left in the opening period. After Utah killed a five-on-three Nashville advantage, the Predators still had two more minutes left on Olli Maatta's high-sticking penalty. That's when Josi sent a shot toward the net, where Marchessault redirected the puck by Ingram to give Nashville a 2-0 lead.  Utah was outshot 12-4 in the first period, but recorded the first six shots on goal in the second. However, the Predators went up 3-0 when Forsberg got the puck on the near boards, then raced into the Utah zone and eventually beat Ingram with 8:55 remaining in the middle period.  Forsberg failed to score in the previous three games but now has a team-leading eight goals this season.

For the last few games, the Nuggets' reserves have played well, but that hasn't been the case for the Dallas Mavericks. Coach Jason Kidd was critical of his bench after Friday's last-second loss to the Suns, and it's an issue of concern heading into Sunday night's game in Denver. Only two Dallas reserves played significant minutes Friday night -- Spencer Dinwiddie (28) and Dwight Powell (26) -- and the bench combined for just nine points. It has forced Kidd to play stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving more than 40 minutes. ""The fatigue of running Luka and Kyrie 40-something minutes because our bench stinks right now. ... As deep as we are, we've got to get someone to participate off the bench,"" Kidd said. ""Somebody has to join the party to help Kyrie and Luka. That's just not happening right now."" Doncic and Irving are averaging 37.2 and 35.7 minutes, respectively, and are the top two scorers on the team. Injuries have hurt the rotation, as P.J. Washington (knee), Maxi Kleber (hamstring) and Dereck Lively II (shoulder) were all out against the Suns. The injuries and bench aren't the only thing concerning Kidd -- it's his team's slow starts. The Mavericks trailed by 13 at halftime Friday night before rallying to tie it late. ""For whatever reason, we get off to a slow start,"" Kidd said after the game. ""It's got to be addressed. We've talked about it; there's got to be action. Somebody's got to come with some energy. We're flat."" Denver has started slow several times but has rallied to win three of those games. The Nuggets, after an 0-2 start, have won four straight and six of the last seven with strong play from the reserves. The bench didn't score much in the 135-122 win over the Heat on Friday night, but Russell Westbrook had 10 assists and Julian Strawther and Hunter Tyson played solid minutes. Westbrook started the previous three games for Jamal Murray (concussion), but Murray returned Friday to score a season-high 28 points. ""Felt good. Head feels OK. Just happy to be out there and playing with the team again,"" Murray said. Denver is also without starting power forward Aaron Gordon (right calf strain) for multiple weeks, though Peyton Watson has played well in his spot. It helps having Nikola Jokic in the lineup, too. The three-time MVP is making a case for a fourth with his play in the first nine games. Jokic entered Saturday fifth in scoring (28.9 points a game) and first in rebounds (13.2) and assists (11.3), and had his fifth triple-double of the season Friday night. He is the focus of every opponent's defense and finds an open teammate when he is double-teamed. ""Playing with Nikola helps everybody. He puts it in the right spots,"" said Christian Braun, who had 21 points against the Heat. ""You get a lot of easy looks, you get a lot of easy ones early that give you confidence."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Slisz's goal came while Miami defender Tomas Aviles was down on the ground in his own penalty area and his teammates implored referee Lukasz Szpala to stop play. But the laws of the game require referees halt play only if a head injury is suspected, and Aviles clearly grabbed at his leg. As Miami appealed, Atlanta played on, with Pedro Amador providing an outswinging cross from the left and Slisz meeting it to head emphatically past goalkeeper Drake Callender. Jamal Thiare scored a first-half brace for ninth-seeded Atlanta, which needed to win its last two regular season matches just to reach the Eastern Conference wild-card match. From there it triumphed on penalties at CF Montreal, then split the first two games against top-seeded Miami, with each home team winning 2-1, before pulling off Saturday's shocking away victory. Brad Guzan made seven saves to complete a heroic effort across the best-of-three series and help Atlanta advance in an East bracket where all top three seeds were eliminated. Atlanta will visit fourth-seeded Orlando City in an Eastern Conference semifinal after the November international window. Messi and Miami are eliminated after earning an MLS-record 74 points in the regular season to capture the Supporters' Shield and top overall playoff seed. Messi scored a second-half equalizer for Miami, his first goal of the postseason and a rare one through the air after contributing an assist in the series-opening win two weekends ago. Matias Rojas opened the scoring for the Herons in the 17th minute on a rebound after Guzan saved an earlier Messi attempt. But Thiare turned an early deficit into an early lead for Atlanta in the next four minutes. In the 19th minute, he reached Dax McCarty's deflected through ball and hammered a finish past Callender into the top right corner. Two minutes later, Thiare dispatched the finish of Aleksey Miranchuk's clever square pass after McCarty's ball from midfield freed Miranchuk down the right side. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Dougie Hamilton collected the rebound and passed through the neutral zone to Hughes, who descended upon Ilya Sorokin and beat him stick side.  Hughes opened the scoring in the second for the Devils.

The Sixers are desperate for a victory Sunday when they host the Charlotte Hornets, who are seeking their third straight win. Philadelphia (1-7) was expected to contend for a championship behind the dynamic trio of Joel Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey. However, an array of injuries has upended the 76ers. Embiid has yet to play this season due to a knee injury and, most recently, he was given a three-game suspension for shoving a columnist. The former NBA MVP is expected to make his season debut Tuesday when the New York Knicks come to town. George (knee) missed the first five games and is shooting just 41.7 percent overall (and 3 of 16 on 3-pointers) since returning. Then there is Maxey, who injured his hamstring in a loss to the host Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday and will likely miss multiple weeks. At this point, the Sixers are just trying to stay afloat until they get healthy. ""The ship hasn't sunk,"" George said. ""We know that we have to remain positive. We know that big fella is coming back, and he's one of the best. We're going to get Tyrese healthy and we'll get him back. Then we can finally be a complete team and start to build, and then we can finally begin to find out who we are."" In their most recent contest, the Sixers absorbed a 116-106 loss to LeBron James and the host Los Angeles Lakers on Friday. Rookie Jared McCain came off the bench to lead Philadelphia in scoring with 18 points on 6-of-17 shooting, while George and Kelly Oubre Jr. shot a combined 8 of 29 (0 of 10 from deep) and finished with nine points apiece. ""We have some plays there, and it just seems like we don't make them, or we go through a drought shooting the ball,"" 76ers coach Nick Nurse said. ""We have to collectively figure out a way to play better."" The defensive end might be a good place to start. Philadelphia has allowed at least 105 points in all eight of its games -- a trend that might spell bad news against the Hornets' impressive duo of LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller. Ball is averaging 28.4 points and is coming off a 31-point performance in Charlotte's 103-83 win over the visiting Indiana Pacers. He had 17 points in the fourth quarter, matching Indiana's team total, and leads the NBA in fourth-quarter points this season. ""I just think that his overall confidence in himself and his confidence in his teammates just exudes in the fourth quarter,"" Charlotte coach Charles Lee said. ""And I think it just becomes contagious for all of us where we know we've got that guy and he's going to help us all be better."" Miller, who hit a putback at the buzzer Wednesday to be the Detroit Pistons, then scored 29 points on 7-of-11 shooting from long range against Indiana. ""Scary sight,"" Miller said of the Hornets' talented tandem. ""It's definitely going to be scary. LaMelo is that two-way (player) that Coach Charles has been preaching to everybody, and also myself. I think that's a dangerous game to play. His ability to pass the ball on the offensive side and my ability to knock down shots, I think that's a great duo to have in this league."" The Sixers have won 23 of the past 25 meetings with the Hornets, including all four matchups last season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Chris Kreider and Reilly Smith also scored and Adam Fox had two assists in the win. Quick made 37 saves in his third start this season as the Rangers completed a three-game sweep of the season series versus Detroit. The Rangers were coming off a 6-1 home loss to the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday. Red Wings goaltender Ville Husso, who was making his first appearance since opening night, made 20 saves.

The Red Wings entered the contest 31st in penalty killing and that unit gave up the first goal. With Simon Edvinsson in the penalty box for tripping, Fox took a slap shot from the right point that Kreider deflected past Husso. Panarin was credited with the second assist. Detroit had a 19-8 advantage in shots on goal in the second period, yet the Rangers stretched their lead to 3-0. Early in the period, Detroit's Patrick Kane had a shot clang off the post.

But now that the core of the team is gaining experience, Daigneault said it has become easier to prepare for players like Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors. The Thunder and Warriors square off Sunday in Oklahoma City in a battle of two of the top teams in the Western Conference. ""The good news is with our continuity and our growing experience, we're now at the point where we've played against him a lot,"" Daigneault said of Curry. ""There's a cumulative effect to learning the league and learning the game plan over time."" Defending Curry will still be plenty challenging, though.

He has scored 21.0 points per game in his last three games after missing the previous three contests due to a left ankle injury. ""If you blink, he's going to be open and he's going to shoot and make a shot,"" Daigneault said. ""It doesn't make it easier to execute it, but I think our familiarity has increased over time."" For Golden State, Sunday's game is the final in a five-game road trip. The Warriors are 3-1 so far on the trip but are coming off a 136-117 blowout loss on Friday in Cleveland. Golden State trailed that game by 41 points at halftime. ""We gotta respond,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""... We gotta execute better. We had 13 turnovers in the first half. We were completely disorganized. That's where I feel like we need the most work."" It was a rare slip for the Warriors, who entered Saturday ranked second in the NBA in defensive rating, at 106.5 points allowed per 100 possessions. The Thunder are the only team better, at 97.3 points per 100 possessions. Both defenses are also near the top of the league in steals per game, with Oklahoma City averaging an NBA-best 12.9 and Golden State third at 9.8. The Thunder also lead the league with 7.3 blocks per game, while the Warriors average 6.0. Golden State is leading the league with 22.0 points off turnovers per game while the Thunder are tied for fourth at 20.3. Oklahoma City is coming off a 126-107 win over Houston on Friday in the opener of a six-game homestand. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, 26, led the Thunder with 29 points. The seventh-year guard paces Oklahoma City with 26.3 points and 6.4 assists per game. The Thunder are 4-0 at home this season, winning by an average of 17.8 points per game. The biggest difference between the teams is their offensive style. Oklahoma City leads the league in drives per game with 62.1. The Thunder have topped the league in that category in each of the last four seasons.  But though Oklahoma City has attacked the basket regularly, it has drawn just 19.1 free throw attempts per game, the third-fewest in the league. Golden State, meanwhile, averages just 37.3 drives per game, more than just two other teams. The Warriors try 41.1 3-pointers per game, slightly more than the Thunder's 39.2 attempts.  Sunday's game is the first of three between the teams this season. The Thunder won three of four last season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

We've asked him to be aggressive and make the right plays and I think that's what we have to continue to ask from him every night."" Even with Banchero in the lineup, the Magic were having issues on offense. They rank 28th in the NBA in scoring at 106.7 points and are shooting just 44.1 percent from the floor. Jalen Suggs has become the Magic's No. 2 offensive option, averaging 16.3 points this season. But for now, it's all about Wagner shouldering the load. ""Our coaches have done a great job of watching film with him,"" Mosely said. ""Last year, multiple times, he was getting double-teamed and he made the right read, saw the right opening. I think the more he sees it, the more he will recognize it and make the right plays."" The young Wizards have struggled defensively and lost their past three games. They are allowing 123.9 points per game, which ranks second to last in the league. The fewest points the Wizards have allowed this season is 118. The most points Orlando has scored this season is 119. No. 2 overall pick Alex Sarr is averaging just 9.6 points and 6.7 boards and hasn't quite found his groove. Washington has gotten a boost in the past two games from rookie Kyshawn George, who has scored a combined 37 points and made nine threes in that span. ""We've talked about how sometimes you make or miss shots and now he's making the ones he missed,"" Wizards coach Brian Keefe said. ""He's got a good rhythm. He's able to read the game."" ""I know not a lot of rookies have this opportunity to be on the court, number one, and two, have a coaching staff that pushes you to be aggressive,"" George said. ""I think my teammates and my coaches have helped me keep my confidence up."" Jordan Poole is leading the Wizards with 20.7 points per game. One bright spot for Washington has been the play of second-year forward Bilal Coulibaly, who has nearly doubled his scoring output from last season and has raised his shooting percentage from 43.5 to 53.9 percent this season, all while continuing to draw tough defensive assignments. ""That's one of the things we really expect from Bilal,"" Keefe said. ""He has the defensive versatility to guard multiple guys. We're going to continue to do that with him because that's one of his strengths."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

As long as that remains true, the Minnesota Timberwolves superstar plans to keep launching from deep.   Edwards will look to stay hot when the Timberwolves host the Miami Heat on Sunday in Minneapolis. The Timberwolves will try to increase their winning streak to four after victories over the Charlotte Hornets, Chicago Bulls and Portland Trail Blazers. ""I really can't explain it,"" Edwards said of his long-distance prowess. ""I'm not shocked or anything because I work so hard on my trey ball. It's like, ‘Here we go, this is what was supposed to happen.' Hopefully it will keep going that way."" Edwards has been a major part of Minnesota's recent success. He scored 37 points and made 9 of 15 shots from beyond the 3-point arc against Portland, posting those numbers despite resting in the fourth quarter with the Wolves up big.   In nine games this season, Edwards has 50 3-pointers while shooting a career-best 48.1 percent from beyond the arc.   Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said Edwards' shooting has helped the offense hum.   ""It makes the floor huge,"" Finch said. ""He's got great range. He's taking them in the flow of the offense. He's reading the coverages in pick-and-rolls really well right now. He's playing at a high level.""   Meanwhile, Miami is looking for a spark. The Heat have lost three straight against the Sacramento Kings, Phoenix Suns and Denver Nuggets.   Miami is coming off a 135-122 defeat in Denver on Friday night. Tyler Herro led the Heat with 24 points, but Jimmy Butler scored only two points and played only seven minutes before spraining his right ankle. He won't play Sunday.   ""It's always next-man-up mentality,"" Herro said. ""We've dealt with injuries and different guys being out, me being one of them. It's always next-man-up mentality.""   Butler, 35, is averaging 16.1 points, 4.9 assists and 4.8 rebounds this season.   Without Butler, the Heat will look for a better performance on defense. During their losing streak, the Heat have given up 111, 115 and 135 points, respectively.   ""We've got to figure it out,"" Duncan Robinson said. ""This group has got to figure it out. We've got some good stretches defensively. You've got to learn how to win. You've got guys that have done it before. It's just not going to come automatically.""   Minnesota also places an emphasis on defense. A key on that end of the court is Rudy Gobert, who surpassed 9,000 career rebounds in Friday's win.   ""Nine thousand rebounds, it's cool,"" Gobert said. ""It makes me just sit back and realize the journey. ... I'm still on the way. I'm still working every day. We'll see how many I get when it's all over.""   The Timberwolves went 2-0 against the Heat last season. Minnesota won 106-90 at home Oct. 28, 2023, and prevailed 112-108 at Miami on Dec. 18.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

In the fifth and final round of the shootout, Panthers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky made a glove save on Morgan Frost to end the game. It was Bobrovsky's fifth straight win. It was also career victory No. 404, moving him past Grant Fuhr for 12th place on the NHL's all-time list. Florida leads the Eastern Conference with 23 points. Sam Bennett, Nate Schmidt and Dmitry Kulikov scored in regulation for the Panthers, who got two assists from Rodrigues. Bobrovsky, who played his first two NHL seasons for the Flyers (2010-2012), made 34 saves through overtime. The Flyers got goals from Joel Farabee, Anthony Richard and Garnet Hathaway. Scott Laughton added two assists, and goalie Samuel Ersson made 28 saves. Owen Tippett scored in the shootout for Philadelphia. Philadelphia got the first period's only goal. With 4:57 elapsed, Laughton skated from behind the net and won a puck battle with Florida's Uvis Balinskis. Laughton pushed the puck forward to Farabee, who scored on a one-timer from point-blank range. The Panthers came alive in the second period, scoring three of the four goals. First, Rodrigues dished back to the trailer, defenseman Nate Schmidt, who scored on a blistering shot from beyond the top of the left circle. Ersson misplayed that shot as the puck tucked in under his left underarm. The Panthers took a 2-1 lead as Rodrigues worked a give-and-go with Kulikov. For the finish, Rodrigues' lateral cross-ice pass to the slot found Kulikov, who scored off the left post. Philadelphia challenged that goal, believing the puck had gone out of play earlier in the sequence. But that challenge was denied. However, with seven minutes left in the second, Philadelphia pulled its goalie temporarily for an extra attacker on a delayed penalty. That resulted in Richard's goal from the high slot, tying the score 2-2. Bobrovsky, beaten high stick-side, appeared to have been screened on that shot as two Panthers and two Flyers were out in front. Florida regained the lead with 5:04 left in the second as Bennett scored from close range on a one-timer pass from Carter Verhaeghe. Hathaway tied the score 3-3 with 10:13 left in the third as he tried to center the puck. Instead, the puck bounced off of Panthers defenseman Balinskis before squirting in between Bobrovsky's pads. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

But Sunday the Sun Devils go up against the big dogs. Arizona State (2-0) will travel to Spokane, Wash., to face the No. 6 Gonzaga Bulldogs (1-0). ""It was a test,"" ASU coach Bobby Hurley said of beating Santa Clara for his 199th career victory. ""They'll win a lot of games this year. ""It is an older team that has played a lot of games together and brought several guys back. So it was a really good win for us."" Seniors BJ Freeman and Adam Miller led the way for the Sun Devils on Friday, scoring 17 and 16 points, respectively, and combining for five 3-pointers. ASU also got a boost from freshmen Amier Ali (13 points), Joson Sanon (11 points) and Jayden Quaintance (13 rebounds). ""There are a number of guys who can be playmakers and we trust to make the right play,"" Hurley said. ""If we share the ball the right way, good things will happen. Joson got off to a fast start, JQ came through with his rebounding, and Amier made some big shots down the stretch. The freshmen stepped up for us."" The Sun Devils played much better than in their home opener, a 55-48 victory against Idaho State on Tuesday. ""It came down to executing and moving the ball,"" Miller said. ""We have great players, so when we are kicking out and hitting 3s, that's what our team is built off of. We have to continue making the extra pass and getting into the paint."" That will be essential against the Bulldogs, who are coming off a season-opening 101-63 victory against No. 8 Baylor in Spokane on Monday. Nolan Hickman scored 17 points and Graham Ike had 15 points and eight rebounds to lead a balanced Gonzaga attack. The Bulldogs had seven players score nine or more points. ""They just came in and played with great confidence and were very, very assertive,"" Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. ""That's the beauty of this team. We have some nice depth."" The Zags are opening the season with two games against major conference opponents for just the second time in Few's 26 seasons. The last time they did that was in 2020-21, when they beat Kansas and Auburn to open the season and reached 31-0 before falling to Baylor in the NCAA Tournament championship game. ""I'm winless against them, so it definitely is a game you always circle on your calendar when you play against Baylor,"" Gonzaga forward Ben Gregg said. ""Just the history of the program the last 10 years or so. So circled them on our calendar, knew it was the first game. Said before the game we just want to make a statement and we did that."" Perhaps the most impressive thing about Gonzaga's rout was its defense. The Bulldogs held prized Baylor freshman VJ Edgecombe, considered a likely NBA draft lottery pick, to just two points until a highlight-reel dunk over GU's Joe Few, the coach's son, with 1:41 remaining. Edgecombe finished 2-of-11 from the field for four points in 29 minutes.    --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Orlando took the best-of-three series with Charlotte 2-1.  Orlando City were a perfect 4-for-4 in the shootout. Luis Muriel, Kyle Smith, Torres and Rafael Santos all beat Charlotte FC goalkeeper Kristijan Kahlina. Pedro Gallese stopped two of the three Charlotte penalty kicks in the shootout for Orlando.  Orlando was awarded a PK about midway through second-half stoppage time after Djibril Diani pulled down Duncan McGuire in the area. On the ensuing penalty kick, Torres was initially stopped by Kahlina but put in his own rebound to level the score. Karol Swiderski opened the scoring in the 81st minute. He had subbed in in the 61st and put Charlotte FC ahead 1-0 by putting a left-footed strike off a cross from Liel Abada past Gallese. Orlando dominated the first-half possession and had plenty of opportunities to take the lead in the opening 45 minutes.  Three minutes into the match, Torres had a chance in the area but didn't get a clear touch on the ball before Kahlina could grab it. Then, in the 16th minute, Rodrigo Schlegel had an opportunity in the area, heading Martin Ojeda's free kick, but Kahlina was able to make a save. A minute later, Torres' left-footed strike in the area got past Kahlina but hit the post. Torres' strike from the center of the box in the 21st minute also found the woodwork, as Kahlina was able to get his hand on it to deflect it out of harm's way. Charlotte's best chance in the first half came just before stoppage time, as Patrick Agyemang thought he'd opened the scoring in the 45th minute, chipping his strike up and over Gallese, but the play was ruled offside. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Buffaloes (7-2, 5-1 Big 12) racked up 10 tackles for a loss, six sacks, two forced fumbles, an interception and a touchdown.

Per the report, Prescott and the Cowboys are holding off until one more specialist offers an opinion on whether he should undergo surgery. The veteran signal-caller is expected to meet with the specialist early next week in New York. Dallas' medical staff are on board with the surgery, which would keep him off the field for four months. If the specialist agrees with the Cowboys' assessment, Prescott will go under the knife on Wednesday, per the report.   Owner and general manager Jerry Jones told 105.3 The Fan in Dallas on Friday that Prescott would prefer to let the hamstring heal on its own have undergoing multiple surgeries (left shoulder, right thumb, right ankle) over the last few years. Prescott has not been placed on injured reserve, but he will be inactive Sunday when the Cowboys (3-5) try to snap a three-game losing streak against the visiting Philadelphia Eagles (6-2) because of a partial avulsion of his hamstring.

In the first year-ending championship of her career, Gauff captured the Billie Jean King Trophy and the $4,805,000 check -- the largest in the history of women's professional tennis.

Gauff secured her ninth career Hologic WTA Tour singles title in a 3-hour, 4-minute match, the longest final in the WTA Finals since 2008, when time statistics began to be tracked. Gauff, 20, is the youngest player in the title match of the WTA Finals since 2010 (Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki) and is the youngest women's player to win the WTA Finals since Maria Sharapova of Russia at age 17 in 2004.

With the win, Clemson improves to 7-2 and 5-1 in the ACC. They are one of three teams with one loss in the conference behind SMU. Virginia Tech is 5-5 and 3-3 in conference play. After a sloppy first half that saw Klubnik go 8-for-19 in the air, throw an interception at the Hokies' 4-yard line, and take a sack to end another promising drive on fourth down, he showed athleticism and accuracy in the second. Klubnik had two first-down runs on the Tigers' first drive of the second half to keep the chains moving, and connected with speedy wide receiver Cole Turner on a 29-yard pump-and-go for his first score to tie the score at 7. On the next Tigers' drive, facing a third-and-seven, Klubnik evaded Virginia Tech defensive back Mansoor Delane, who came free on a blitz, and found T.J. Moore all alone behind the defense for a 41-yard score to make it 14-7. Clemson cornerback Ashton Hampton would make a brilliant one-armed interception of Virginia Tech quarterback Kyren Drones on the next Hokies' drive and Clemson would march 93 yards on 10 plays with Klubnik connecting with Jake Briningstool for a 12-yard TD pass with 13:08 left. That catch gave Briningstool the most receptions for a tight end in Clemson history. He now has 114. Drones was replaced on the next drive by Collin Schlee, who threw a touchdown pass with 1:43 left. Earlier, the Hokies led 7-0 thanks to a blocked field goal by Keyshawn Burgos that fluttered into the arms of Quentin Reddish, who took it back 77 yards for a score early in the second quarter.

South Carolina's defense did its part, holding Vanderbilt to 274 yards of total offense and a season-low seven points thanks to a dominant performance by its front seven. The Gamecocks sacked Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia (16-of-31 passing, 166 yards, 65 rushing yards) twice, hurried him eight times and broke up eight of his passes. Meanwhile, South Carolina's offensive line had allowed 32 sacks on the season coming into the game, but didn't allow one to the Commodores. It was Vanderbilt's most lopsided defeat this year; previously, the Commodores hadn't lost by more than four points. On the second play of the second half, Sellers escaped the pass rush near his own goal line, rolled left and found a wide-open Jared Brown deep downfield for a 51-yard pass. Two plays later, Sanders found a big hole left and dashed 31 yards for a score and a 14-0 lead. Vanderbilt then sustained its first substantial drive, marching 75 plays in 10 yards and scoring when Pavia broke containment on a pass play and scrambled 17 yards for a touchdown. But Sanders' 39-yard run on the next drive set up his 1-yard scamper to extend the lead back to 14 points. The Commodores moved the ball better in the second half, but the Gamecocks defense stiffened to force turnovers on downs on back-to-back drives. Defensive back Peyton Williams broke up a Pavia pass on the first stop and Bam Martin-Scott broke free on a pass rush to get in Pavia's face and knock down another throw to end the second drive at the Gamecocks 39. After the latter, Sanders took a screen pass from Sellers and weaved his way through defenders for a 43-yard touchdown and a 28-7 lead with 7:55 left. The Gamecocks dominated the first half, out-gaining Vanderbilt 187-83 while steadily pressuring Pavia. Sellers found Nyck Harbor open for 23 yards to the Vanderbilt 17, then hit Josh Simon for a 17-yard touchdown on the next play for the game's first score with 13:11 left in the second quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

After three rounds of penalty kicks where each side converted their shots, the goalkeepers went save for save to keep the shootout going. New York's Matt Freese and Cincinnati's Roman Celentano took turns making saves, with Freese making one more. Chidozie Awaziem of Cincinnati and Andres Perea of NYCFC stepped up in the eighth round but each sent their attempts over the crossbar before Freese made his third and final save on Teenage Habede.

It looked like the two teams that already faced each other five previous times this year in all competitions understood all the other team had planned. Defensively, both teams halted any creativity from the other side, leading to no surprises during the match leading to goals. Luca Orellano had the best chances on goal as the match stayed goalless where the forward had two shots on the goal in the first half. The first came in the 31st minute, when Orellano sent a left-footed shot across the face of goal but Freese dove to make the save. Then, in first-half stoppage time, Orellano dribbled through three defenders, holding possession, and sending a shot towards goal but it went wide right of the post. Orellano was busy offensively, sending in six shots and three on target, more than all of New York City FC who had one shot on target. However, head coach Pat Noonan took Orellano out of the match before penalty kicks after he pulled up and limped late in the match, leading to the visitor's best chance of the night.

The 10th-ranked Wildcats (2-0) stormed out to a 14-2 edge and never let up, flexing their distinct size advantage and using their aggressive defense to quickly turn the game into a rout. Devin Caesar was one of the very few bright spots for the Monarchs (0-2) with 12 points and three rebounds on 5-of-10 shooting. Arizona displayed the formula it hopes can carry it to national title contention this coming season as it begins its first season in the Big 12 Conference. The Wildcats pummeled Old Dominion on the boards, outrebounding the Monarchs 59-28 and out scoring them a staggering 58-24 in the paint. Arizona turned Old Dominion's 18 turnovers into 23 points and opened up a 50-21 lead by halftime. The Wildcats committed only nine turnovers themselves and eclipsed the 100-point mark for the first time this season - something they did seven times last season. Awaka led the effort with a very efficient game at both ends of the floor. Awaka shot 8 of 10 from the field and collected eight offensive rebounds. The inside play complemented Caleb Love on the perimeter as he finished with 10 points, including 2 of 5 from 3-point range and three rebounds. The Wildcats went 8 of 21 from long distance overall. Carter Bryant finished with 12 points and four rebounds while Anthony Dell'Orso had 11 points and four rebounds. Arizona's defense held the Monarchs to just 32 percent shooting and 2 for 16 from 3-point range. The Wildcats racked up numerous trips to the free throw line as well by dominating near the rim. Arizona went 18 of 29 from the foul line while Old Dominion shot only 17 free throws and made six.  The Wildcats will next travel to face Wisconsin on Friday while Old Dominion will play at Radford on Tuesday night. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Braden Sparks had 17 points and eight rebounds to lead the Stags (0-2), who lost 96-58 at Rhode Island on Monday. Jamie Bergens added 12 points and Prophet Johnson paired seven points with six boards. The Hoyas carried a 36-33 lead into the second half and started pulling away by taking advantage of Sorber's size advantage in the paint. Georgetown fed the 6-foot-10 big man near the basket for multiple layups, including back-to-back buckets that pushed the lead to 49-41 with 12:27 to play. Julius Halaifonua's 3-pointer midway through the second half made it 52-43, the Hoyas' largest advantage to that point. Sparks answered with four straight points for Fairfield before the hosts rattled off the next six to take their first double-digit lead at 58-47 with 5:26 to go.

Jets goalie Connor Hellebuyck turned aside 32 shots in the process while setting the franchise shutout streak record to 191:45 of ice time. The Ottawa Senators in 2007-08 won 13 of their first 14 games. Alex Iafallo and Vladislav Namestnikov each had a goal and an assist for Winnipeg. Rasmus Kupari and Nikolaj Ehlers both scored. Cole Perfetti had two helpers, while Neal Pionk, Mark Scheifele and Gabriel Vilardi also chipped in assists. Dallas netminder Jake Oettinger was chased 29:21 into the game after making only 11 saves on 15 shots. He was replaced by Casey DeSmith, who made 10 stops on 10 shots. Iafallo got Winnipeg on the board first 7:28 into the opening frame, finishing off a buzzing man advantage when he chipped the puck into the back of the net following a crisp pass across the crease from Namestnikov. Winnipeg continued to build its lead at the 10:21 mark of the opening stanza when Iafallo created a rebound off Oettinger that trickled onto the stick of Kupari. It took only a quick deke by Kupari to tuck the puck into the open net for 2-0. The offensive onslaught did not stop there. After Namestnikov carved around the back of the net, he stuffed the puck through the glove of Oettinger to give the Jets a 3-0 advantage at 3:34 of the second period. The Jets continued to not give an inch. Ehlers finished off a tight cycle 7:14 into the middle frame from the high slot on the power play to grow his team's lead to 4-0.

The Knicks and Pacers each will look to establish consistency Sunday afternoon, when they meet in Indianapolis in the second game of the season between the longtime Eastern Conference rivals. Both teams were off Saturday following their eventful games Friday, when the host Knicks rolled to a 116-94 win over the Milwaukee Bucks and the visiting Pacers collapsed in the second half of a 103-83 loss to the Charlotte Hornets. The win was the fourth of the season for the new-look Knicks, who overhauled their starting lineup with the offseason additions of Mikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns. It was their third victory by at least 20 points. New York's four losses were by a total of 46 points. Half that collective margin was registered in a season-opening 132-109 loss to the defending NBA champion Boston Celtics. The new and old pieces clicked again in impressive fashion Friday, when the Knicks led the Bucks wire-to-wire. New York pulled off the same achievement in routing the Detroit Pistons 128-98 on Nov. 1. Six Knicks players scored in double figures Friday, when Towns led the Knicks with 32 points and 11 rebounds while Bridges had 17 points. Holdover Josh Hart (11 points, nine rebounds, seven assists) flirted with a triple-double while Jalen Brunson (15 points, nine assists) just missed a double-double.  ""It's going to take time to be cohesive, like we were at the end of the year last year,"" Brunson said of the Knicks, who fell to the Pacers in seven games of last season's Eastern Conference semifinals. ""It's kind of a different team. So for us, we have to continue to gel every single day and keep learning."" The Pacers learned some difficult lessons Friday, when they played a game decided by more than seven points for just the second time this season. Indiana appeared on its way to a decisive victory when it overcame a 10-point first-half deficit and took a 13-point lead by opening the third quarter on a 20-7 run. But the Hornets closed the quarter on a 23-2 run and outscored the Pacers 29-17 in the fourth quarter. Charlotte shot just 37.8 percent from the floor in the first half. The Hornets ended the third by making eight of 11 shots -- including a 5-of-6 performance from beyond the arc -- and shot 56.3 percent (18 of 32) over the final 18 minutes. The Pacers, who opened the third quarter by draining eight of their first nine shots, finished the quarter in a 1-for-10 slump. Indiana missed 11 of its final 12 shots from 3-point range during the Hornets' comeback. Overall, Indiana set season lows in field-goal percentage (39.8 percent) and free-throw percentage (57.1 percent). The 83 points were the fewest for the Pacers since Dec. 12, 2022, when they fell to the Miami Heat 87-82. ""We had a rough shot-taking night on top of everything else and that doesn't help,"" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. ""Being unable to sustain the details that we needed to sustain is the disappointing part."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

McCaffrey missed the first eight games due to Achilles tendinitis in both legs. He was listed as questionable on Friday's injury report. McCaffrey, 28, initially hurt his calf on Aug. 6 and was placed on injured reserve prior to Week 2. But now he's ready to go and 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan is ready to give him the ball. McCaffrey was NFL Offensive Player of the Year last season when he led the NFL with 2,023 yards from scrimmage: a league-leading 1,459 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns plus 67 catches for 564 yards and seven touchdowns.

When Fairleigh Dickinson visits the Bluejays on Sunday afternoon in Omaha, Neb., Kalkbrenner will try to follow his career high 49-point outburst where he set a school record with 20 made field goals in 22 attempts in a 99-86 win Wednesday against Texas Rio Grande Valley. It was a shooting performance that rivals all time NCAA records and the fact that it came from a three-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year winner shows just how well-rounded Kalkbrenner's game has become. The last time a player converted 20 field goals and shot over 90 percent was in 1973, when the late Bill Walton did it at UCLA. The 49 points also broke Doug McDermott's CHI Health Center Omaha arena record of 45 points set in 2014. Kalkbrenner's previous scoring high was 31 points set in the first round of the 2023 NCAA Tournament against North Carolina State. ""We wanted to make a concerted effort to get me established in the post,"" Kalkbrenner said. ""I saw a few go in and kept it going from there. I didn't even realize how much I had. We were in a close game and not executing what we wanted to on defense. I was thinking more about that than what I was doing on offense."" A tight first half led to a two-possession game in the second half as Rio Grande Valley connected on 14 of 35 shots from 3-point range and had 15 offensive rebounds. Creighton coach Greg McDermott said the effort from the scrappy Vaqueros provided plenty of teaching moments the Bluejays will review in a film session and at practice.  ""We'll have a spirited practice to try and get ourselves some better habits on the defensive end,"" McDermott said. ""I'm happy to get the win, but disappointed in what we are doing defensively."" Steven Ashworth added 25 points, on 17-of-17 shooting from the free-throw line, with seven rebounds and seven assists. He was just 3 of 10 from the floor. ""It was incredible,"" McDermott said of Kalkbrenner's performance. ""His teammates did a great job of finding him, of realizing what he had going. He's one of the best players to ever play here and there have been some really good players that have played here."" Last season, Fairleigh Dickinson led the Northeast Conference with 92.0 points per game. The Knights are in search of an offense that is more motion oriented this season and after they dropped their season opener 113-72 at Miami (Fla.) on Monday, they nearly flipped the score with a 112-72 win against Division III Purchase in their home opener Thursday.  Terrence Brown scored a game high 24 points for FDU and Jo'el Emanuel added 16 points.  ""We want to be up tempo and play free,"" FDU coach Jack Castleberry said.

The Mountaineers (1-1), fresh off blowing out an NAIA opponent this week, face Wisconsin on the road at Madison, Wisc. The Badgers (2-0) also have victories over lesser opponents to open the season.   Appalachian State coach Dustin Kerns wasn't as impressed about the score in his team's 108-54 win over St. Andrews of North Carolina on Wednesday as he was with the degree of effort.   ""It doesn't matter your opponent,"" Kerns said. ""You've got to play the right way, have the habits of being unselfish, making tough plays, like Myles Tate diving on a loose ball four times in the first half. That has nothing to do with your opponent.""   In nine minutes on Wednesday, Tate made the only shot he took, a 3-pointer, after netting 21 points in the Mountaineers' season-opening 77-63 loss to Miami (Ohio) on Monday, but he made four steals.   Appalachian State freshman Michael Marcus Jr. racked up 18 points, 10 rebounds and four blocks to lead the win over St. Andrews.   ""I really wanted to see our habits improve -- 23 assists, six turnovers, I thought was really good,"" Kerns said, after his team had 19 giveaways vs. 11 assists in Monday's defeat.   Appalachian State defeated visiting Auburn of the Southeastern Conference 69-64 last season, and edged host Louisville of the Atlantic Coast Conference 61-60 early in the 2022-23 season. The Badgers are the only power conference school on Appalachian State's regular-season schedule.   Wisconsin overpowered visiting Holy Cross 85-61 in its season opener, but not before falling behind by 16 points nearly midway through the first half.   The Badgers were also big favorites at home against Montana State on Thursday and prevailed 79-67, but the Bobcats were within four points for most of the first half before Max Klesmit carried Wisconsin the rest of the way.

It will be the school's fifth game against a power conference opponent since they made the move to Division I for the 2021-22 season, and it might just be their best chance to win. Oklahoma State had to fight tooth and nail to beat coach Doug Gottlieb's Green Bay squad in the Cowboys' season opener on Monday, needing a decisive second half after entering the break only up by a point. They ended up outscoring Green Bay by 12 in the second half for a 13-point victory, but it wasn't exactly the night first-year coach Steve Lutz and the Cowboys were looking for. ""I know that we were great in rebounding, we were great at shooting free throws, we took care of the ball for the most part, but you're not going to be able to play that kind of defense and win in the Big 12,"" Lutz said. ""You're just not. You're kidding yourself if you think that's going to happen."" Senior guard Bryce Thompson led the Cowboys in their win over Green Bay with 22 points on 9-of-13 shooting along with five rebounds. Senior forward Abou Ousmane added 16 points and eight rebounds, while Davonte Davis and Marchelus Avery added 10 points apiece.  Oklahoma State had a 19-3 edge on offensive rebounds and shot 21 of 24 from the charity stripe. The Cowboys had a bit more trouble defensively, allowing Green Bay to shoot 49.0 percent (25 of 41) from the field. St. Thomas' last game also came against Green Bay and surprisingly, they had a more convincing crack at them on Friday. The Tommies got out to a 20-point lead before halftime but took their foot of the gas in the second half, still walking away with a 14-point victory, one point better than Oklahoma State did four days before. Junior guard Miles Barnstable led the charge for the Tommies over Green Bay with a 23-point performance while his backcourt partner Kendall Blue added 17 points. Senior guard Ryan Dufault added 14 points off the bench on 6 of 8 from the field.  The Tommies' win over Green Bay was their second game of the season, as they beat Division III foe North Central (Minn.) by 25 in the season opener. Barnstable led the team in scoring in that game as well with 16 points, bringing his average across the first two games to 19.5. Gottlieb came away impressed with the program St. Thomas coach Johnny Tauer is building. ""We knew how well-coached this team was,"" Gottlieb said. ""(Tauer's) been doing this to people for a long time, and I think our guys respected St. Thomas but we didn't have the disposition. ""They're expertly coached in spacing.

Kaliakmanis completed 17 of 33 passes for 240 yards against the Golden Gophers, for whom he played two seasons, including in 2023 when he threw 14 touchdowns in 12 games. Rutgers improved to 5-4, 2-4 in the Big Ten in snapping a four-game losing streak. Kaliakmanis threw a pair of first-half TDs to Dymere Miller before Rutgers' defense set up the go-ahead score that gave the Scarlet Knights a 23-16 lead. On first-and-16 from the Minnesota 6-yard line, tight end Jameson Geers fumbled when he was hit by Tyreem Powell at the 10 and Shaquan Loyal recovered. Two plays after the fumble, Rutgers' Strong cut up the middle and was left open for an easy TD pass when Minnesota defensive back Ethan Robinson backed off. Following Strong's go-ahead score, the Scarlet Knights increased their lead when Jordan Walker sacked Max Brosmer in the end zone for a safety with 6:53 left, and Jay Patel kicked a 22-yard field goal with 2:45 remaining. Brosmer finished 27 of 45 for 262 yards and Geers had eight catches for 73 yards, but Darius Taylor was held to 28 rushing yards on 10 carries as the Golden Gophers (6-4, 4-3) saw their four-game winning streak stopped. Rutgers earned the win despite missing star running back Kyle Monangai due to undisclosed injury that hampered him in its loss at Southern California two weeks ago. Antwan Raymond replaced Monangai and finished with 73 yards on 22 carries. The Scarlet Knights held a 14-9 lead by halftime thanks to two TDs to Miller. Miller made a diving 1-yard catch with 3:31 left in the first quarter on fourth down for a 7-6 lead. After Minnesota ended the first period with a 9-7 lead on a 51-yard field goal by Dragan Kesich, Miller hauled in a 17-yard TD with 9:54 left in the second quarter. Minnesota regained the lead on its first series of the second half when Brosmer rolled out for a 17-yard pass to Marcus Major with 9:07 left in the third quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Zach Benson and Tage Thompson scored first-period goals for the Sabres, who have won three in a row for the second time this season. Matt Coronato and Mikael Backlund scored goals, MacKenzie Weegar had two assists and Dan Vladar made 17 saves for the Flames, who have lost seven of nine (2-5-2). The Sabres took an early lead after Jacob Bryson's shot from the right point hit the skate of Calgary defenseman Kevin Bahl, redirecting the puck into the slot. Benson was there to backhand the puck into the net for a 1-0 lead at 1:11, his second straight game with a goal. Buffalo went on the first power play of the game when Martin Pospisil flipped the puck over the glass for a delay-of-game penalty. Thompson scored on the ensuing power play with a one-timer from the left circle to make it 2-0 at 13:37. It was the 10th goal of the season for Thompson and the 139th of his Buffalo career, tying him with Jack Eichel for 20th on the all-time list. Rasmus Dahlin earned his 235th career assist on the play to pass Alexei Zhitnik for the third-most assists by a defenseman in Sabres history. The Flames, who have been outscored 17-8 in the first period this season, cut it to 2-1 at 17:44 of the second period. Blake Coleman intercepted an outlet pass in the neutral zone, skated into the Buffalo zone and dropped the puck for Weegar, who carried it into the high slot before taking a shot that was redirected into the net by Coronato for his fifth goal of the season. The Flames tied it 2-2 at 15:42 of the third. Weegar retrieved a blocked shot below the goal line and made a backhand pass out to Backlund in the left circle and he scored with a one-timer, helping the Flames reach overtime for a third straight game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

A 16-point third quarter lifted the Eagles (5-4, 2-3 ACC), who broke a three-game skid in a game of vastly contrasting styles. Anchored by Robichaux (28 carries, 198 yards, two touchdowns) and McDonald (15 carries, 133 yards, one touchdown), Boston College logged 313 of its 378 total yards on 51 rushing attempts. Quarterbacks Thomas Castellanos and Grayson James combined for just 65 yards through the air, but both threw touchdowns. Kyle McCord threw for 392 of Syracuse's 431 total yards during a 31-for-48, two-touchdown performance. Jackson Meeks (105 yards) and Oronde Gadsden II (102) were 100-yard receivers for the Orange (6-3, 3-3). LeQuint Allen scored on a 4-yard run to finish an eight-play drive turning Syracuse's 14-0 deficit into a 21-14 lead with 8:36 left in the third quarter. With James quarterbacking, Robichaux's third run in a 49-second span -- aided by an unnecessary roughness penalty -- tied the score at 21. The go-ahead points came on the next play from scrimmage when Donovan Ezeirauku strip-sacked McCord and knocked the ball through the end zone for the first Boston College safety since 2012. The ensuing drive spanned 12 plays and 67 yards in 6:55, ending with McDonald bouncing to the left for a 13-yard touchdown in the final minute. Syracuse covered 75 yards on its own 10-play drive to start the fourth, moving within 30-28 on McCord's 12-yard pass to Darrell Gill Jr. The Eagles ensured their lead with 6:51 remaining in regulation as James faked a handoff and found a wide-open Jeremiah Franklin for an 18-yard touchdown on fourth-and-1. After Liam Connor missed a 29-yard field-goal attempt on Boston College's opening drive of the game, Quintavious Hutchins recovered Allen's fumble on the following series. The host Eagles scored first on Robichaux's 34-yard run down the right side with 2:43 left in the first. Two series later, the hosts doubled their lead after forcing McCord to throw an incomplete fourth-down pass. Five straight McDonald rushes set up Castellanos for his first completed pass of the game -- a 9-yard touchdown to Lewis Bond. McCord led back-to-back touchdown drives to make it 14-14 at halftime. The Ohio State transfer hit Gadsden for big bookending plays, scoring on a 17-yard pass to the right. After the Eagles went three-and-out, McCord's 25-yard run and a connection with Meeks helped Allen find the end zone on a 3-yard run with 2:10 left before intermission. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The Current advanced to the semifinals where they will face the No. 1 seed Orlando Pride, who earned a 4-1 victory over the Chicago Red Stars in a quarterfinal match Friday. Chawinga, the NWSL's record-breaking goal scorer, returned from a knee injury to score the lone goal of the quarterfinal match. Casey Murphy saved the initial shot by Chawinga and the ball settled at the feet of Vanessa DiBernardo. The midfielder's follow-up shot went off the post and back to the feet of Chawinga, whose first shot was blocked by Kaleigh Kurtz but left a wide-open net on the second attempt. That gives Chawinga 21 goals in NWSL action, adding to an already impressive freshman campaign from the newcomer. North Carolina nearly tied the match in the 32nd minute, when Almuth Schult made a diving save and pinned the ball down with her glove. Manaka Matsukubo ran up and kicked the ball into the net from under the goalkeeper's palm, but the referee blew the whistle because Schult had possession of the ball by holding it against the grass. Kansas City's win featured its offensive firepower, despite the low final score with the Current taking 14 shots in the win and five on target. North Carolina had three saves in goal and three blocks to keep the match close.  In the seventh minute of stoppage time, Chawinga tackled the ball away from Bianca St. Georges and went to the ground. St. Georges responded by standing over the forward.

""I said (to my agent), 'No worries, I'm happy with where I'm at, but it's always nice to know.'"" Day told Code Sports Australia ahead of this month's Australian PGA Championship. ""And they (LIV Golf) said, ‘We love Jason, but he's too injured; he just gets too many injuries.' I don't blame them."" Day won the 2015 PGA Championship and spent 47 consecutive weeks atop the Official World Golf Ranking from 2016-17. However, Day began to suffer from chronic lower back injuries and ultimately dropped as low as 175th in the rankings to begin 2023. The back issues even had him contemplate retirement. The lack of an offer to even consider a move to LIV turned out to be blessing in disguise for Day, who watched fellow Australian Cameron Smith make the jump in the fall of 2022. After working with noted coach Chris Como to revamp his swing, Day finally snapped a five-year winless streak with a victory at last year's Byron Nelson.

Jaylen Brown scored 30 points and Payton Pritchard came off the bench to add 28 points with eight 3-pointers when host Boston beat Milwaukee 119-108 on Oct. 28. The Bucks led 80-79 before the Celtics went on an 18-2 run that began late in the third quarter and extended into the fourth.   Brown's status for Sunday's matchup is uncertain. He has not played in Boston's last four games because of a strained left hip flexor. The Celtics were also without center Luke Kornet during Friday night's 108-104 overtime victory against the Brooklyn Nets because of right hamstring tightness.   ""(They're) day to day, like the rest of us,"" Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said. ""(Brown is) getting better. Getting a little bit better each day. Getting there.""   Damian Lillard led the Bucks with 33 points, seven rebounds and seven assists in the loss to Boston. Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with 30 points, 10 rebounds and six assists.   Milwaukee ended a six-game losing streak by defeating the Utah Jazz 123-100 on Thursday, but dropped a 116-94 decision to the New York Knicks on the road Friday night.  Antetokounmpo had 24 points and 12 rebounds against the Knicks, but was clearly frustrated with Milwaukee's effort level during the loss, which dropped Milwaukee's road record to 1-5.   ""At the end of the day, we've got to compete,"" Antetokounmpo said after Friday's game. ""Teams are not just going to give us games. They're not going to feel bad for us.   ""We've got to compete every single possession. Every loose ball, we've got to get a body on the floor and put it on the line. But we didn't compete at all. ... We've got Boston in two days. We don't compete, we're going to lose by 30.""   Boston's OT victory over Brooklyn on Friday came two days after the Celtics absorbed a 118-112 home loss to the Golden State Warriors. Jayson Tatum collected 33 points and nine rebounds in Friday's win. Pritchard finished with 20 points, including six in overtime.   ""It was kind of one of those ugly, grind-it-out games,"" Mazzulla said. ""We gave up some stuff that we have to get better at, but you had to earn any basket. You had to earn it on both ends of the floor, and I thought we did that, especially toward the end of the game.""   The Celtics shot a season-low 26.4 percent from 3-point territory against Brooklyn (14 of 53). Sam Hauser was 2 of 10 on 3-point attempts, and Derrick White was 1 of 6 from behind the arc.   ""I don't think it's very hard (to maintain confidence), just because we know the type of shooters that we have,"" Boston's Al Horford said. ""We work at this every day, and those are shots that we have to take. ""We had a lot of good looks, and you just have to take them and trust in your process. And I always just think back on our work, on our preparation when we have any kind of ruts like this.""   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

The NWSL's record-breaking goal scorer returned from a knee injury to score the lone goal of the match. Casey Murphy saved the initial shot by Chawinga and the ball settled at the feet of Vanessa DiBernardo. The midfielder's follow-up shot went off the post and back to the feet of Chawinga, whose first shot was blocked by Kaleigh Kurtz but left a wide-open net on the second attempt. That gives Chawinga 21 goals in NWSL action, adding to an already impressive freshman campaign from the newcomer. North Carolina nearly tied the match in the 32nd minute, when Almuth Schult made a diving save and pinned the ball down with her glove. Manaka Matsukubo ran up and kicked the ball into the net from under the goalkeeper's palm, but the referee blew the whistle because Schult had possession of the ball by holding it against the grass. Kansas City's win featured its offensive firepower, despite the low final score with the Current taking 14 shots in the win and five on target. North Carolina had three saves in goal and three blocks to keep the match close.  In the seventh minute of stoppage time, Chawinga tackled the ball away from Bianca St. Georges and went to the ground. St. Georges responded by standing over the forward. Ellis Wheeler ran up behind St. Georges and pushed her to the ground for the gesture, earning a yellow card.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Johnson scored a game-high 18 points and fought through his defender to hoist up a last-second shot that was upheld upon review.   Will Richardson added 11 points for Fordham (1-1), which bounced back from a 32-point defeat to another Big East team, St. John's.   Yacine Toumi scored a team-high 12 points on perfect 5-for-5 shooting for Seton Hall (1-1) before fouling out in the final three minutes.   With Seton Hall struggling through a 2-for-13 shooting stretch, Prince Aligbe scored a driving layup out of a timeout to put the Pirates ahead 55-52, and Seton Hall's Chaunce Jenkins added one free throw with 22 seconds left.   Richardson tossed up a 3-pointer and Aligbe was whistled for a shooting foul, though replay showed he neither touched the defender nor interfered in his landing spot. Richardson made all three foul shots to make it a one-point game.   Seton Hall got the ball in, but Algibe's pass to the baseline glanced off Dylan Addae-Wusu's fingertips and out of bounds with 11 seconds left. Fordham called timeout and drew up the winning play.   Aligbe had 10 points and seven rebounds for the Pirates, who outshot the Rams 40.7 percent to 36.5 percent.   Six quick points from Toumi helped Seton Hall build a 14-7 lead, but Fordham kept it within five for the rest of the first half.   Richardson made his second 3-pointer of the day at the 3:38 mark, but Seton Hall picked up the pace and Addae-Wusu knocked down one of his own nine seconds later to restore a four-point advantage. Godswill Erheriene got a layup to fall in the final seconds to put the Pirates up 32-28 at halftime.   Johnson started the second half 3-for-3 from the field, his back-to-back triples and game-tying layup pulling Fordham level at 38-38.

The Rockets rank among the top 10 in opponents' scoring (108.9 points allowed per game) and defensive field-goal percentage (45.4), yet it didn't look that way Friday when they were blown out by the Oklahoma City Thunder. After trailing by 29 points in the second quarter, the Rockets walked away with a 126-107 defeat. Houston had won four of its previous five games with the lone loss in that stretch coming in overtime last weekend against the Golden State Warriors. ""That's what's disappointing about it,"" Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. ""I felt like we were back on our heels. (Shai) Gilgeous-Alexander and (Chet) Holmgren, and to some extent Jalen Williams, got whatever they wanted a little too easily. Credit to them. They have some good one-on-one players and they beat our one-on-one defense."" Gilgeous-Alexander had 29 points while going 11-for-16 from the field. Holmgren also scored 29 points in 29 minutes and Williams tossed in 14 points while making 7 of 11 shots. Overall, the Rockets watched the Thunder to shoot 51.1 percent from the field and forced just 10 turnovers. ""Our communication wasn't great, also our physicality,"" Rockets center Steven Adams said. ""They were very comfortable out there. So, we need to get up into them. They were being physical with us, and we're kind of just going through like the motions. You're kind of caught like a shootaround, like you're just going through the play."" Houston was outscored 44-20 in the second quarter. ""Couldn't get stops and failed to score,"" Udoka said. ""Minus-24 in that quarter. To give up 44 in a quarter, you've got to at least get it back on the other end and keep it close."" The game on Sunday is the front end of a back-to-back for the Rockets, who have won their last five matchups with the Pistons. They return home to face the Washington Wizards on Monday. Houston has shown a versatile offense with seven players averaging double figures. The Pistons are more reliant on star Cade Cunningham (22.8 points per gam), although they do have four other double-digit scorers among an improved supporting cast this season. Detroit has won three of its last four games and Cunningham carries a streak of three consecutive triple-doubles into Sunday's contest. He had 22 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists in a 122-121 home win over the Atlanta Hawks on Friday. The Pistons led by 24 in the first half, then gave away the lead during crunch time. Cunningham scored the game-winner on a running hook shot with 8.5 seconds remaining, then made a game-saving block to preserve the victory. ""He's the guy. He has the ability to be the guy on an elite basketball team because of all the things he's capable of doing,"" Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""He can manipulate the game. He can score, he makes his teammates better, he rebounds. He's proven that he can defend and make defensive plays as well."" The Pistons were coming off a one-point loss to the Charlotte Hornets that was decided on a last-second tip-in. Cunningham prevented another heartbreaking defeat. ""In spurts, we were awesome,"" Bickerstaff said. ""In other spurts, we were the opposite of that. But the guys stayed together throughout the whole thing and just figured out a way down the stretch to make the plays to win the game. We just made one more play than they did."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Kidd, a 6-foot-10 center who is in his first season with Miami, will lead the host Hurricanes (1-0) in a nonconference game against Binghamton (1-1) on Sunday afternoon. Kidd started all 33 of Virginia Tech's games last season, averaging a career-high 13.2 points while ranking third nationally in shooting percentage (66.8). On Monday, Kidd scored 24 points following a 10-for-11 shooting performance in a 113-72 season-opening win over Fairleigh Dickinson. ""I work on it all the time,"" Kidd said of his shooting. ""When you do something a thousand times, over and over, it's just normal."" Including Kidd, Miami's top five players all started their careers at other schools: guards Nijel Pack (Kansas State) and Jalen Blackmon (Stetson); wing Matthew Cleveland (Florida State) and forward Brandon Johnson (East Carolina). Pack (6-foot) and Blackmon (6-2) are elite scorers, but Miami coach Jim Larranaga worries about their size defensively and on the boards. On the flip side, Pack is a great leader. ""During timeouts, I ask Nijel, ‘What do you want to run,'"" Larranaga said. ""He's our Tom Brady."" As for Cleveland, he missed 17 days of preseason practice due to injury, but he scored nine points in the opener. Last season, he averaged 13.7 points and 6.1 rebounds. Johnson averaged 14.0 points and 8.6 rebounds last season. Meanwhile, Binghamton has been predicted to finish seventh in the 10-team America East Conference after going 15-15, 7-9 last season. The Bearcats are led by Tymu Chenery, their lone returning starter. Chenery, a 6-6 senior guard, averaged a team-high 14.9 points last season. So far this season, he is averaging 11.5 points and a team-high 6.0 rebounds. The team's leading scorer is Ben Callahan-Gold, who played last season for Trinity College, an NCAA Division III school. Callahan-Gold, a 6-8, 220-pound forward, is averaging 13.5 points. Last season, he averaged 16.7 points for 30-2 Trinity. Callahan-Gold scored a game-high 21 points on Thursday in Binghamton's 82-63 win over Oneonta.

We had 15 assists on 27 baskets, so we were moving the ball pretty well, and we could probably move the ball even more and we'll continue to do that as we grow as a team.""

We scored well off turnovers. We had putbacks."" May said Wolf's numbers were impressive, in part, based on the Wolverines' ability to spread out the production.

But Chelsea could be without virtuoso attacker Cole Palmer, who has seven goals and five assists but hasn't trained since he was on the receiving end of Lisandro Martinez's crunching tackle in last weekend's draw with Manchester United.

Bu,"Japanese right-hander Roki Sasaki is set to enter free agency after the Chiba Lotte Marines confirmed his posting process was underway on Saturday. But his posting process, because of his prowess and age, will be more nuanced than others.  Sasaki, 23, is viewed as having one of the top young arms in the world with a 100 mph fastball and deadly sinker.  But barring a change in Nippon Professional Baseball guidelines that limit Sasaki to signing a minor league deal in MLB, he could choose to remain in Japan.  Sasaki indicated in a post to X on Saturday that he's ready to be tested in Major League Baseball, thanking his Japanese team for allowing him to post. If he exits Japan, it would be on a similar timeframe Shohei Ohtani followed when he first entered MLB with the Los Angeles Angels.   ""There were many things that did not go well during my five years with the Marines, but I was able to get to this point by concentrating only on baseball, with the support of my teammates, staff, front office, and fans. I will do my best to work my way up from my minor contract to become the best player in the world, so that I will have no regrets in my one and only baseball career and live up to the expectations of everyone who has supported me."" By waiting until he's entering his age 25 season in 2026, Sasaki could've been in position to cash in with an enormous initial contract like the one Yoshinobu Yamamoto signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers for 12 years and $325 million last December. In Sasaki's case, the Chiba Lotte Marines can claim 20 percent of Sasaki's contract. International bonus pools are hard-capped near $7 million per team.  Teams are allowed to trade for bonus pool money to increase the amount they can pay international players on minor-league deals, but most enter free agency sitting on between $4 million and $6.5 million total. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Waring's 54-hole total of 18-under is good enough to take a one-shot lead into the final round at Yas Links, with Niklas Norgaard of Denmark right behind him at 17-under par following a round of 69.  Tommy Fleetwood (71) of England, Shane Lowry (66) of Ireland, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen (71) and Sweden's Sebastian Soderberg (68) are tied for third at 15-under. Waring, an Englishman, can blame his 73 on his putter. After a birdie on the second hole, he had 8 feet remaining for a birdie on the par-3 fourth hole and wound up with a bogey. He then missed birdie chances on the next nine holes before another bogey on No. 14. ""I'm a little bit disappointed. I felt like I could have put myself out of sight but four rounds of golf, you're always going to have a bit of an iffy run of holes, an iffy round of golf,"" he said. ""If beginning of the week you had given me a one-shot lead going into tomorrow, I'd have snapped your hand off. ""I'm trying to remain positive that I'm still in the lead, looking forward to getting out there tomorrow."" Six golfers are tied for seventh place at 14-under, including Belgium's Thomas Detry, who shot a career-low 62 on the DP World Tour on a 10-birdie round. His primary goal for the week is to climb into the top 50 to move on in The Race to Dubai; he entered the week No. 63 in the standings. He shot 72 and 68 in the first two rounds. ""It's been a tale of three different days; I finished horrendously on Thursday, played much better yesterday and today was just kind of everything clicked together. ""I just played really well. Didn't really miss any drivers. Pretty wide fairways out here, but I kept myself in position the whole round and obviously made a couple of great putts on my first few holes to get the momentum going and I kept going."" Northern Ireland's Rory McIlory, the Race to Dubai leader, sits at 13-under in a four-way tie for 13th place. He finished with a 69, but a bogey at No. 1 and a double bogey at No. 18, spoiled what could have been a stellar round. Waring likely will need another terrific round to win Sunday, and he acknowledged he will need to control his emotions. ""I wasn't at my best today, felt a little bit jittery in total honesty, I felt the greens were a foot-and-a-half quicker, they were breaking a bit more than what I was reading. I just struggled on them a little bit today."" He continued: ""It's a game of golf tomorrow in the sunshine -- I'm looking forward to the challenge of it now. I feel like my bad golf is out of the way now."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",

Olave has been ruled out for Sunday's game against the visiting Atlanta Falcons after sustaining his second concussion of the season last week versus the Carolina Panthers. He will miss at least the team's next four games as a result of the move. The injury occurred as Olave attempted to catch a pass from quarterback Derek Carr on the play at the 7:03 mark of the first quarter. As the ball sailed over Olave's head, he was sandwiched between two Carolina defenders and crumpled to the ground. Olave, 24, also was removed from the Saints' game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Oct. 13 with a concussion. He has 32 catches for 400 yards and a touchdown in eight games this season. Olave was selected 11th overall by the Saints in the 2022 NFL Draft. He began his career with back-to-back 1,000-yard receiving seasons.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024",
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",College Football's Most Overpaid Coaches Based on Results,https://deadspin.com/college-footballs-most-overpaid-coaches-based-on-results/,2024-11-09T15:25:43.499Z,"There's bad coaches all across America, but these are the most overpaid coaches in college football based on their poor results compared to massive sa","When the University of Florida made Steve Spurrier the highest-paid coach in college football history—and the game’s first million-dollar man—in 1996, there was an air of scandal surrounding the news. One million dollars? In college sports? It feels downright quaint when revisited in this era. Top-strength coaches are now joining the seven-figure club. Referencing USA Today’s database of coaching salaries, most recently updated in October 2024, 92 FBS coaches earn at least $1 million annually. Certainly, inflation from 30 years ago is a factor, but if only all professions’ pay scales swelled at the rate of coaching salaries... With that in mind, it’s not unfair to evaluate coaching tenures relative to their sizable bank accounts. Using USA Today’s findings, the following quartet stands out for delivering results that fall short of their wages. A notable omission is Penn State’s James Franklin. Franklin’s 1-10 all-time record against Ohio State is certainly a sore spot among the Nittany Lions fan base, as is the program’s inability to break through to a College Football Playoff appearance. However, the Nittany Lions have consistently finished seasons ranked in the top 10. With Franklin’s $8.5 million salary ranked as the 13th-most lucrative among coaches, Penn State’s results typically meet or exceed its coach’s paycheck. Starting with the 77th-highest paid coach in the sport may seem like an odd choice. But then, UAB hiring Trent Dilfer was an odd choice in itself, and his brief tenure has almost immediately unraveled the remarkable work of his predecessor, Bill Clark. Clark transformed the regular cellar-dweller program, which had been literally shut down early into his tenure, into a perennial bowl participant. Dilfer took over with four years of high school coaching experience at Tennessee-based Lipscomb Academy, and the Blazers immediately began to struggle. They went 4-8 last season and are 2-6 through eight games in 2024, with an average margin of defeat of 25.7 points per game. At $1.5 million per year, Dilfer is paid more than in-state counterpart Rich Rodriguez, who has won 14 games in less than two seasons at Jacksonville State. Dilfer’s UAB team also suffered a humiliating defeat this season at the hands of ULM, coached by Bryant Vincent, a former Clark assistant passed over for the Blazers job. Vincent is paid $900,000 less per year than Dilfer. As the first program ever to pay its head coach $1 million, Florida obviously takes its investment in football seriously. Those in Gainesville responsible for making such decisions also demand immediate and consistent ROI. Just ask Jim McElwain and Dan Mullen, both of whom were fired within two years of reaching an SEC Championship Game. So, with third-year Gators coach Billy Napier sporting an underwhelming 15-18 record in his tenure and headed for a possible third straight sub-.500 finish, it stands to reason that Napier was on the hot seat. His $7.37 million per year contract, ranked No. 21 in college football, is relatively modest compared to the rest of the SEC—and perhaps reflective of the massive buyout money that the program’s impatience has cost it. Mullen’s buyout came with a $12 million price tag, which Florida is paying through 2027. McElwain’s buyout totaled $7.5 million, the same rate UF initially balked at paying to Colorado State in order to hire him away from Fort Collins. One massive reason he’s back for 2025: Napier’s buyout is staggering $26.7 million. In the roughly 15 years since the end of the Pete Carroll dynasty at USC, Trojans faithful have offered no shortage of explanations as to why the program has not been able to recapture its dominance of the 2000s. NCAA sanctions in the wake of the Reggie Bush scandal—which wouldn’t even violate today’s rules—were overly punitive. The Pac-12 Conference was holding USC back. The investment in coaching salaries wasn’t competitive with the top of college football. Well, it’s been a decade since the Bush scandal sanctions lapsed. The Trojans are now members of the Big Ten, and at more than $10 million per year, Lincoln Riley is the fourth-highest paid coach in the sport and tops in the Big Ten. A promising start in 2022, with USC going 11-1 in the regular season, seemed to justify the hefty contract. Since then, however, USC has posted a combined 12-12 record, with a disappointing finish to 2022, an 8-5 record in 2023 that felt like a retread of the Clay Helton years, and a 2-5 start in 2024. The Trojans have lost to three Big Ten teams with .500 or worse league records (Washington, Michigan, and Maryland). The inclusion of Stoops, who in 2022 became Kentucky’s all-time wins leader, is tenuous. Winning with consistency at what is a firmly established basketball school is never easy—just look at the track records of Duke, Kansas, UConn, or Arizona football programs. Look, too, at Stoops’ Kentucky predecessors, most of whom have seen far more success during his tenure. Bear Bryant and his successor, Blanton Collier, are the only other Wildcats coaches post-World War II to have above-.500 records at UK. Stoops is also the ninth-highest paid head coach in the sport, making just over $9 million a year. Kentucky has finished ranked in the end-of-season Top 25 just twice during Stoops’ tenure—the most recent time, in 2021, it had its 10 wins vacated. Measured against the history of Kentucky football, Stoops is an undeniable success. However, measured against his $9 million salary, Stoops is the least accomplished among the sport’s 10 highest-paid coaches. Copyright 2024",

If you watched Florida strike fear in the Bulldogs and paid too close attention in the first half of Georgia at Alabama, we understand your trepidation in putting your toes in the water on this one. The Bulldogs (7-1, 5-1 SEC) are looking to strengthen their bid for a fourth straight conference championship game appearance and are in the top three of the initial CFP rankings for the fourth year in a row. A newer guest to the party, Ole Miss (7-2, 3-2) has appeared in four consecutive initial CFP rankings as well. But finishing in the SEC with a strong November is a steep climb. And the timing is not good for the Rebels because of injuries. Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart knows that all too well. He was mortal in the Ole Miss loss at Georgia last season. Dart is first in the nation with 3,210 passing yards and a 192.4 passing efficiency rating. He has 21 touchdowns to just three interceptions. He’s eager to get another shot at Georgia after the 52-17 loss to the Bulldogs last season. The Rebels were 8-1 going into that game.But he’s not equipped to deal with the Georgia defense that dominated at Texas and shows well on the road. Bet: Georgia -3 (-115 DraftKings) $100,000 Daily Race Sign up now to claim For help with a gambling problem, call or text the NCPG - (1-800-522-4700)  First Bet Safety Net $1000 or Bet $5 & Get $150 Sign up now and get the choice of two incredible offers.

FC Barcelona announced the new “multi-year partnership agreement” on their website on Saturday, November 9. The club said the deal “brings a new collaborative strategic partnership model between the two organizations.” This new partnership consolidates Nike as a Main Partner of the Club and Official Technical Partner across all professional and amateur teams, bringing a unique model that strengthens the brands association and fuels the global retail and licensing business growth. Nike has a key strategic role in the Club’s Retail Operations and together with Barça Licensing & Merchandising will join forces in the development of specific plans related to product creation, supply chain and global distribution.   Nike has outfitted Barça since 1998. Since then, Barça’s men’s first team has won four Champions League titles, 12 La Liga titles, seven Copas del Rey, three World Club Cups and three European Super Cups wearing Nike uniforms, while the women’s first team has won nine league titles, three UEFA Women’s Champions League titles and nine Copas de la Reina in that time. The terms of the deal between Barça and Nike were not disclosed in Saturday’s announcement, but ESPN reports “the deal will total significantly more than €100 million ($107m) per year, but that the agreement is incremental and that the total amount is also dependent on certain add-ons.” They also report that Barça president Joan Laporte has previously claimed it would be the biggest deal of its kind in world soccer. According to Mundo Deportivo, Barça will receive €1.7 billion over 14 years, or about €121 million per year. It also includes a signing bonus of €158 million, which will also be spread over the 14 years of the contract. Mundo Deportivo also reports that Barça was allowed to field offers from other companies, and they did receive a proposal from German sportswear brand Puma, which Nike then matched. The previous contract between Nike and Barça was set to expire in 2024. There was some friction between the two sides earlier this year, with Footy Headlines reporting in July that a Spanish court had blocked Barça’s attempted to end their contract early. They also reported that retailers were having a hard time ordering Barcelona products from Nike, and Barça’s 2024-25 third kit celebrating women’s sport was released about three weeks later than similar third kits for other high-profile clubs outfitted by Nike.",

After the 1999 season, the team moved 20 miles east to the town of Kodak, where they played from 2000 to 2024 as the Tennessee Smokies.

New look from a familiar era. Get your City Edition Jersey 11.14.24 pic.twitter.com/svaZdznsxa The white uniforms feature a slanted “H-Town” wordmark across the chest that is inspired by the uniforms worn by Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler during those championships seasons, particularly the lowercase “t.” The red and blue striping pattern on the collar, shoulders, sides of the jerseys and – most notably – around the shorts mirrors the shape and trimming of the Rockets’ championship banners, which hang in the rafters at Toyota Center. The logo on the side of the shorts matches the center-court logo at The Summit, Houston’s home from 1975-2003. It was where the Rockets clinched their titles with a Game 7 victory over the New York Knicks in 1994 and a sweep of the Orlando Magic in 1995. The logo matches Houston’s primary logo at the time, but also includes a “Summit” wordmark at the bottom. The Summit’s logo – which is reminiscent of the Portland Trail Blazers’ logo – can also be seen in gold on the waistband of the shorts, matching the Nike swoosh on the shoulder and hip. The uniforms are complete with Olajuwon and Drexler’s signatures and a “Believe It! Again!” wordmark, which is a nod to the team’s rally cry during their second title run, above the jock tag. This marks the second straight year the Hall of Famers’ signatures are included in Houston’s City Edition design. The Rockets will wear their new City Edition uniforms 13 times this season, including against the Indiana Pacers on Nov. 20, Blazers on Nov. 23, Minnesota Timberwolves on Dec. 27, Los Angeles Lakers on Jan. 5, Phoenix Suns on Feb. 13, Golden State Warriors on Feb. 13, Milwaukee Bucks on Feb. 25, San Antonio Spurs on Feb. 26, Magic on March 10, Suns on March 12, Philadelphia 76ers on March 17, Denver Nuggets on March 23 and Oklahoma City Thunder on April 4.",

The Rangers unveiled the jerseys on their website and social media accounts on Friday, November 8, making this the 19th straight season the team has produced a Remembrance Day jersey. This year’s edition commemorates the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Normandy — better known as D-Day — which took place on June 6, 1944. The base of the jersey is royal blue, with grey, red and white stripes around each sleeve and the waist. The front of the jersey features a shield “based on imagery of soldiers entering the battle on the beaches of Normandy,” according to the Rangers’ website. Above the blue soldier rushing off a landing craft is the inscription “1944-2024”, while three red maple leaves swirl around the soldier. The 1944 Battle of Normandy was one of the pivotal events of the Second World War and the scene of some of Canada’s greatest feats of arms. Canadian sailors, soldiers and airmen played a critical role in the Allied invasion of Normandy, also called Operation Overlord, beginning the bloody campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi occupation. Nearly 150,000 Allied troops landed or parachuted into the invasion area on D-Day, including 14,000 Canadians at Juno Beach. The Royal Canadian Navy contributed 124 vessels and 10,000 sailors and the Royal Canadian Air Force contributed 39 squadrons to the operation. Total Allied casualties on D-Day reached more than 10,000, including 1,096 Canadians, of whom 381 were killed in action. By the end of the Battle of Normandy, the Allies had suffered 209,000 casualties, including more than 18,700 Canadians. Over 5,000 Canadian soldiers died. A poppy sits on the left chest of the jersey as a symbol of remembrance honoring armed forces personnel who have died in conflict. The left shoulder has a “D-DAY 80” logo while the Rangers’ primary logo sits on the right shoulder. The jersey was pictured with blue pants, gloves and helmets in photos released with Friday’s announcement. The socks are also blue with the same striping as found on the sleeves. The Rangers will wear their Remembrance Day jerseys tonight (Friday, November 8) when they host the Soo Greyhounds at the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium. It’s their only home game this Remembrance Day weekend, as they visit the Owen Sound Attack on Saturday and the Oshawa Generals on Sunday. Rangers fans can purchase game-worn Remembrance Day jerseys through a silent auction that will run throughout Friday’s game. Five of the jerseys will also be available for auction online through DASH. Proceeds from both auctions will benefit the 78th Fraser Highlanders Fort Conestoga Garrison and the Kitchener-Waterloo Poppy Fund.",

The Moose unveiled the jersey on their website and social media channels on Thursday, November 7, and they’ll wear them on the ice for the first time on Saturday, November 23, when they host the Chicago Wolves. The focal point of the jerseys is the team’s classic “Happy Moose” logo, which appears on the front of the jersey recolored in the team’s current color palette. The Moose used a green and purple version of this logo when they were members of the International Hockey League from 1996 to 2001, and then a green and black version from 2001, when they moved to the AHL, until 2005. In 2011, the Winnipeg Jets brought NHL hockey back to the city, meaning the Moose moved to St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, where they were renamed the St. John’s IceCaps. But in 2015, the team moved back to Winnipeg and the Moose name and logo were revived, but the logo was recolored to match the Jets’ palette. The base of the 25th season celebration jersey is bright blue, with a navy blue collar and shoulder yoke. Navy blue, silver and white stripes run around each sleeve and the waist. The front of the jersey also includes a “25 SEASONS” patch with a map of Manitoba on the left chest. The Jets’ logo appears on the left shoulder, while an “MM” monogram appears on the right shoulder. “EST. 1996” is printed inside the collar. The numbers on the sleeves and back match those found on the Moose’s regular jerseys, with moose antlers built into the numerals. Along with the jerseys, the Moose also launched a line of 25th season merchandise on their online shop Thursday. This line includes hoodies, sweatshirts, caps, pucks and pins. The Moose will wear the 25th season celebration jerseys four times during the 2024-25 AHL regular season. At each of these games, the first 1,000 fans will receive one of four collector pins featuring either one of the team’s primary logos from past 25 years or the team’s 25th season logo.

The PWHL launched new jersey designs for all six of its clubs on Thursday, November 7, all manufactured by Bauer. The league’s press release from the league focused heavily on the dark jerseys that will be worn for home games, but light away jerseys — either white or off-white — were also included in some teams’ social media posts. After teams played the 2024 season using just their geographic names, the PWHL unveiled team names and logos in early September. The teams retained the primary colours they wore during the PWHL’s inaugural season, though some added additional colours. “Players and fans alike have been waiting for this moment and we couldn’t be happier with the six unique looks each team will don moving forward,” said Amy Scheer, PWHL Senior Vice President of Business Operations, on the league’s website. “These jerseys mark the latest evolution in our league’s history, and we can’t wait to see them showcased both on the ice and in the stands.”  Each team will have contrasting shoulder yokes, with the PWHL logo on the right shoulder and space for advertising patches on the left shoulder and right chest. Each team also has an insert at the front of the collar with the PWHL logo inside. Teams will all use the same block number font, but each will have small team-specific icons in the numbers. Each jersey incorporates elements that embody the spirit of the team, all while supporting athletes on the ice with advanced materials and construction. Through a series of design sessions, unique elements such as stripe size, number style, and the crest were meticulously developed to enhance their identities. Crafted from breathable and durable fabrics, these jerseys are engineered to withstand intense physical play and offer a tailored fit for maximum mobility, comfort, and aesthetic appeal. The PWHL worked closely with Creative Agency Flower Shop in creating the jersey designs as part of the overall team brand identity work.  The jersey design process was led by PWHL Vice President of Brand and Marketing Kanan Bhatt-Shah and done in collaboration with New York-based creative agency Flower Shop, which also worked on the team names and logos. Here’s a closer look at the new jerseys and what the league had to say about them in Thursday’s announcement: Anchored by the team’s signature “B” across the chest, the Fleet’s home jersey features a deep green base, complemented by oceanic blue accents on the shoulders, sleeve stripes, and waist. The classic hockey design incorporates alternating bands of color, forming a wave-like pattern that evokes a strong connection to the sea. The numbers on Boston’s jersey carry a unique wave motif inspired by the crest, further reinforcing its maritime heritage.  The Frost’s home jersey embraces the chill with a deep purple base that channels the spirit of Minnesota winters. White accents on the shoulders, arms, and waist add a crisp, icy contrast, capturing the sharpness of the frozen landscape. Light purple details introduce a modern touch, blending seamlessly to create a layered, frosted look that embodies both the intensity and elegance of the Frost on the ice. The jersey numbers feature a motif inspired by the shape of the team’s crest, bringing a distinct edge to the design.  Anchored by the burgundy base, the Victoire’s home jersey reflects Montréal’s timeless elegance and strength. The navy shoulders and dynamic sleeve design draw inspiration from the angular lines of the team’s crest, adding a sense of movement and precision. A bright blue stripe accents the overall design, providing a vivid contrast while maintaining a classic style that honors the heritage of both the city and team. The jersey numbers are adorned with a Fleur-de-lys motif, reinforcing Montréal’s cultural pride.  Inspired by the hexagonal shape of their team crest, the Sirens’ home jersey captures the spirit of New York’s multifaceted energy. Angular sleeve stripes, echoing the crest’s geometric form, combine the city’s signature navy, orange, and grey hues, creating a striking, modern motif. The lower waist reflects the same hexagonal pattern, grounding the design in New York’s intense and dynamic identity. The numbers on New York’s jersey feature linework inspired by sound vibrations, echoing the city’s constant hum and buzz.  The Charge’s home jersey energizes the ice with its vibrant red base, embodying Ottawa’s unyielding drive. Dark and light grey bands run across the sleeves and waist, adding depth and a sense of momentum, while a bold pop of electric yellow pulses through the design. The overall look captures the energy and intensity that defines the Charge’s fierce presence on the ice. Custom numbers on the jersey incorporate small electrical charges, adding a spark to the back of the jersey.  The Sceptres’ home jersey reflects a modern, confident Toronto, with a rich blue base that captures the city’s leadership and pride. Navy paneling along the sleeves and waist brings depth and contrast, while clean, precise yellow lines and a matching collar add sharp, dynamic details. The striking gold and yellow of the team crest stands out, creating a look with bold presence, embodying the energy and spirit of Toronto fans. Custom numbers nod to the Sceptres’ crest design. Last season, the PWHL ran a pilot project during which Molson Breweries paid to place its logo on the upper back of jerseys, allowing nameplates to be placed under the numbers where they wouldn’t be covered by players’ long hair. Based on the photos released with Thursday’s announcement, it appears this pilot project will not continue in the upcoming season. PWHL home jerseys are available to buy now on the league’s official online shop. They’ll be available through Bauer’s website and key retailers starting on Thursday, November 14. The 2024-25 PWHL regular season begins on Saturday, November 30, when the Boston Fleet visit the Toronto Sceptres at the Coca-Cola Coliseum at 2 p.m. ET. Later that same day is an all-Canadian matchup between the Ottawa Charge and the Victoire de Montréal at Place Bell in Laval, Quebec. The defending champion Minnesota Frost open their season on Sunday, December 1, when they host the New York Sirens at the Xcel Energy Center.",

The Crows launched the new logo on their website and social media channels on Wednesday, November 6. It depicts the full body of a navy blue swooping crow — a throwback to previous logos in the club’s history and a stark contrast to the most recent iteration of their logo, which only depicted a crow’s head — with a gold outline, red and gold streaks in the wings and a red eye. The angles of the logo are sharper than the previous version, and the color scheme returns to the club’s “original bolder colors,” including a darker shade of navy blue, a “richer” red and a “deeper” gold. The logo is a celebration of the Club being born from the state’s thriving football landscape in 1990, with the wing of the Crow emanating from the actual shape of South Australia. In a further change, the word ‘Adelaide’ now solely sits below the crow and reinforces the connection between the Club, the city and state.  The new Crows logo was developed in partnership with Fuller Brand Communication, a creative agency based in South Australia. The process involved “widespread consultation with members, supporters and focus groups, such as the Member Engagement Panel.” The Crows’ logo was last revamped in 2010. Their first crest upon joining the AFL in 1991 featured a crow with swooping red, yellow and blue lines behind it inside a white shield with a red outline; “ADELAIDE” and “CROWS” were written out above the crow in yellow on a navy background. In 1996, the writing was changed to emphasize the city name. Then, from 1999-2009, the club ditched the shield and used the crow with the swooping lines behind on its own, with the team name in navy underneath. “The logo is one of the Club’s most recognisable features and our supporters take great pride in it, and the throwback to the original swooping Crow reinforces our connection to this city and state by the way it now incorporates the actual shape of South Australia,” said Crows CEO Tim Silvers on the team’s website. “We also wanted to make sure we celebrated our heritage but with a modern look and feel, which we think will resonate with our next generation of supporters. We’ve consulted and listened to a wide range of stakeholders, including and most importantly sections of our supporter base, over the past 18 months.  “Now is the perfect time to make this change as our new headquarters at Thebarton Oval is moving closer and closer to reality, so it really is the start of a new era.”  New guernseys were not unveiled as part of Wednesday’s announcement. But merchandise with the new logo is already available on the Crows’ official website and at the team shop in the Adelaide suburb of West Lakes. The Crows are the first of three teams who were reported to be unveiling new logos this offseason to do so. The other two teams named in an article on the AFL website in August are St. Kilda Football Club and Gold Coast Suns.",

Napoli unveiled the new kits on Saturday, November 2, and wore them the following day in a match at home against Atalanta. The predominantly dark grey kit is inspired by Japanese culture and the twinning of Naples and Kagoshima, Japan, which have been sister cities since 1960. The tonal pattern on the kit is a mixture of Japanese and Italian artistic styles. It includes several Samurai objects — including the kabuto (helmet), the menpo (mask) and the katana sword — while melding a Japanese wave motif with a Neopolitan baroque style. Down the right side of the shirt are Japanese characters representing the seven Bushido virtues that are the principles of the Samurai: righteousness, respect, courage, honor, compassion, honesty and loyalty. Despite being so far away from each other, the twinning of the two ports is a symbol of their affinity and the unique characteristics that they share, from the gulfs to the volcanos that dominate the landscape: Vesuvius in Naples and Sakurajima in Kagoshima. The friendship between the two cities has led both of them to dedicate street names to each other: “Napoli-dori” (Naples street) in Kagoshima and “Via Kagoshima” in Naples. The collar, side panels and sleeve cuffs feature black trim, while the Napoli crest and sponsor logos on the chest are light blue. The kit was designed in collaboration with the Ten Shin – Cuore di Cielo Puro Soto Zen Temple in Naples and the Samurai Academy Naples. “The third kit perfectly places itself at the heart of our project ‘From Napoli to the World,’” said Tommaso Bianchini, the club’s chief revenue officer. “Starting in Naples, we arrive at the Japanese city of Kagoshima to tell the story of the relationship between these two distant cultures that are linked by a warrior’s spirit. With this shirt, we celebrate strength, respect and loyalty, which are values that we proudly bring onto the pitch.” Napoli’s next Serie A match is on Sunday, November 10, when they travel to the San Siro to face defending champions Inter Milan.",

The wordmark and number font on the off-white uniforms matches the signage seen around the United Center, including gate and seat numbers, while the overall color scheme was based on the exterior of the building, with shades of brown, gray and white.  Details steeped in history.@MotorolaUS | https://t.co/PqhESWUXtq pic.twitter.com/ZyZc75upU7 The design across the shoulders and down the sides of the shorts are supposed to mimic in-arena lights during the Bulls’ starting lineup introductions, while the logo on the waistband pulls inspiration from the windows near the top of the United Center’s walls. The uniforms are complete with the Bulls’ iconic diamond-shaped shorts design and a uniquely shaped logo above the jock tag on the jersey, which pays homage to the original marquee that stood outside of the arena and read “Home of The Bulls.” Chicago will wear its new City Edition uniforms eight times this season, including games against the Memphis Grizzlies on Nov. 23, Boston Celtics n Dec. 21, Milwaukee Bucks on Dec. 28, New York Knicks on Jan. 4, Philadelphia 76ers on Jan. 25, Golden State Warriors on Feb. 8, Phoenix Suns on Feb. 22 and Dallas Mavericks on March 29. The Bulls’ 2023-24 City Edition uniforms, meanwhile, were inspired by the old Chicago Stadium, which stood on the Near West Side for nearly 60 years before it was replaced by the United Center in 1994 and was affectionally referred to as the “Madhouse on Madison.”",

The club officially announced today that they are now known simply as Athletics. The new location-less name will stick for as long as the team plays in Sacramento, which looks like it will be for the next three seasons before they move to Las Vegas, where *I assume* they’ll be known as the Las Vegas Athletics. Once they take the field, this will be the first time in North America’s “Big Four” major sports leagues that a team has officially played a game without a location name in 80 years. The closest we saw to this in recent times was when the Anaheim Angels became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and spent the next decade referring to themselves only as the Angels in just about everything aside from their preferred abbreviation, “LAA.” There’s really no obvious reason for the Athletics to go this route. The team already owns the trademarks for both Sacramento Athletics and Sacramento A’s. They could’ve proceeded just as the Angels did previously and reserved the use of Sacramento for standings and scoreboards while sticking to “Athletics” on their uniforms and all official releases. Along with the official name change came the official primary logo the Athletics will use while playing in Sacramento. There’s no surprise here; they’ll use just the “A’s” portion of Oakland’s logo, removing the green circle and the team name. Club officials had previously revealed the team’s uniforms would remain largely the same when they shifted to Sacramento, with all the “Oakland” logos replaced with “Athletics.” This would mean changes only to their road greys and Kelly green alternate jerseys. According to a post from @EvanDrellich on Twitter, the Athletics request the following: The club should be referred to only as “Athletics,” with the shorthand “A’s” allowed only after they’ve already been called Athletics. The team abbreviation will now be “ATH,” so you’ll see this on the TV scoreboards instead of “OAK” going forward. The A’s also do *not* play in Sacramento (my bad); they play in *West* Sacramento (maybe this is why they didn’t go with Sacramento Athletics?). They also mentioned the change, as I discussed earlier, to their primary logo. The name change has already been reflected in the club’s online presence. The team is now listed second alphabetically between Arizona and Atlanta, appearing only as “Athletics” on MLB.com’s team selection list as well as their online shop at MLBShop.com. The team’s official Twitter and Instagram accounts also have removed all references to Oakland.",

The Women’s Pro Baseball League (WPBL) announced last week that they are aiming to throw out their first pitch in less than two years’ time. The league is co-founded by Justine Siegal, also the founder of Baseball for All and the first woman to coach a professional men’s baseball team and to pitch batting practice against a Major League Baseball team. The logo on the league’s website depicts the letters in “WPBL” connected to each other, set in white on a black background. A baseball is depicted to the left of the W, aligned with the bottom of the letters. The league name is spelled to the right. The WPBL is also using a secondary logo as their social media profile picture. This logo consists of the W from the league logo, along with the baseball.

The WPBL will re-write history by creating an elite league that provides the world’s best female players with the platform they deserve and serve as a catalyst for the creation of a women’s baseball culture in America. “I am so excited that there will finally be a professional women’s baseball league – it is a dream come true for all the girls and women who play America’s Pastime,” Siegal said in a press release. “The Women’s Pro Baseball League is here for all the girls and women who dream of a place to showcase their talents and play the game they love. We have been waiting over 70 years for a professional baseball league we can call our own. Our time is now.” The WPBL’s other co-founder is Keith Stein, a Toronto-based lawyer and businessman who also serves as CEO of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Intercounty Baseball League. IBL players are college players and former professionals, and all nine teams are based in Southern Ontario. “We believe that the success of other women’s professional leagues such as the WNBA and NWSL demonstrates the incredible interest and support for women’s sport,” Stein said. Legendary Japanese pitcher Ayami Sato has joined the league as a special advisor, as has former Toronto Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston. The WPBL said in its press release that it will launch in summer 2026 with six teams based largely in the northeastern United States. Team names and logos were not included in last week’s announcement. The league also hopes to have a national broadcasting deal in place by the time the first pitch is thrown. More details about the league — including information for prospective team owners and players — is available on the WPBL website.  No related stories.",

Numbers to know for Week 9📰: https://t.co/BortIHSW58 pic.twitter.com/uDrzHXhIUF That includes the New York Giants breaking out their 1980-99 throwback uniforms for Sunday’s game against the Washington Commanders, marking the third straight year they’ll make an appearance against their NFC East rival. The uniforms feature a navy blue helmet with an underlined and italicized “Giants” wordmark on both sides, a royal blue jersey with a classic striping pattern on the collar and cuffs and white pants with red and blue stripes.  New York is 3-0-1 in the throwback uniforms since they debuted two years ago, including victories over the Chicago Bears in 2022 and the Commanders and Green Bay Packers in 2023. They also tied with Washington in 2022. TURN US UP.

Philadelphia went 2-0 in the throwback uniforms after unveiling them prior to last season, including wins over the Miami Dolphins and Buffalo Bills. They’ll also be worn later this season against the Dallas Cowboys on Dec. 29.  A classic look for a classic matchup#DETvsGB pic.twitter.com/NdhHY37ayw Keeping with the theme, the Green Bay Packers will wear their 1950s throwback uniforms during Sunday’s game against the Detroit Lions, marking their first appearance against an NFC North divisional opponent. The uniforms are reminiscent of what the Packers wore from 1950-53, with green jerseys featuring gold numbers and two gold stripes on the sleeves, green pants with a single gold stripe down the sides and green socks with stripes that match the sleeves.  The Packers are 2-1 in the throwback threads since they were unveiled, including wins over the Washington Football Team in 2021 and Los Angeles Chargers last season. Their lone loss came at the hands of the New York Jets in 2022.

Interestingly, the Buccaneers were considered the home team in that matchup, which they won 31-9, but chose to wear their white jerseys in the Super Bowl after having success in that combination throughout the 2020-21 playoffs.",

The Quebec Maritime Junior Hockey League team based in the provincial capital held a special “Les Boys” night on Friday, November 1, paying tribute to the 1997 comedy film that remains one of the most successful Quebecois movies ever. The Remparts’ jerseys for the game against the Sherbrooke Phoenix closely mirrored those worn by Les Boys, the team at the heart of the movie. The base of the jersey was yellow, with red shoulders and red, black and white stripes on the sleeves and waist. The front of the jersey featured a black puck with red streaks behind it and “Les REMPS” written overtop, taking cues from the logo used on the movie’s poster. Nos joueurs ADORENT le chandail des Remps…et on les comprend!Billets de c̷i̷n̷é̷m̷a̷ hockey » https://t.co/801IAPzOYP pic.twitter.com/1DaKuyCNEF The Remparts’ usual primary logo appeared on both shoulders. The names and numbers were red with yellow and black outlines. “LES REMPARTS DE QUÉBEC” was spelled out in black between the waist stripes to mimic where the name of the team’s sponsor appeared in the movie. The jerseys were paired with black helmets, pants and gloves. The socks were yellow with the same black, red and white striping pattern found on the sleeves. “Les Boys” was released in 1997 and directed by Louis Saïa. It follows a low-level amateur hockey team made up of a ragtag group of players, including a mechanic, a police officer, a doctor and a lawyer. In order to settle a gambling debt, the owner of the pub that sponsors the team puts up against a team assembled by a local crime boss. If Les Boys win, the debt is erased; if the mobster’s team wins, though, he gets the pub. “Les Boys” earned $3.3 million at the box office in Quebec, which, given the small market size, was considered a big success. It earned a total of $6 million at the box office across Canada and another $4 million in the United States. It also spawned three sequels — one of which featured appearances by several French-Canadian members of the Canadian Olympic women’s hockey team — one prequel and a television show that lasted five seasons.",

The Final Generation O Combo: Warp Speed.#GoDucks pic.twitter.com/CZZLb9vY8E The “Warp Speed” set is effectively the road version of the Ducks’ all-black “Fly Era” uniforms, which combine various elements from their previous uniform designs and debuted in their 32-31 win over Ohio State on Oct. 12.  That includes the wing pattern with a carbon fiber infill on the shoulders of the white jerseys, the diamond plate pattern that fits into the V-shaped seam of Nike’s Vapor F.U.S.E. template and the iridescent numbers, along other smaller details. The diamond plate pattern, specifically, was pulled from Oregon’s 2005-08 uniforms, and the decision to debut them in Ann Arbor isn’t a coincidence, either, as the Ducks notably beat the Wolverines, 39-7, in 2007. While our sources previously indicated the Ducks would wear dark green helmets on Saturday, just like they did in 2007, we’ve been told their equipment staff decided to switch up some combinations based on our reporting. Blinding speed. The story behind the threads.#GoDucks pic.twitter.com/tgecpLlqcO That’s why Oregon’s new “Warp Speed” uniforms are now complete with silver chrome helmets that feature silver wings and a green “O” on the back, creating a combination that was most recently worn in last season’s 38-30 win at Texas Tech. Interestingly, this won’t be the first time the Ducks wear the white pants from their “Warp Speed” set this season, as they also appeared in their 37-34 win over Boise State on Sept. 7 and 35-0 win at Purdue on Oct. 18. The other iiterations of Oregon’s new “Generation O” uniforms include the aforementioned “Fly Era” set, the “Gang Green” and “Mighty Oregon” throwback-inspired designs and their yellow and black “Heroes” uniforms, which are dedicated to those who have battled cancer.",

When Walker Buehler got Alex Verdugo of the New York Yankees to strike out, Dodgers fans rushed online, setting a new record for merchandise sales within the first hour after a championship clinch. This stat is according to Fanatics, who confirmed this was the highest initial sales figure across all sports throughout the online sports merch giant’s history. Within the first twelve hours of the victory, Dodgers merchandise sales were also 20% higher than during the same timeframe after their win four years ago back during the pandemic in 2020. Why is this? Well, they certainly got some help from the team’s sudden influx of fans in Japan. As you’d imagine, Japanese stars Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto were among the top-sellers regarding player-themed merch, with Mookie Betts, Clayton Kershaw, and World Series MVP Freddie Freeman also ranking high. (For what it’s worth, our Dodgers World Series gear affiliate links reported much fewer sales than usual. Maybe we don’t have too many Japanese readers!)
