In his 80th start, the Puerto Rico native grabbed his third ever top-five finish by carding an eagle, four birdies and three bogeys. Campos came into the day tied for the lead having shot the lowest round of his career (62) on Saturday. He started slow with a bogey on No. 4 and was 1-over stepping up to the drive on No. 6, which is when he made his move. A three-shot birdie on the par-4 gave him momentum, which he parlayed into an eagle on the par-5 seventh. Shaking off another bogey on No. 9, Campos quickly sank back-to-back birdies on the next two holes, putting him at 3-under with seven holes to play. Saturday's other co-leader, Andrew Novak. had a similar slow start, and while he applied some pressure with back-to-back birdies on Nos. 7 and 8, a bogey on 11 put him at even-par 71 for the day, three strokes behind Campos. Justin Lower, who entered the day a stroke back, fell off the pace, carding bogeys on 14 and 15 to fall to 1 over, taking him out of the running as he finished the round with a 72. From there, Campos did exactly what he need to do, shaking off his final bogey on 14 to sink a birdie on 17, setting up a two-stroke lead on Novak going into the final hole. Any hopes of a playoff were quickly dashed, as Novak's first shot sailed into the rough and his second went into the bunker. He ended up with a bogey on the par-4 No. 18.  Campos calmly hit for par to sew up his first career win on the same week his wife gave birth to the couple's daughter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Sinner needed just 85 minutes to defeat Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-4 for his 70th match win and eighth tournament victory of the season. In the process, Sinner made some history. He became the first Italian to win the tournament in its 55 years of existence and also the first player born in the 2000s to win the title. Sinner, 23, also became the first player to run through the ATP Finals without losing a set since Ivan Lendl did it in 1986. ""It's amazing, it's my first title in Italy and it means so much to me,"" Sinner said. ""It's something very special. I just tried to understand what works best for each opponent, trying to play my best possible tennis. That was the key. ""It was a very high level tournament from my side. At times, I couldn't have played better, so I am very happy."" He defeated Fritz and Daniil Medvedev of Russia in straight sets in group play, then eliminated Norway's Casper Ruud in the semifinals before the rematch with Fritz. Before their contest in Turin, Fritz and Sinner most recently played in the final of the U.S. Open, where the Italian prevailed in three sets. Sinner now is 4-1 against Fritz. Sinner also won the Australian Open this year. He joins Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only players to win Grand Slams in Australia and New York and the ATP Finals in the same season. Fritz, who will hit a career-high No. 4 in the ATP rankings on Monday, would have become the first American to win the event since Pete Sampras in 1999. Sinner won points on 83 percent (33 of 40) of his first serves and hit 28 winners against nine unforced errors. That included 14 aces. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After winning their first three games over Fordham, Quinnipiac and Wagner by a combined 76 points, the Red Storm began a challenging week that will see them face No. 12 Baylor in the Bahamas on Thursday.  St. John's (4-0) led New Mexico (3-1) for the final 33-plus minutes and placed five players in double figures to give Rick Pitino his third win in four career games coaching against his son Richard Pitino, the Lobos' coach and formerly at Florida International and Minnesota. Luis Jr. posted his second double-double this season and made 8 of 18 shots, including two of his seven layups in the final four minutes after St. John's survived New Mexico's final rally. Deivon Smith added 12 of his 15 points in the first half when the Red Storm led by as many as 16.

Nelly Joseph, who played for the elder Pitino at Iona, and Mustapha Amzil led the Lobos with 16 points apiece. CJ Noland added 15 and Donovan Dent was held to 12 as New Mexico shot 43.8 percent, missed 11 of 18 free throws and was unable to get its second win over a ranked team after beating then-No. 22 UCLA on Nov. 8. St John's began surging ahead when it scored 11 straight points and opened a 25-13 lead on a 3 by Luis with 7:24 left in the first half shortly after New Mexico burned a 30-second timeout. The lead expanded to 34-19 on Smith's layup with 4:26 left after Scott blocked Dent on the previous possession. The Red Storm held a 40-29 lead at halftime. Joseph's hoop cut the deficit to 63-59 with 8:01 left after Ejiofor was called for traveling, but St. John's began surging ahead again and took a 72-61 lead on Scott's basket remaining following two offensive rebounds. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

As Arkansas prepares for a visit from Pacific on Monday night in Fayetteville, Ark., forward Zvonimir Ivisic already can recite the top of the lesson plan. ""When you play good defense and then when you start running, you get, you know, you start to elevate. Playing better,"" Ivisic said. ""You make one transition, then you play good defense again."" Arkansas (2-1) created distance from Troy when aggressive defense finally began paying dividends on offense in the Razorbacks' 65-49 victory. The Razorbacks shot 29.4 percent from the field in the first half compared with 63.6 percent in the second half and collected 11 of their 14 assists after the break. There also were shortcomings, namely a minus-seven margin in rebounding, but Calipari said he sees promise as non-conference play continues. ""This is a good group. I'm enjoying coaching them,"" he said. ""I'm holding them to a high standard. I'm telling them that. I don't back up. This is what it is. How do you finish a game? How do you massage the ball? How do you get open late? You can't just jog around."" Ivisic exhibited that urgency with 19 points -- on 6-for-7 shooting from 3-point range -- plus five blocks, both career bests. Adou Thiero, who is averaging a team-high 17 points a game for the Razorbacks this seaon, also had 19 points along with seven rebounds against Troy, while teammate Boogie Fland contributed 12 points and seven assists. Arkansas hopes to get a scoring spark from D.J. Wagner in the backcourt. While he had a solid floor game against Troy with five assists, four steals and two rebounds, Wagner went scoreless on 0-for-4 shooting over 37 minutes. ""He's one of the greatest kids that I've ever coached. He is a player who plays to win,"" Calipari said. ""But we need him to score baskets, too. I told him the best shot he has is a floater. ... Just kaboom, let it go."" Pacific (3-2) is coming off a 60-57 home loss to Northern Arizona on Thursday. Despite struggling to a 39.2 percent shooting night and committing 17 turnovers, the Tigers chipped away at a 15-point deficit before falling short down the stretch. An Elijah Fisher 3-pointer with 2 seconds remaining brought the Tigers to the final margin. Elias Ralph paced Pacific with a double-double -- 23 points and 11 rebounds -- and added a career-best five assists. He surpassed the 20-point mark for the second time this season. Ralph and Fisher, who chipped in 13 points and eight rebounds against Northern Arizona, have scored in double figures in each of Pacific's five games. Another constant for the Tigers: strong perimeter defense. Pacific has limited foes to sub-30 percent shooting from 3-point land in each game, including holding Northern Arizona to a 5-for-30 effort. Arkansas figures to challenge that stoutness. Led by Ivisic's hot hand, the Razorbacks finished 10-for-23 from beyond the arc against Troy, including a 2-for-3 effort from Fland. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But the evidence shows the topic also is a national one. The No. 4 Bulldogs have the best record in the nation since the start of the 2019-20 season, and the Aztecs rank third as the two potent teams enter Monday night's epic non-conference showdown in San Diego. Gonzaga has a stellar .878 winning percentage (151-21 record) during the stretch. Houston (.843, 150-28) is second, with San Diego State (136-34) third while winning 80 percent of its games. The Bulldogs (3-0 this season) have reached two national championship games (2017, 2021) and the Aztecs (2-0) have been in one (2023) over the past seven NCAA Tournaments. This will be the second contest of a home-and-home series between clubs that are slated to be part of the Pac-12 in the 2026-27 season. Gonzaga was dealt a rare home loss last season when San Diego State registered an 84-74 victory in Spokane, Wash. ""Last year, when we beat them, it was the greatest thing in the world,"" Aztecs coach Brian Dutcher said. ""I'm not so sure it's so great with them coming in here; I think they'll have a long memory. This has been a great series. We don't play them every year, but when we do it's really competitive and it's been a lot of fun. ""(Bulldogs) head coach Mark Few has been great, giving us a chance to play them home-and-home. They can schedule anybody in the country and have. ... To get them at home is a great opportunity for our fans to see a really good basketball team against a developing Aztec team. We'll see if we're ready for the next step up."" This will be the first test of the season for San Diego State. It beat UC San Diego 63-58 and Division III Occidental 100-49 in two home encounters. Gonzaga opened the season with a 101-63 rout over then-No. 8 Baylor and followed with an 88-80 victory over Arizona State and a 113-54 pounding of UMass Lowell on Friday. Transfer Khalif Battle scored 21 points against UMass Lowell and is averaging 17.3 points per game. Battle has drained 11 of 18 3-point attempts. Battle previously played one season at Butler, three campaigns at Temple and last season for Arkansas, so he has seen a lot of different venues. He has been informed that San Diego State has one of the most raucous atmospheres in the country. ""It just feels good to go inside another arena and get a win and compete ultimately,"" Battle said. ""They're going to give us their best shot, we're going to give them our best shots, so whoever is victorious is victorious."" The large margin of victory over UMass Lowell displayed that the Bulldogs weren't looking past the contest. ""We've got a good mature group here, and we all know what needs to be done before a big game,"" Gonzaga guard Nolan Hickman said. ""This is just the showing of it."" Aztecs transfer guard Wayne McKinney III saw plenty of Gonzaga over the past three seasons while playing about eight miles to the west for San Diego of the West Coast Conference. ""It's always an up-pace tough battle against them,"" McKinney said of the Bulldogs. ""They always have their good scout team, and they have good players that come in every year ready to go. It's always a crazy environment, whether it's at The Kennel or elsewhere. It's always going to be a dog fight."" San Diego State is awaiting word on whether it will have ailing guard Miles Byrd (ankle), who scored 20 points in the opener and then sat out against Occidental. Dutcher said Byrd likely will be a game-time decision. The Aztecs have won three of the five meetings against Gonzaga. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""I think once we get better at that and learn how to play hard consistently on both ends of the floor then our depth will start to show more.""  NC State (3-0) hasn't played since Jayden Taylor scored 22 points in Wednesday night's 82-70 victory against Coastal Carolina.  Colgate (1-2) has been off since falling 74-72 at Syracuse on Tuesday night.  ""We let too many missed shots impact the next play and that can't happen against a good team,"" Colgate coach Matt Langel said. ""This game will prepare us well for the next game. We'll learn from the experience and move forward.""  Keatts said he likes the depth of scoring options for the Wolfpack.  ""We have a lot of guys who are all able to score anywhere from 15 to 18 points just depending on the night and the opponent,"" Keatts said.  Still, Taylor's role with the team has grown since a season ago. He is averaging 16.3 points over the first three games. In 41 games (29 starts) last season, he averaged 11.2. ""I like it, just being aggressive, kind of playing my game and taking what the defense gives me,"" Taylor said.  The Wolfpack were without a 3-point basket in the Coastal Carolina game, but made up for that with 28 points on free throws.  NC State hasn't trailed in either of its past two games.  Colgate will play its second consecutive opponent from the Atlantic Coast Conference on Monday. The Raiders outscored Syracuse 12-2 on points off turnovers and 22-2 on fastbreak points.  ""Offensively we created great looks throughout the game -- a couple good shots late with the game on the line,"" Langel said.  The Raiders and Wolfpack have met only once.

Both the RedHawks and Wolverines have relatively new rosters, so in addition to each having 2-1 records, they'll want to continue to find an identity and continuity as the non-conference season progresses.  Featuring a roster with seven new players, Miami is coming off an 88-70 win over Maryland Eastern Shore on Tuesday. Miami head coach Travis Steele said limiting turnovers and getting back on defense will be the biggest keys for his team against the Wolverines. ""I've got to see us take care of the ball,"" he said. ""I think that's where it starts, valuing the ball. When we've done that, we've looked pretty good on offense. Pass the ball, don't overdribble it and run our offense. No. 2, can we keep them off the glass? They're going to be pretty big. We've done a pretty job of that so far this year, on the defensive glass specifically. And then can we get back in transition defensively? They play really fast, so we have to be really disciplined how we crash the glass, how we sprint back and how we build walls around the ball. We have to make them play halfcourt offense."" The RedHawks are led by forward Kam Craft, whose 19 points per game average ranks second in the MAC. He is averaging 3.7 3-pointers made per game. Michigan, which has 12 new players on this year's roster, is coming off a solid 76-64 win over TCU on Friday in what could be a decent NCAA Tournament resume win by season's end.  Michigan won despite committing 21 turnovers, but head coach Dusty May hopes that's just part of the process of integrating a large number of players at the same time.  ""As long as we're being conscious about learning and getting all these things into our long-term development, then all of these games will pay dividends later and help us win those games when they really, really matter,"" May said. ""They really matter now, but when they really, really matter."" The leading scorer for the Wolverines is Auburn transfer Tre Donaldson, averaging 13.3 points per game. The guard also leads the team in assists (4.7). This will be the first meeting between the programs since 2006. The Wolverines lead the all-time series 5-1. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Notre Dame improved to 9-1 with its eighth straight victory, crushing Virginia in a 35-14 rout more lopsided than the final score suggests. Quarterback Riley Leonard threw two of his three touchdown passes to Jayden Harrison and Mitchell Evans, fitting perfectly with the Senior Day celebration during the Irish’s regular-season home finale.

His sideline shouting matches with receivers Chris Hilton Jr. and Kyren Lacy gave the impression of a season rapidly spiraling out of control. “Our inability to score touchdowns and points continues to crop up,” Kelly said following the game, LSU’s second straight in which it failed to reach 20 points. “As coaches, we have to take responsibility. Players have to own their end of it."" “Our team’s got to make a decision on how they move forward,” he added. Kelly’s demeanor on Saturday exuded far more frustration than dejection; dejection seems a more apt description of his postgame address following the 2021 Rose Bowl Game. In Notre Dame’s second College Football Playoff appearance of Kelly’s tenure—and the Fighting Irish’s third genuine pursuit of a national championship in the 11 years Kelly helmed the Golden Domers—the team ran into an Alabama buzzsaw. The 31-14 loss was the most competitive of Notre Dame’s three national title flirtations during the Kelly years, coming after a 30-3 rout against Clemson in the 2018 Cotton Bowl and the notorious 42-14 BCS Championship Game beatdown in 2013. A third dream season ending with a thud seemingly left Kelly at a loss. He spent another season in South Bend, but the end seemed inevitable after that Rose Bowl. In spring 2022, when Kelly lamented that Notre Dame and he “didn’t seem to be on the same page,” he detailed his decision to take over at LSU as the necessary step to win a national championship. “I want to be in an environment where I have the resources to win a national championship,” Kelly said at the time. “And I came down here because I want to be in the American League East.” Well, with the New York Yankees losing the most recent World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers, the AL East has not claimed baseball’s top prize since 2018. The college football landscape is not quite as drastically different as it was when the SEC monopolized seven straight national championships from 2006 through 2012—the last of those consecutive titles coming at Kelly’s expense. However, with Michigan claiming the most recent championship, Oregon ranked No. 1 in 2024, and the usual SEC juggernauts, Alabama and Georgia, showing rare vulnerability with two losses each, the road to the top may not have to traverse the Southeast. LSU now sits at 6-4. After falling to No. 22 in the most recent Playoff rankings, logic dictates the Tigers will be out of the poll altogether come Tuesday. Notre Dame, meanwhile, should climb, especially with No. 7 Tennessee losing at Georgia. When Kelly lamented that he and Notre Dame were not on the same path, he may have been correct—just not in the way he intended. Copyright 2024"

The Dallas Cowboys are in the midst of a forgettable season, sitting at 3-6 and with starting quarterback Dak Prescott sidelined the rest of the season. Now, much attention is on who may be the Cowboys’ next coach. Yes, McCarthy is still under contract, but his five-year deal expires at the end of the season. This is a very similar situation to the Jason Garrett era, as owner Jerry Jones—despite running the most valuable franchise in the world—refuses to buyout coaches early. Garrett entered the 2014 season as a “lame duck,” but earned a five-year extension after leading the Cowboys to a 12-4 record and NFC East title. Garrett faced the same situation in 2019, but didn’t get an extension after posting the fourth 8-8 season of his tenure. Jones continued the trend of coaches entering “lame duck” seasons with McCarthy and his staff in the final year of their contracts. All signs point toward McCarthy’s fate being that of Garrett following the 2019 season. With that being said, who could the Cowboys turn to in 2025? Jones provided the latest fodder when he was asked about former tight end Jason Witten being a future NFL head coach during a radio appearance on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas. “Yes, without hesitation,” Jones told the station on Friday. “He has something that you can’t draw up. He reminds me a lot of our other tight end, who is head coach up there in Detroit right now [Dan Campbell].” Witten is currently coaching at Liberty Christian High School in Argyle, a Dallas-Fort Worth suburb, leading the school to a state championship in 2023. Witten, for all of his accolades as a player, has never coached at the NFL level. Campbell, on the other hand, had 10-plus years coaching in the league before being handed the reins in Detroit. Simply put, it would be quite the jump for Witten. Deion Sanders is another former player who has been mentioned as a candidate, as he’s enjoying success in the college ranks. Eagles offensive coordinator Kellen Moore, who finished his playing days with the Cowboys and then served as a coach, including as the team’s offensive coordinator from 2019-22, has been a favorite of Jones. Another name worth mentioning is Kliff Kingsbury, the Commanders’ offensive coordinator and former Cardinals coach. Of course, Bill Belichick will always be listed among the possibilities. He’s the greatest football coach of this generation, and it’s easy to wonder what could be with him becoming the Cowboys coach. But Belichick also had losing seasons in three of his last four years in New England. All of those names mentioned will create plenty of talk show segments and buzz. And with Jones making the ultimate decision, who knows? Maybe one of them emerges as the next coach. However, there is one name that would make more sense than anyone mentioned—former Titans coach Mike Vrabel. Vrabel is the betting favorite to become the next Cowboys coach. Vrabel would be widely viewed as a home run hire, too, as he won two AFC South titles and reached the playoffs three times in six seasons with the Titans. Plus, Vrabel would be the first defensive-minded head coaching hire the Cowboys have made since bringing in Wade Phillips in 2007. They’ve since tried the promising up-and-coming offensive guru (Garrett) and then brought in a proven winner (McCarthy). Both had success to varying degrees, but the Cowboys are going on 29 years since reaching the Super Bowl. The Cowboys have cycled through six coaches in that timeframe. Maybe Lucky No. 7 returns the franchise to glory. Copyright 2024"

For a team with seven of nine wins by a one-score margin, we cannot put our trust—or coin—behind the unwanted, temporary heir to Harrison Butker. And so we turn our attention to the other AFC slugfest, Ravens vs. Steelers, where the numbers tug in opposite directions. Baltimore’s unstoppable top-ranked offense. Pittsburgh’s tenacious D. Mike Tomlin’s borderline mastery of Lamar Jackson (1-3 as a starter). No, we can’t go there either. But will be watching.Instead, we’re taking our spend elsewhere, tracking down as many teams that cannot get out of their own way as we can. Nobody should rule out the +176 (FanDuel) moneyline if they believe strongly in the see-you-next-year mindset of the Jets entering Sunday's game. Yes, mathematically, NY is still hanging by a thread, but the six-point output at Arizona is all the arithmetic we need.  Let's talk about the Colts since they've decided to turn back to quarterback Anthony Richardson. He's completing barely 44 percent of his passes and tends to tire in the second half of road games (apparently). But the Colts are better for bettors than they are Shane Steichen's resume at 7-3 ATS this season and have been in every game in the fourth quarter. Recent trends indicate the Jets might not be strong enough to force the Colts to throw. Last week, the Cardinals rushed for 147 yards, one week after the Texans put up 187 on the ground; the Patriots (112), Steelers (149) and Bills (149), too, all since mid-October. Aaron Rodgers has done a fine job keeping teams close with his own accuracy issues, and the Colts arrive with more legitimate postseason motivation despite three consecutive losses. Even if you are concerned the Jets really, really turn it on and set a season-high with 25 (!) points, we ride with the horseshoes. Opponents have six first-quarter touchdowns against the Jets.

Mac Jones barely moved the chains last week, and Jacksonville's only touchdown was scored by the Trevor Lawrence replacement on the ground. Lawrence is still out, and Jacksonville is out of its league, with big changes looming.  If you need imagery for this blowout, who among the NFL coaching ranks is more likely to toss roadkill on the grill than Dan Campbell?  That's what we thought. Even if you want to pick on the past two showings for the Lions—both wins, mind you—this isn't a team that plays down to competition. And if anyone can get a locker room to believe Jared Goff is the second coming after a five-interception outing at Houston, it's Detroit's Campbell.  Houston was unable to run the ball against Detroit. But C.J. Stroud found answers we are almost certain Mac Jones won't find against the Lions. The Lions beat the Seahawks by 13, dropped 52 on the Titans (in a 38-point win) and smacked the Cowboys 47-9 on the road.  The bet: Lions -13.5, Jahmyr Gibbs 25+ receiving yards, +164 (FanDuel) $100,000 Daily Race Sign up now to claim For help with a gambling problem, call or text the NCPG - (1-800-522-4700)  First Bet Safety Net $1000 or Bet $5 & Get $150 Sign up now and get the choice of two incredible offers.

On the grass. Short week. If you take the recency multipliers and combine them with the enormous egg laid by the Rams' offense last week, there's a skyscraper-sized stack of reasons to run away from the road favorites at Foxborough.  But New England is getting kudos by the bushel for beating a Bears' team that started two backups at offensive tackle and made merely a modest attempt to run the ball. We're not saying the Rams are Super Bowl-bound, but the Patriots are still starting a rookie quarterback with minimal playmakers when stacked up against the receivers and running back Matthew Stafford can deploy.  Kyren Williams stands as the centerpiece of this game plan until the Patriots prove they can stop him. He has 10 touchdowns from scrimmage; New England has 16 total. Three times this season and twice in the past three weeks, Stafford has doubled up on TD tosses.

But after their 4-1 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on Saturday, the Canucks head into Sunday's clash with the visiting Nashville Predators on a winning note and with proof of what they can do when they play to their potential. ""Now we've got to make it two games in a row. Make it our identity,"" Vancouver forward Elias Pettersson said. The Canucks have managed a surprisingly weak home-ice record (3-3-3) to start the season. The low point was the 5-2 beating at the hands of the New York Islanders on Thursday, after which coach Rick Tocchet apologized to their fans. The boo birds were cheering the Canucks when the final buzzer sounded against the Blackhawks, however. ""Since I've been here, me personally, I felt this team has responded after bad efforts,"" Tocchet said. ""I haven't seen them string a lot of bad efforts. I commend the players."" The Canucks took over Saturday's game in the second period, during which they erased a one-goal deficit and grabbed hold of the momentum. ""I think we got too stale in the neutral zone, didn't come with speed, and when they got the puck deep, they were breaking it out easy,"" Pettersson said, when asked what helped them gain the upper hand. ""Getting more speed in the neutral zone changed it for us."" Now to see whether the Canucks can do the same against another struggling visitor to their arena. ""They're a tough opponent,"" Pettersson said. ""We've got to re-charge the batteries and be ready to go."" The Predators have dropped the first three contests in a five-game road trip, with the latest setback a 2-0 decision to the Calgary Flames on Friday. Nashville dropped consecutive 3-2 overtime losses to begin the trek. ""It was a tight hockey game,"" Predators coach Andrew Brunette said of the game versus the Flames. ""Ice was at a premium. I thought they defended real well and we failed to really create a whole lot besides when we got desperate at different times late in the game."" The Predators had extremely high hopes going into the season with the addition of a trio of veteran free agents in forwards Steven Stamkos and Jonathan Marchessault and defenseman Brady Skjei. Instead, they limped out of the gates with five consecutive losses in regulation. It appeared they had turned the tide by going on a 4-1-1 run but since have just one wins in their past seven games (1-4-2). ""I feel like we're hoping to win right now,"" captain Roman Josi said. ""We're not really going out there and attacking the game, like getting a win. We're just kind of hoping and we'll see what happens."" One saving grace for the Predators is a reflection to last season. They were floundering until a 16-0-2 run in February and March sprung them into a playoff berth. ""The position (we're in), we need to get some points, we need to get some wins,"" Josi said. ""We've got to attack the game and get out there and play to win. ... We're not doing that right now."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Clippers return to their new arena after dropping all three games of a road trip, including consecutive defeats against the Houston Rockets. The most recent of those losses came Friday when the Rockets stormed off to a 125-104 victory.  Clippers leading scorer Norman Powell was held to a season-low eight points Friday, well below his season average of 23.6 per game. In the two games at Houston, Powell averaged 10.5 points, shot 27.6 percent from the floor and 3 of 11 from 3-point range (27.3 percent).  In a rare moment to savor on the trip, Los Angeles veteran James Harden made three 3-pointers Friday to tie Ray Allen for second on the all-time list with 2,973. Harden had 21 points but finished with a season-low two assists. Harden has averaged 8.3 assists this season.  ""I think they did a great job of denying me and denying James, taking us out of initiating our action, pushing us all the way out to the half court to start our offense,"" Powell said. ""They were physical. They took us out of what we wanted to do.""  Still without Kawhi Leonard (knee) this season, and when teams hold Powell and Harden in check, Los Angeles' route to victory becomes limited. The Clippers now are on high alert for opponents to adapt the Rockets' plan against them.  ""We'll get back to the lab and figure out how to beat that adjustment, especially if teams are going to start doing that,"" Harden said.  The Jazz are starting to emerge from a rough start to the season, which they opened on a six-game losing streak. They have gone 3-3 since, but have yet to win consecutive games after falling 121-117 on the road to the Sacramento Kings on Saturday.  Lauri Markkanen scored 25 points for Utah, while Keyonte George added 19 and Collin Sexton had 18. The Jazz led by as many as nine points in the fourth quarter and were up 116-113 with 1:54 remaining but made just one free throw the rest of the way.  Markkanen missed three consecutive games with a back injury as the calendar flipped to November, but has averaged 18.8 points in the past four games.  Jazz forward John Collins is putting up a team-best 17.9 points per contest, even while coming off the bench in the first nine games. Since moving into the starting lineup for the past three games, he has averaged 24.3 points.  ""John has done a really good job of using his physicality,"" Jazz head coach Will Hardy said. ""He's attacked the switch really well, and our team has looked for him in those moments. He's also been able to find some rhythm 3s.""   Jordan Clarkson is rounding into form after missing a pair of games to start the month with a foot injury and scored 17 points in 30 minutes off the bench Saturday.

The Hurricanes will bring a 6-1-0 record at Lenovo Center into their game with the St. Louis Blues on Sunday in Raleigh, N.C. The Hurricanes have won 10 of their last 12 games overall. They are coming off a 4-0 victory over the Ottawa Senators on Saturday. Goaltender Spencer Martin recorded his first career shutout. He will continue to see more action with Frederik Andersen facing a pronounced absence and possible surgery for a lower-body injury. ""It is the most important position, and that was a great game by (Martin),"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""It enabled us to get the victory, for sure. He made some big saves. There was a lot of really close calls, and he saved us."" Still, Carolina may start Pyotr Kochetkov in goal against the Blues.  Kochetkov exited the Hurricanes' 4-1 loss to the Utah Hockey Club on Wednesday with an undisclosed injury but he recovered enough to participate in Carolina's morning skate Saturday. ""We probably could've stuck him in there (Saturday),"" Brind'Amour said. Kochetkov allowed four goals on 19 shots when the Hurricanes lost to the Blues 4-3 on Oct. 19. Blues forwards Mathieu Joseph and Jake Neighbours each recorded a goal and an assist in that game. Martin Necas earned an assist against the Senators, extending his point streak to 12 games. Sebastian Aho has a goal and five assists in his last six games. Brayden Schenn scored 2:53 into overtime to lift the Blues to a 3-2 victory over the Boston Bruins on Saturday afternoon. St. Louis, which snapped a four-game skid (0-3-1), outshot Boston 31-17 while playing one of its better games since losing No. 1 center Robert Thomas and key defenseman Nick Leddy, Philip Broberg and Pierre-Olivier Joseph to injuries. ""We definitely deserved to win that game, there was no question,"" Blues coach Drew Bannister said. ""If we get a little puck luck, you know, that game could have been out of hand at the end of the second period. I thought our guys were great in all three zones. We created a lot offensively."" St. Louis opened its three-game road trip with a 4-3 overtime loss to the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday. After getting two points against the Bruins, St. Louis will try to cool off the Hurricanes. ""Tough place to play, there's no room in Carolina, they come at you hard there, they're a great home team,"" Schenn told the FanDuel Sports Network. ""For us, this is a chance to make it a good road trip. ""We're battling hard right now; we're in a position to go into three tough buildings and grab some points. Got to re-focus for (Sunday), grab our energy and expect a skating game with no room out there.""

Now, one day short of six months since that game, the Mavericks and Thunder will square off Sunday in Oklahoma City. ""The playoffs is over,"" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said of the matchup. ""We used that to learn more about our system, learn more about our players as we headed into the summer. Now it's a new season."" The Thunder have had plenty of success so far this season even as they've been shorthanded. Injuries to big men Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein have forced Oklahoma City to go small, but it's worked. They sit atop the Western Conference with an 11-2 record. Dallas coach Jason Kidd has a center issue as well, as Dereck Lively II has started the past two games on the interior after Daniel Gafford started the season's first 11.  ""They've both played well as starters, they've both played well off the bench,"" Kidd said. ""So we'll see how D-Live handles these next couple games as the starter and we'll figure out who's going to start after that. ... If it was the '80s, we would play them at the same time but unfortunately it's not the '80s so only one can play and right now D-Live is the starter."" Sunday's game is the second night of a back-to-back for the Mavericks, who beat the San Antonio Spurs 110-93 on Saturday to snap a four-game losing streak. Oklahoma City, which closes out a season-long six-game homestand Sunday, leads the NBA in drives per game with 62, but is second-to-last in free-throw attempts per game at 19.6. Officiating has been a point of frustration for Daigneault. ""I'm, like, lighting them up tonight,"" Daigneault said Friday after his team attempted 18 free throws in a 99-83 win over the Phoenix Suns. ""Not because of one call tonight, but there's a cumulative frustration we have at this point because our guys are working too hard."" Phoenix attempted 40 free throws in that Thunder win. ""It's capping us offensively,"" Daigneault said. ""And the guys want to improve, you know? And they're asking how we can improve, and it's like there's only so much we can improve on if we're not getting to the line."" On Saturday, Daigneault was asked again about the low free-throw numbers, and he called back to his remarks the day before. ""The numbers are the numbers,"" Daigneault said. ""And I was just laying out the numbers, really, in the context of how do we improve offensively with that type of free-throw rate? ... I'm not going to get into assumptions or anything like that, you know. I'm going to just stay to the facts and the facts are the facts."" In addition to being without Holmgren for the fourth consecutive game after suffering a pelvic fracture that's going to keep him out at least two months, the Thunder will also be without guard Alex Caruso for the third consecutive game.

Whether Chytil will join the Rangers later on the trek, which also will comprise stops in Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton, is uncertain. ""Right now he's still getting evaluated, and we'll see,"" Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said after practice Saturday and before the team boarded a flight for the Pacific Northwest. Chytil suffered an upper-body injury in the second period of a 3-2 victory against the visiting San Jose Sharks on Thursday when he collided with teammate K'Andre Miller. Chytil returned for one shift later in the period before being ruled out for the rest of the game. Through 15 games this season, Chytil has nine points (four goals, five assists) and a plus-11 rating centering the third line with Will Cuylle and Kaapo Kakko. The concern for Chytil is compounded because he missed all but 10 games last regular season with an upper body injury that was believed to be a concussion. ""We're always careful with players,"" Laviolette said. ""Nobody jumps back without doctors and everybody doing their job. When players come back out on the ice and get put into games, they're healthy."" New York's Mika Zibanejad scored his first goal in nine games in Thursday's victory. ""It's nice to contribute,"" he said. ""This means I get to go home and enjoy tonight with my family."" Zibanejad had three turnovers that led to goals in the Rangers' 6-3 loss to Winnipeg on Tuesday.

""I think it was a big goal just for him to get that going and for the team to kind of jump-start us as well."" Jimmy Vesey and Vincent Trocheck scored one goal apiece for New York on Thursday, and Artemi Panarin had an assist to extend his point streak to six games. Goaltender Igor Shesterkin made 25 saves. The Kraken will go for a sweep of the New York teams after defeating the visiting Islanders 3-2 in a Saturday matinee. Defenseman Jamie Oleksiak scored the winner at 16:47 of the third period on a slap shot from the blue line that deflected off the skate of the Islanders' Brock Nelson. That came after the Kraken's fourth line of Brandon Tanev, Yanni Gourde and Tye Kartye pinned New York deep in its own end. ""I think we just stuck to what has been giving us success,"" Oleksiak said after the Kraken improved to 4-0-0 on their six-game homestand. ""Obviously, the Gourde-Tanev-Kartye line has been really good for us, and on the game-winning goal, I didn't do anything crazy. I just worked hard, got the puck at the point, got it to the net, and it went in for us."" Gourde and Jared McCann also scored for Seattle, with McCann extending his point streak to five games (four goals, three assists). ""You have to take your own bite by pounding it out, taking your chances when you can get them, and drive it down to the other end,"" Kraken coach Dan Bylsma said. ""I thought the first period -- we talked about our starts -- we came out, and the first couple of swings were in our favor. ... You just had to stay with it for 60 minutes."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

And it's the Hornets who have the next shot at trying to put the first blemish on the Cavaliers' record.  The teams will meet Sunday evening in Cleveland.  Kenny Atkinson is the only coach in NBA history to win in his first 14 games with a new franchise.  ""I knew it's a group that liked each other and enjoyed playing with each other, and I knew that we had good passers,"" Atkinson said. ""You've got your major scorers, but the guys around them can pass the ball. I think that's what you're seeing right now. The ball really moves.""  The Cavaliers posted a season-high point total in Friday night's 144-126 victory against the visiting Chicago Bulls.  Six teams have won their first 14 games in NBA history, but Cleveland is the first to do so in almost a decade.  Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell has reached the 30-point mark in four games this season, including his season-high 37 points against Chicago.  Darius Garland has been an ideal complement to Mitchell, who averages 24.6 points per game, in the backcourt.  ""It's the ultimate luxury,"" Atkinson said. ""They have a shared understanding. When you have two ball handlers like that, it's an absolute luxury.""  Cleveland had its two closest results against Milwaukee in back-to-back games earlier this month, winning 114-113 and 116-114.  The Cavaliers continue to be challenged by Atkinson.  ""We haven't lost, but how do you continue to find ways to build habits?"" Mitchell said. ""It's continuing to coach hard and not let any lapses. That's what you want in a coach.""  The Hornets are fresh off Saturday afternoon's 115-114 victory against visiting Milwaukee, riding a strong second half from LaMelo Ball. Ball made the tying and go-ahead free throws with 7.1 seconds to play as Charlotte snapped a two-game losing streak.  Ball, who's averaging 29.6 points per game, notched 15 of his 26 points in the second half. He has led Charlotte in scoring in 10 of 12 games this season.  Two of the Hornets' five victories this season have come by one-point margins.  Others are starting to form good support around Ball. Newcomer Josh Green has been identified as one of those influential newcomers.  ""The energy, the competitiveness he plays with, you see it every night defensively where he's wreaking havoc,"" Hornets coach Charles Lee said of Green.  Charlotte has dropped four straight road games for a 1-4 mark away from home.  The Hornets received a boost from Tre Mann's 11 points off the bench Saturday after he missed the previous game because of a lingering ailment. So with games on back-to-back days, his availability might be in question.  A double-double from Moussa Diabate on Saturday -- 12 points and 14 rebounds -- was reason for optimism for the Hornets.  ""He's hungry, hungry to play, hungry to compete, hungry for every offensive rebound,"" Lee said. ""I've loved his tenacity on both ends of the court.""  Sunday will mark the first of four meetings this season between the teams. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Jalon Daniels completed 12 of 19 passes for 169 yards and one interception, but his biggest contribution was a fourth-quarter punt that struck a member of the Cougars and was recovered by the Jayhawks (4-6, 3-4) at the BYU 3-yard line. Neal scored the winning points on the next play, and Kansas protected the lead. The setback is a major blow for the Cougars (9-1, 6-1), who dropped into a first-place tie with Colorado and will slip downward when the next College Football Playoff rankings are unveiled on Tuesday. BYU's Jake Retzlaff completed 18 of 28 passes for 192 yards, one touchdown and one interception. Hinckley Ropati had a scoring reception for the Cougars. Neal extended his school record to 45 rushing touchdowns, and his 52 yards rushing made him the first player in program history to top 4,000 on the ground. His total sits at 4,003. No. 1 Oregon 1, Wisconsin 13 Atticus Sappington's 24-yard field goal capped a 10-point fourth-quarter rally as the Ducks staved off an upset with a comeback victory over the host Badgers. Oregon (11-0, 8-0 Big Ten), which entered averaging 35.7 points per game, took over at the Wisconsin 43 after a 12-yard punt return with just under seven minutes left. On third-and-4, quarterback Dillon Gabriel eluded pressure and scrambled 8 yards for the first down at the 8. After Gabriel's third-down pass was incomplete, Sappington hit his third field goal of the game to put the Ducks up 16-13 with 2:36 remaining. Wisconsin (5-5, 3-4) lost its third straight.

No. 3 Texas 20, Arkansas 10 Quinn Ewers passed for 176 yards and touchdowns early and late to Matthew Golden as the Longhorns did just enough on the road to beat the Razorbacks in a key Southeastern Conference clash in Fayetteville, Ark. The game was the first for the two programs as league foes since 1990 when they were a part of the now-defunct Southwest Conference. The intensity still was high as the Longhorns (9-1, 5-1 SEC) stayed on track for a spot in the SEC Championship Game in their inaugural season in the conference. Jaydon Blue rushed for 83 yards on 14 carries as Texas outgained the Razorbacks 315-231 in total yards.

Warren totaled eight catches for 127 yards and a score and also had a 48-yard scoring run.

Milroe completed 11 of 16 passes for 186 yards, didn't throw an interception and ran for 43 yards and a touchdown on six carries to lead Alabama.

Braxton Woodson, who came on for Horvath, turned the ball over twice in a rough outing. He completed 3 of 10 passes for 13 yards with an interception and rushed 13 times for 24 yards while fumbling the ball away deep in Navy territory. --Field Level Media --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Everything was going Indiana's way in the second half when Carlyle banked in a 3-point shot from just inside half court to give the Hoosiers a 49-35 lead with 16:46 remaining. It was supposed to be a pass to Mgbako, who sealed his defender, but the ball sailed over the top of the defense and into the hoop.

The bout was called at 4:29 of the third round.  It was Jones' first fight since March 2023, and the 37-year-old successfully returned to the octagon after undergoing pectoral surgery that postponed a meeting with Miocic at UFC 295.  Jones (28-1-0) paid his respects to Miocic after the fight on Saturday, admiring his toughness. ""He's really, really good,"" Jones said of Miocic. ""He's really tough. He's really durable. I hit him with some pretty decent shots, and he just kept coming forward."" Jones had zero glaring holes, having an answer for every Miocic strike thrown his way. While Miocic (20-5-0) opted to retire after the fight, Jones plans to stick around at heavyweight. ""I've decided maybe I will not retire,"" Jones said, noting that he plans to speak with UFC CEO Dana White and UFC chief business officer Hunter Campbell. ""We'll negotiate. If everything goes right, maybe we'll give you guys (the fans) what you want to see."" Lightweights Charles Oliveira (35-10-0) and Michael Chandler (23-9-0) met in the co-main event, a rematch of a championship fight that happened over three years ago. Oliveira won four of five rounds, making the most of several submission attempts and unorthodox striking. Round 5 saw a near-dramatic turn for Chandler. After dropping Oliveira with a hook, Chandler landed several non-defended strikes, some of which were to the back of the head. Despite that surge, Oliveira reversed position and found Chandler's back. Oliveira took the cards 49-46, 49-46, 49-45. Despite dropping his fourth fight in five outings, Chandler called out Conor McGregor following his bout on Saturday.  Middleweights Bo Nickal (7-0-0) and Paul Craig (17-9-1) were next. Nickal won by unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27), keeping his name in the running as a divisional contender entering 2025. Viviane Araujo (13-6-0) avoided a potential losing streak, defeating Karine Silva (18-5-0) in women's flyweight action. Araujo's control time was too much for Silva, as she utilized her clinch work to dictate the fight's pace.  The main card opened with Mauricio Ruffy (11-1-0) winning by unanimous decision against James Llontop (14-5-0) in a battle of catchweights.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

USA Gymnastics said that Karolyi died Friday, but the organization did not reveal a cause of death.  Karolyi guided a then-14-year-old Comaneci to gold at the 1976 Games in Montreal, five years before he and his wife defected to the United States. He then turned Retton, who was 16 at the time, into the first American to secure the Olympic all-around title. She accomplished the feat in Los Angeles in 1984.  However, Karolyi often faced criticism for his coaching style, especially when USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar was given a decades-long prison sentence for sexually assaulting hundreds of gymnasts and other athletes.  With Nassar in the spotlight because of his crimes, more than a dozen gymnasts spoke out against Karolyi, claiming that he helped create an oppressive culture that allowed Nassar to get away with his wrongdoings for years.  Both Karolyi and his wife, Martha, who was also a coach, told CNN in 2018 that they did not know what Nassar had been up to, but they still decided to step out of the public eye in the wake of the Nassar trial.   USA Gymnastics eventually stopped sending its athletes to train with the Karolyis.  Karolyi retired from coaching following the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta, and he was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1997.   That didn't mark the end of Karolyi's time with the U.S. gymnastics team, though, as he was hired as national team coordinator in 1999. In that role, he helped implement a semi-centralized system into the program that turned Team USA into a powerhouse.  Still, Karolyi didn't last long as coordinator, getting let go after the 2000 Olympics. His impact is still felt today, however, as women from the United States have won each of the past six Olympic titles.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Jalon Daniels completed 12 of 19 passes for 169 yards and one interception, but his biggest contribution was a fourth-quarter punt that struck a member of the Cougars and was recovered by the Jayhawks at the BYU 3-yard line. Neal scored the winning points on the next play, and Kansas protected the lead. The setback is a major blow for the Cougars (9-1, 6-1 Big 12), who dropped into a first-place tie with Colorado and will slip downward when the next College Football Playoff rankings are unveiled on Tuesday.

Daniels delivered a 26-yard pooch punch that caromed off the head of BYU's Evan Johnson, who had his back to the punt and was running downfield. Jakob Robinson of the Cougars dove to collect the ball, but it escaped his grasp and it was recovered by Kansas' Quentin Skinner at the Cougars' 3.

The puck came to Brannstrom at the top of the left circle while his team was buzzing around the offensive zone, and he found the mark with a long slap shot. Miller, with his sixth goal of the season, and Blueger, who notched his third, added empty-net goals in the final two minutes of regulation time for the Canucks, who won their third game in nine home outings (3-3-3). Mikheyev opened the scoring with his second goal of the season at 6:50 of the first period. Nick Foligno was denied on his chance coming when he drove to the net, but Mikheyev -- who spent the last two seasons with the Canucks -- was on the spot for the rebound. The Canucks had all the momentum in the second period and were rewarded when Pettersson's power-play goal tied the clash at 4:56 of the frame. Pettersson's attempt to pass the puck across the edge of the crease became his fifth goal of the season, and third in four games, when it banked into the net off the skate of Blackhawks defenseman Connor Murphy. Connor Bedard, Chicago's 2023 first overall draft pick, played his first NHL game in his hometown. Last season's Calder Trophy winner as the NHL's rookie of the year was held off the scoresheet and managed only one shot on net. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""I think that is, if not the best team in the country, one of the best teams in the country,"" Duquette said of Gonzaga. ""I coached at the high major level for 13 years in the ACC and the Big East, and I haven't seen many teams that big with that much depth and that many weapons.

Guard Quinton Mincey was the lone River Hawk to reach double digits in the game, scoring 10 points against the Bulldogs. Max Brooks added nine points and a team-high seven rebounds, with Cam Morris III and Martin Somerville also scoring nine apiece. The River Hawks (2-1) hope to keep it a lot closer against the Huskies (2-1), who are in their first season under coach Danny Sprinkle. Washington rallied from an 11-point halftime deficit to defeat visiting Seattle Pacific, a Division II school, 77-62 on Wednesday night. ""I thought our energy was off in the first half for whatever reason. We didn't have any juice,"" Sprinkle said. ""I just kind of challenged the team at halftime. I asked them, 'What defense do you want to play? You need to take ownership of this. This is you guys.' ""They said after every make, we're picking up full and we're pressuring, which is what we should have been doing in the first half. But to give our guys credit, the energy changed and the defensive intensity changed."" DJ Davis and Great Osobor each scored 18 points for the Huskies, with Osobor grabbing eight rebounds and making seven steals. Tyler Harris added 13 points, five rebounds, four blocks and four steals off the bench. ""The (halftime) message was play like us,"" said Davis, a senior guard who returned to the lineup after missing last Saturday's 63-53 loss at Nevada to attend the birth of his child.

The Celtics were without Jrue Holiday, who missed the game because of left knee tendinopathy. Before the game Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said he didn't expect Holiday's injury to linger. It was the first game Holiday has missed this season. Boston used a 12-0 spurt to take a 14-4 lead, but the Raptors were within two points, 28-26, after 12 minutes.

Jacolby Criswell ran for a touchdown and threw for a score to help North Carolina (6-4, 3-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) to its third consecutive victory. Wake Forest (4-6, 2-4) has lost back-to-back games, dropping a road game for the first time in four trips this year despite running back Demond Claiborne running for two touchdowns and 95 yards. Starting quarterback Hank Bachmeier was replaced in the second half by Michael Kern, but the switch didn't work out as Kern threw two interceptions and lost a fourth-quarter fumble. Trailing 24-17, Wake Forest force a punt and took the ball over with 5:40 to play. Two plays later, Joshua Harris' sack of Kern forced a fumble that was recovered by Travis Shaw at the Demon Deacons' 18. From there, Hampton carried on five consecutive plays, the final one a 6-yard TD run. Kern hit Taylor Morin for a 16-yard touchdown play with 1:15 left to make it a one-score game but Wake never got the ball back. Hampton, who had 35 carries, set a team record with eight consecutive games of 100 or more rushing yards.

New Mexico State (2-8) dropped its third in a row and suffered its eighth loss in its past nine games. Reed's performance was a welcome sight for Texas A&M, which was hoping to see needed improvement in its passing game after a season-ending knee injury to starting running back Le'Veon Moss. So much of A&M's offense came from Moss, who accounted for 906 yards from scrimmage. The Aggies entered the game ranked 113th in the nation in passing offense. Reed completed 20 of 31 passes and threw one interception. But he set the tone early with a 16-yard touchdown pass in the back of the end zone to Noah Thomas on Texas A&M's opening drive.

After their game Sunday, the Golden Knights head to Canada for games in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal and follow that with contests in Philadelphia and Colorado before returning home to face the Winnipeg Jets on Nov. 29. Vegas is 8-1-0 at T-Mobile Arena this season but lost to the Carolina Hurricanes 5-2 in its last home game on Monday, snapping a franchise-record-tying eight-game home win streak. The Golden Knights bounced back with a 3-2 win at Anaheim on Wednesday and a 4-2 come-from-behind victory over Utah on Friday in Salt Lake City.

Washington will be playing the second of a three-game road trip that began with an impressive 5-2 victory over the Colorado Avalanche on Friday and concludes with a back-to-back set against the Golden Knights and Utah. Connor McMichael scored twice to give him a team-leading 12 goals and Alex Ovechkin had an assist to hit the 20-point mark (10 goals, 10 assists) for Washington. According to the NHL, Ovechkin joined Gordie Howe (six goals, 18 assists, 24 points in 1968-69) as the only two players 39 years old or older in league history to score 20 points through the first 16 games of a season. The Capitals held Colorado to a season-low 19 shots on goal, including none for reigning Hart Trophy winner Nathan MacKinnon, who led the league entering Saturday with 33 points. It marked the first time in 79 games dating back to Nov. 27 last season against Tampa Bay that MacKinnon was held without a shot in a game. ""I thought we did a phenomenal job against their top players,"" Washington coach Spencer Carbery said. ""It wasn't just one line. It was our entire lineup that had to play against those guys and did a phenomenal job."" Carbery singled out the play of forward Pierre-Luc Dubois, who had two assists, for his play in the win, including playing a good chunk of the contest defensively against MacKinnon's line. ""It's not easy playing here on the road against this team,"" Dubois said. ""We knew before the game that you don't always choose your matchups, and it was going to take a great effort from the six (defensemen) and all four lines, and I think that's what we really did well."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The No. 12 Bears could be headed for a second straight decisive home victory when they face the Tarleton State Texans on Sunday night in Waco, Texas. Baylor (2-1) embraced some serious competition right out of the gate, facing two ranked opponents. After being blown out 101-63 at Gonzaga in their season opener, the Bears responded with a 72-67 victory over Arkansas in Dallas on Nov. 9. Scott Drew's group finally enjoyed a comfortable result with Tuesday's 104-67 rout of Sam Houston in the Bears' home opener. Baylor's shooting improved in each contest and made 58.6 percent of their shots Tuesday. The Bears also hit 14 of 32 from 3-point range after going a combined 10 of 45 in the first two contests. ""We're a much better shooting team than our first two games' statistics showed,"" Drew said. ""I don't know if we'll shoot (44 percent from 3-point range) all year, but we're a 40 percent shooting team, and we have good shooters."" Jayden Nunn (13.7 points per game) and Duke transfer Jeremy Roach (11.3 ppg) went a combined 7 of 13 from distance against Sam Houston. Nunn is 9 of 15 from beyond the arc in the last two games after missing all five attempts versus Gonzaga. Meanwhile, prized freshman VJ Edgecombe took advantage of a favorable matchup Tuesday by recording 13 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists and three steals. He shot 6 of 9 from the field after going 5 of 23 in the first two games of his college career. ""We're just staying ready,"" Edgecombe said. ""Defensively, offensively we're connected (Tuesday). But, we're going to continue to get better, for sure. (Tuesday) is not how good we're going to be."" Meanwhile, Baylor's collective heart likely lies with veteran forward Norchad Omier, who has averaged 16 points and 10.3 rebounds in his three games since transferring from Miami. Omier & Co. could again be in store for a lopsided victory versus Tarleton State (1-3), which was outscored by an average margin of 27.7 points in losses to SMU, Sam Houston and Florida State before an 88-57 win over NAIA school Tabor College on Thursday. ""You never know what can happen when everyone is pulling in the same direction,"" Tarleton State coach Billy Gillispie told the Full Court Press Podcast. Gillispie formerly guided prominent programs at Texas A&M and Kentucky.

Oregon (11-0, 8-0 Big Ten), which entered averaging 35.7 points per game, took over at the Wisconsin 43 after a 12-yard punt return with just under seven minutes left. On third-and-4, quarterback Dillon Gabriel eluded pressure and scrambled eight yards for the first down at the 8. After Gabriel's third-down pass was incomplete, Sappington hit his third field goal of the game to put the Ducks up 16-13 with 2:36 remaining. The Badgers failed to get a first down on their ensuing possession when Braedyn Locke's pass on fourth-and-9 was incomplete, giving the Ducks the ball on the Wisconsin 26. Oregon was stopped short on a fake field-goal attempt, with Wisconsin taking over at its own 17 with 1:45 left. Locke's second-down pass was batted into the air and picked off by linebacker Matayo Uiagalelei. Wisconsin (5-5, 3-4) lost its third straight. The Badgers need one more victory to keep its streak of 22 consecutive bowl games alive. Gabriel completed 22 of 31 passes for 218 yards without a touchdown and one interception. Jordan James carried 25 times for 121 yards and the Ducks' lone touchdown. Held to two field goals through three quarters, the Ducks tied it 13-13 on James' 11-yard touchdown run with 13:14 remaining. Gabriel kept the 81-yard drive alive with a 15-yard completion to the Badgers' 26 on fourth-and-9.

The Badgers overcame a slow start to take a 10-6 lead on Locke's 2-yard touchdown pass to Will Pauling with 25 seconds left in the first half. Locke set up the score with a 43-yard completion to Vinny Anthony II to the Oregon 16.

San Jose State (6-4, 3-3) drove to the Broncos' 2 and faced fourth-and-1. The Spartans lined up to kick a field goal but then called timeout and brought the offense back on the field. San Jose State tried a trick play with Eget rolling one way and throwing the ball back to offensive lineman Sione Nomani, but Boise State safety Seyi Oladipo stopped Nomani short of the first down. Boise State responded on its next possession. Madsen capped an 11-play, 92-yard drive with a 4-yard TD run to trim the Broncos' deficit to 14-7.

Sunday's matchup between the in-state counterparts marks their first encounter as nonconference opponents since 1921. USC (3-0) continues a lengthy homestand to open its first season in the Big Ten and its first under the direction of head coach Eric Musselman. With Musselman on the sideline and an almost entirely new roster from a season ago, the Trojans look much different than the team Cal beat in their last meeting nine months ago. Desmond Claude, the hero of USC's 98-95 win over UT Arlington on Wednesday with 26 points and eight assists, transferred in from Xavier. Josh Cohen, who scored 19 points on Wednesday, is a transfer from UMass. Although the Trojans roster was put together in the offseason, Cohen said it has jelled quickly. ""This group is super together. If you see our bench where everyone is cheering for each other, it isn't a separate group,"" he said. ""It starts with our leadership."" USC's togetherness on the court has manifested thus far in the Trojans combining for at least 20 assists in all three of their initial games. Cal (2-1) underwent its own dramatic lineup changes ahead of its inaugural ACC campaign. All six Golden Bears who have started a game this season played elsewhere in 2023-24, including wing Andrej Stojakovic. Stojakovic, a top 25-ranked recruit in the 2023 high school signing class, transferred from Cal rival Stanford. He has scored at least 15 points in each of his first three games as a Golden Bear. Backcourt mate and Grand Canyon transfer Jovan Blacksher Jr. has also scored in double figures in all three contests. The former two-time All-Western Athletic Conference honoree fills a role for Cal similar to that of Claude for USC. ""Jovan's so experienced. He's been through so much with the injuries,"" Stojakovic said, referring to a torn ACL that sidelined Blacksher for much of the 2022-23 season. ""He's very versatile. He can play off the ball, on the ball, and I'm glad he decided to join us."" Blacksher will lead Cal's effort to rebound from an 85-69 loss on Wednesday at Vanderbilt. The Golden Bears dug an 18-point halftime hole and could not recover vs. the Commodores. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

McDavid scored his seventh of the season at 1:51 of the second period during a power play on a clear shot from a rebound that followed Zach Hyman's deflection of Draisaitl's shot. Tavares was off for hooking. Toronto's Ryan Reaves was assessed a match penalty at 2:41 of the second for an illegal hit to the head of Edmonton's Darnell Nurse, who was out for the rest of the game with what was termed an upper-body injury. Edmonton failed to score on the accompanying five-minute penalty. Toronto had a five-on- three power play for 57 seconds starting at 11:22 of the second but did not threaten. Knies tied the game with his eighth of the season at 13:08 of the third period after the puck came to him on a sloppy pass by defenseman Evan Bouchard. McMann won a race for a loose puck to put Toronto ahead at 14:07 of the third. Draisaitl jammed in his 13th goal of the season at 18:31 of the third to tie the game with Skinner removed for an extra attacker. Toronto's Auston Matthews (upper-body injury) missed his sixth straight game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

A two-time Vezina Trophy recipient, Bobrovsky turned aside 10 shots in the third period to preserve his first shutout of the season and the 45th of his career. Barkov scored a short-handed goal and set up two other tallies, while Reinhart notched three assists to extend his point streak to 10 games. Mackie Samoskevich, Evan Rodrigues, Nate Schmidt and former Jets defenseman Dmitry Kulikov each scored a goal for the Panthers, who snapped a two-game skid. The teams will reconvene on Tuesday in Winnipeg. Connor Hellebuyck made 26 saves and defenseman Josh Morrissey was a minus-three while playing in his 600th career game for the Jets, who have lost two in a row after winning 15 of their first 17 to start the season. Florida benefited from a fortunate bounce to open the scoring with 5:01 remaining in the first period. Gustav Forsling's cross-ice pass caromed off the stick of Winnipeg defenseman Dylan DeMelo and went into the net off the body of Samoskevich. The goal was Samoskevich's third of the season. Schmidt also scored his third goal of the season to double the Panthers' advantage at 2:07 of the second period. He accomplished the feat by cleaning up a rebound after Sam Bennett's drive to the net. Rodrigues corralled a loose puck in front of the net following defenseman Aaron Ekblad's slap shot from the point and beat Hellebuyck to boost Florida's lead to 3-0 at 12:21 of the second period. The goal was Rodrigues' fifth of the season and fourth in his past seven games. Barkov tacked on another goal just 2:15 later by winning the race to a rebound and burying a backhand past Hellebuyck. The goal was Barkov's third of the campaign. Kulikov redirected a pass from Barkov past Hellebuyck to cap the scoring at 3:23 of the third period. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The 29-year-old journeyman goalie made his second start of the season and 54th in his career. He responded by making 25 saves.   Carolina needed just eight minutes to take the lead. Jordan Martinook's shot from behind the goal line banked off Ottawa netminder Anton Forsberg. Jordan Staal assisted as the Hurricanes won a scrum near the corner.   Ottawa was called for too many men with 50 seconds left in the second period, giving Carolina a brief five-on-three advantage.   The Hurricanes pounced on the eight-second two-man advantage. Sebastian Aho's one-timer beat Forsberg just before Shane Pinto, who was called for slashing to start the initial power play, left the penalty box. With Carolina still having a man advantage, Jackson Blake's putback 43 seconds into the third period gave the Hurricanes a 3-0 cushion.   Shayne Gostisbehere assisted on both of those goals. Martin Necas extended his scoring streak to 12 games with his circle-to-circle pass to Aho, and Andrei Svechnikov earned an assist on Blake's fifth goal of the season.   Though Martin did not need to make a lot of saves, he did deny the Senators on several quality chances. That included a sliding stop on Pinto's breakaway attempt just before the second period ended and a glove save on Brady Tkachuk in the final minute of the game.   William Carrier finished the scoring with 4:54 left on an empty-netter set up by Staal and Martinook.   Martin got the start because the Hurricanes scratched Pyotr Kochetkov, who left the team's last game Wednesday in Utah with an undisclosed injury. The team also called up Yaniv Perets from its Chicago AHL club to be the backup.   As the horn sounded to end the game, Martin held his stick up high before his teammates congratulated him. He could get the start again on Sunday when the Hurricanes host the St. Louis Blues.   Forsberg made 24 saves in the loss. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Monangai scored from 2 and 6 yards out, the latter giving the Scarlet Knights a 21-17 lead with 5:14 left in the third quarter. He finished with 97 yards on 25 carries after missing last week's game with an undisclosed injury. Kaliakmanis completed 20 of 30 throws for 238 yards for Rutgers (6-4, 3-4 Big Ten), which clinched bowl eligibility in consecutive seasons for the first time since making four straight bowls from 2011-14. Billy Edwards Jr. went 32-of-55 for 335 yards with a touchdown and an interception, while Roman Hemby tallied 87 rushing yards and a score as the Terrapins lost their third straight game. Maryland (4-6, 1-6) must win its last two games to make a fourth straight bowl. The Scarlet Knights seized control after Hemby's 1-yard run slid the Terrapins ahead 17-14 early in the second half. Monangai's second score put Rutgers back in front, and Dymere Miller's 32-yard catch on the first play of the fourth quarter extended the lead to 28-17. Miller finished with eight receptions for 107 yards, both game-highs. Jordan Thompson intercepted Edwards at the Scarlet Knights' 28-yard line on Maryland's next possession, and Jai Patel drilled a 46-yard field goal to make it 31-17 with 9:53 left. Rutgers' defense notched fourth-down stops on the Terrapins' next two drives to seal the victory. Maryland converted 3 of 6 fourth downs overall, while the Scarlet Knights finished 3-for-3. Jack Howes' 48-yard field goal with 2:01 left in the first quarter put Maryland up 3-0.

Dante Fabbro scored and Daniil Tarasov made 25 saves for the Blue Jackets, who have lost seven of eight. Matheson scored on the power play to give Montreal a 1-0 lead at 4:59 of the first period. Caufield sent a quick pass to Matheson at the top of the slot for a one-timer past a screened Tarasov. That spurred the Canadiens, who built up a 10-4 shot advantage by the midpoint of the period. The Blue Jackets started to pick up their pace as the frame progressed, getting more chances as they narrowed the shot deficit. That continued into the second period and Columbus was rewarded at 7:40, with Fabbro tying it 1-1. Moments after Sean Kuraly's shot from the slot missed high, Zach Werenski fed Fabbro at the left point for a one-timer through traffic that beat a screened Montembeault glove side. Columbus controlled the puck for much of the period, limiting Montreal to one shot on goal just past the midway mark. The Canadiens got back on track in the latter half of the period and capitalized, with Nick Suzuki putting them ahead 2-1 at 15:49. Armia sent a short feed in the neutral zone over to Suzuki, who carried it in before cutting to the high slot and snapping it under Tarasov's glove.

Brunson and the Knicks will look to build off Friday's last-second win on Sunday night, when they host the Nets in another clash of the local rivals. It's the second straight game between the clubs, who were off Saturday after Brunson sank the game-winning 3-pointer with 6.2 seconds left to lift the Knicks past the visiting Nets 124-122 in NBA Cup Group A action. Brunson's timely shot allowed the Knicks to improve to 2-0 in Group A play and helped them avoid a second straight disappointing defeat. New York overcame a 22-point third-period deficit Wednesday but fell to the Chicago Bulls 124-123 when Brunson's shot rimmed out at the buzzer. On Friday, the Knicks squandered a 21-point third-period lead and fell behind for the first time since the first quarter when Dennis Schroder drained a 3-pointer with 12 seconds left in regulation.  Following a timeout, Brunson took an in-bounds pass from Mikal Bridges and sized up Dorian Finney-Smith for a few seconds before hoisting a jumper that got nothing but net. The Nets, who were out of timeouts, raced up the court, but Schroder's layup was blocked by Bridges. Ariel Hukporti cradled the rebound as time expired. With the win, the Knicks -- who were expected to challenge for the NBA title after adding Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns during the summer -- evened their record at 6-6 and avoided falling two games under .500 for the first time since November 2023. ""That is the nature of this league,"" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""We had the emotion of that last game and that disappointment. And then to bounce back like we did tonight -- to find a way at the end speaks volumes to who (Brunson) is, to have that resolve to take that shot and make that shot."" Brunson's dramatics cost the rebuilding Nets a chance at a statement win in their Group A opener. Brooklyn telegraphed its intentions to rebuild by dealing Bridges to the Knicks in July for a package that included seven draft picks. But the Nets (5-8), who entered Saturday among the 10 teams in the Eastern Conference within three games of the third-seeded Orlando Magic, have exceeded expectations under first-year head coach Jordi Fernandez. The Nets have lost four of their last five but have held fourth-quarter leads in that stretch against the Knicks as well as the defending NBA champion Boston Celtics and the unbeaten Cleveland Cavaliers. The Celtics earned a 108-104 overtime win on Nov. 8 before the Cavaliers outlasted Brooklyn 105-100 the next night. The Nets' lone recent lopsided defeat was a 139-114 loss to the Celtics on Wednesday in which Fernandez criticized his team's effort and response. But Fernandez found encouragement in Brooklyn's furious fourth-quarter rally Friday, when it outscored the Knicks 40-24. ""They stayed together right there,"" Fernandez said, ""That's a sign of, when you hear that from your players, it's like, OK, we're going to get there. And to see it at that point, (a) 40-point quarter, took the lead, it's pretty impressive."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But he's confident the stuff that steered him to a 28-point outburst on Friday can keep the surging Rockets rolling, beginning with Sunday's visit to the Chicago Bulls. Heeding advice from coach Ime Udoka, Smith focused on other parts of his game to help take his mind off his shooting slump. Hence, the 11 rebounds and two steals that accompanied an 11-for-17 effort from the floor that included 5-for-8 from long range in the Rockets' 125-104 home win against the Los Angeles Clippers. ""Tonight, I was just kind of letting it fly. Not thinking about it so much. Getting out of my own head,"" Smith said. ""That was really it. Nothing really different, you know what I'm saying? Just less thinking."" A reactive mindset prevailed in the Rockets'  victory as they dished 31 assists on 46 made field goals. Alperen Sengun had 10 assists to go with 16 points and 10 rebounds for his fifth career triple-double. Fred VanVleet had 18 points and 10 assists in a double-double. ""I thought our execution was good,"" VanVleet said. ""The ball was moving. Quick decisions. Nobody was really holding it."" The Bulls and Rockets have split their past 10 meetings, but the Bulls have won three of the last four at the United Center. Chicago hopes to conclude a busy week on a high note. The Bulls have sandwiched separate losses to the unbeaten Cleveland Cavaliers between a nail-biting road victory over the New York Knicks. Despite a strong one-two punch from Coby White (29 points) and Nikola Vucevic (25), the Bulls failed to boost their momentum from the Knicks game in Friday's 144-126 loss at Cleveland. After an Ayo Dosunmu dunk brought Chicago within four points with 2:55 to go, the Cavaliers scored 21 of the game's final 28 points. Josh Giddey, the key returning piece in an offseason trade that sent defensive stalwart Alex Caruso to Oklahoma City, wasn't on the floor in the stretch run after some lapses on defense. ""I want to be better on that side of the ball and thought I was making steps in the right direction,"" Giddey said. ""To have a night like tonight kind of kills your confidence. I have to (be) way better and will be going forward."" With Giddey limited to 15 minutes, Patrick Williams (17 points) and Zach LaVine filled much of the void in the distribution department, contributing nine assists apiece. Chicago had 32 assists on 45 made field goals and was 20-for-42 from deep. The Bulls have finished with at least 30 assists in seven games and swished 20 or more 3's three times.

Mired in a seven-game skid, the Wizards haven't been having much fun of late. Kyle Kuzma collected 24 points and nine rebounds in Washington's 129-117 loss to the host Atlanta Hawks on Friday. Kuzma, however, was left to lament a lot of missed opportunities. ""I had good rhythm today. Just missed a couple layups,"" said Kuzma, who shot 11-for-28 from the floor and 2-for-11 from 3-point range. ""Make a couple layups and you're at 50 percent, then nobody talks about it. It doesn't really matter, you know?"" Rookie Alexandre Sarr added 20 points on Friday while making 7 of 13 shots from the floor, including 3 of 4 from 3-point range. Sarr, the No. 2 overall pick of the 2024 NBA Draft, shut out the jeers from the vocal crowd in Atlanta by adding four steals and three blocks. ""It's pretty funny to me,"" Sarr said of the crowd's reaction while playing his second game in Atlanta. ""So I love playing here."" The teams split their four-game season series in 2023-24, with the road club winning each time. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

According to the Hawks, Daniels has tied the record for longest streak in NBA history with at least 15 points and five steals at four games, matching NBA icon Michael Jordan. Daniels, acquired from the New Orleans Pelicans in the Dejounte Murray trade in July, leads the NBA in steals with 3.8 a game (42 in 11 games). His defensive acumen has carried over into the entire team, which is fifth in the Eastern Conference standings. ""Anytime you have someone that takes the amount of pride he does in defending, when you're out on the floor with him (his teammates) can't help but raise their level as well,"" Hawks coach Quin Snyder said. ""It's something we have worked on. Dyson impacts the game in a lot of different ways."" Daniels had a career-high 28 points in the Hawks' 117-116 road win over Boston on Tuesday and followed up with 25 in Friday's 129-117 home win over the Wizards. Against the Wizards, the Hawks welcomed back veteran De'Andre Hunter, who missed 10 games because of a knee injury and then to spend time with his newborn daughter. Hunter added 22 points off the bench against the Wizards. ""It's good to have him back,"" Snyder said. ""I thought he played the way that we talk about a lot. He was aggressive from three. He's a good shooter and he can get that shot off and that sets him up attacking the rim. He's a pro."" The Hawks are still without Bogdan Bogdanovic, who played in only one game before sustaining a right hamstring injury. Trae Young is also dealing with right Achilles tendinitis. The Trail Blazers are coming off a two-game sweep of the Minnesota Timberwolves at home despite missing Deandre Ayton with a finger injury and Anfernee Simons with a chest issue. Ayton is listed as questionable and Simons will miss the contest. Portland coach Chauncey Billups was asked about the status of his two stars Friday. ""I think (Simons) is feeling a little better, but not the best though, we are just waiting to see how he continues to progress,"" Billups said. ""(Deandre) wasn't able to practice. I have a hard time thinking (he would play Sunday), but I am not sure."" Portland has still struggled offensively, scoring just 106.8 points a game, which ranks 26th in the NBA. They've gotten a big boost from rookie 7-foot center Donovan Clingan in the last two games. Clingan had 17 points, 12 boards and eight blocks in the win over the Timberwolves on Wednesday. His eight blocks were one off Bill Walton's single-game Blazers record. Clingan, the seventh overall pick in the 2024 draft after a stellar career at Connecticut, is already reaching folk hero status in Portland. ""I think what's so surprising here is just how young he is and how inexperienced he is,"" said Billups. ""He's not even used to playing this many minutes. To me that is what's most impressive, to play that much and to be able to stay that focused."" The all-time series between the two franchises is tied at 62, and each team has won the match-up on its home court each of the last five years. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

With the return of Desmond Bane and Vince Williams Jr. from the injured list Friday night -- and the return of Marcus Smart earlier in the week -- the Grizzlies had all but two-time All-Star guard Ja Morant available among its usual starters. When the Grizzlies host the Denver Nuggets on Sunday, Morant will remain sidelined as he recovers from a right hip injury. Morant has been out since suffering a posterior hip subluxation on Nov. 6 in a home game against the Los Angeles Lakers. Morant crashed to the floor attempting to complete an alley-oop dunk. The Grizzlies continue to list his return as week-to-week. Both Smart and Bane were injured in an Oct. 30 game against Brooklyn. Smart turned an ankle and Bane suffered an oblique strain. Bane had missed seven consecutive games. Bane and Smart, normally starters, came off the bench during Friday's 123-118 NBA Cup game loss at Golden State. Bane played 27 minutes -- the second-most among Memphis players -- and finished with 18 points in his first use as a reserve since the 2001 season. Smart had nine points and six assists. Key reserve Williams made his season debut and contributed nine points, five rebounds and four assists. Williams had been out since suffering a shin injury in the preseason. The Grizzlies struggled despite approaching full strength. Memphis was 7 of 42 (16.7) percent from beyond the arc, one of the worst long-range shooting performances in franchise history. With the exception of Jaylen Wells (2 of 6), Memphis starters went 0-for-11 from 3-point range. Through three quarters, the Grizzlies were shooting 36.5 percent overall from the floor. ""We started knocking down some 3s late in the fourth quarter, we got to the rim, we got fouled, got some easier layups,' said Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins. ""I just kept pressing that we were going to play our style throughout the game, and it just caught up with us (too) late in that fourth quarter when we really got going."" Denver also fell in its NBA Cup debut game against the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday night, struggling without three-time league MVP Nikola Jokic, who missed the game because of personal reasons. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Memphis. Dario Saric filled in for Jokic on Friday and had nine points, eight rebounds and five assists in 34 minutes. ""Obviously, it's impossible to fill Nikola's shoes, so I try to do my best,"" Saric said. ""And I think I can make better decisions especially when I try to blitz or double team."" Without Jokic controlling the defensive boards, New Orleans was able to grab 17 offensive rebounds during its 101-94 victory. New Orleans outrebounded Denver 56-38. ""They were crashing the glass, they were trying to cause turnovers,"" said Nuggets assistant David Adelman, filling in for head coach Michael Malone, who missed the game to attend his daughter's state volleyball match. ""We knew how aggressive they were going to be. The glass lost us the game. There's no question about it, it was the deciding factor. When you don't make shots, and you play that good of defense for 24 seconds, and you're doing all the right things, you have to finish possessions, and we didn't do it."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Trojans (5-5, 3-5 Big Ten) came into Saturday's contest 0-5 in one-score Big Ten games, accounting for all of their losses on the season. But Maiava, a UNLV transfer, gave USC some breathing room with a 2-yard touchdown run with 2:45 remaining in regulation, and Greedy Vance Jr. made a leaping interception of Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola's pass in the end zone as time expired. The victory came after a stretch in which USC dropped 4-of-5 games and its bowl hopes were hanging in the balance. For Nebraska (5-5, 2-5), Saturday's setback marked its fourth straight. Maiava was announced as USC's starting quarterback last week during the Trojans' bye week, taking over for beleaguered Miller Moss. Maiava shined in his debut in completing 25 of 35 passes and all four USC touchdowns, but not before a rocky start. Maiava was unofficially in on five touchdowns, giving up a Pick-6 to Ceyair Wright -- a Los Angeles native and former Trojan -- in the first quarter for the game's initial score. The Trojans quarterback settled in the rest of the way, throwing scoring strikes of 6 yards to Zachariah Branch on a swing pass, 12 yards to Kyron Hudson and a deep ball to Duce Robinson for a 48-yard touchdown. Robinson caught four passes for a game-high 90 yards. Woody Marks rushed 19 times for 146 yards, an average of 7.7 yards per carry.

Boston College turned the ball over on downs on the ensuing drive before the teams combined to trade scores on each of the next four possessions, beginning with a Rogers 35-yard field goal late in the first.

Garrett Nussmeier completed 27 of 47 passes for 260 yards and touchdown for the Tigers (6-4, 3-3), but he was sacked seven times. On its first possession of the third quarter, LSU drove to Damian Ramos' 45-yard field goal to take its only lead of the game at 13-10. On the ensuing possession, Florida dove to Trey Smack's 55-yard field goal to tie the score. Lagway's 36-yard completion to Badger set up Ja'Kobi Jackson's 1-yard touchdown run that gave the Gators a 20-13 lead with 13:58 remaining. The Tigers converted a third-and-11, a fourth-and-three and a fourth-and-four to reach the Florida 21-yard line before stalling and Ramos kicked a 38-yard field goal to trim the lead to 20-16 with 5:18 left. On the third play after the ensuing kickoff, Jadan Baugh ran 55 yards for a touchdown and a 27-16 lead. LSU reached the Gators' 31 on the ensuing possession, but turned the ball over on downs. Lagway threw a 23-yard touchdown pass to Badger to give the Gators a 7-0 lead midway through the first quarter. The score stayed that way through the end of the period after Ramos was short on a 52-yard field-goal attempt. The Tigers tied the score midway through the second quarter when Nussmeier threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Aaron Anderson on third-and-nine. Smack kicked a 49-yard field goal to give Florida a 10-7 lead. LSU drove to the Gators' 25 before Nussmeier was sacked and Ramos kicked a 50-yard field goal that tied the score at halftime. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Longhorns (3-1) were down by two points about eight minutes into game but took charge late in the first half, using a 17-5 run on the way to a 10-point lead at halftime. Texas expanded the margin to 17 early in the second half and poured it on from there, even as it emptied its bench over the final five minutes for the final 46-point margin. Julian Larry added 13 points for Texas while Kadin Shedrick had 12 points and Jordan Pope scored 10.  The Longhorns made 17 consecutive shots from the floor after a miss by Johnson with 15:07 to play, shot 64.4 percent for the game and 77.8 percent (21 of 27) in the second half. Alvin Stredic led the Delta Devils (1-3) with 11 points with Greg Moore scoring 10. The Longhorns sputtered out of the gate, missing eight of their first 10 shots and trailing Mississippi Valley State 12-10 after Moore hit a layup at the 11:44 mark of the first half.  Texas went in front for good on Larry's layup for a 14-12 lead at the midway mark of the half. The Longhorns continued to add to their advantage over the ensuing six minutes, taking a 27-17 lead when Kaluma canned a pair of free throws with 3:50 to play in the half. Texas led 33-23 at the break despite just one point from Johnson and no player with more than Kaluma's nine points before halftime. The Longhorns outscored the Delta Devils by 13 points at the free-throw line over the first 20 minutes. Stredic paced the Delta Devils with eight points in the half. Mississippi Valley State made two more field goals than the Longhorns (10-8) but shot just 37 percent from the floor. Johnson -- and the Longhorns -- woke up in the second half, with the talented freshman scoring nine of Texas' first 11 points after halftime to spur the home team to a 44-27 lead. Texas was up 48-32 with 14:23 remaining before unleashing an 11-0 run over the ensuing three minutes keyed by two buckets in the post by Kaluma and a layup and a 3-pointer by Johnson. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The No. 8 Fighting Irish (9-1) won their eighth consecutive game and inched closer to securing a playoff berth. Notre Dame has two games remaining as it faces No. 24 Army next Saturday at Yankee Stadium in New York and travels to Los Angeles to face USC on Nov. 30th. Virginia (5-5) was unable to carry over the momentum from last week's upset win over Pitt and got off to a poor start immediately due to turnovers. Chris Tyree muffed the opening kickoff and Notre Dame's Max Hurleman recovered four seconds into the game. This led to Love scoring from four yards out to open the scoring for the Fighting Irish. It was Love's 10th consecutive game with a touchdown and he joined Jerome Bettis, Autrey Denson and Wayne Bullock as the only other Notre Dame running backs with such scoring streaks. Love would add another score in the third quarter when he broke loose for a 76-yard score down the sideline to put the Irish ahead 35-0. Leonard threw all three of his touchdown passes in the second quarter to help the Irish break the game open, and take a 28-0 edge into halftime. The scores came off three of the four turnovers Virginia committed in that quarter. Three of those giveaways were interceptions thrown by Cavaliers' starter Anthony Colandrea. Virginia committed five turnovers -- all in the first half including a muffed punt. Virginia benched Colandrea, who completed only 8 for 21 passes for 69 yards, replaced him with Tony Muskett in the second half. Muskett scored the Cavaliers' only two touchdowns, first on an 18-yard run with 7:52 left in the third quarter and later a 2-yard sweep to the corner of the end zone with 18 seconds left in the game. A couple of Virginia defensive players left the game with injuries as linebacker James Jackson suffered an apparent leg injury and safety Corey Thomas Jr. left the game in the first half as well. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Allar finished with more touchdowns than incompletions, as he went 17 of 19 for 247 yards without a turnover for the Nittany Lions (9-1, 6-1 Big Ten). Warren totaled eight catches for 127 yards and a score and also had a 48-yard scoring run.   Hudson Card passed for 151 yards and Max Klare had 91 receiving yards and a touchdown for Purdue (1-9, 0-7), which has not won since Week 1 and has not beaten Penn State since 2004. The Boilermakers have faced three top-five opponents in the last month, losing those games by a combined margin of 129-10.   The Nittany Lions wasted no time featuring the Allar-to-Warren connection. The two hooked up for gains of 15, 17 and 27 yards on the opening drive of the game, setting up Allar's 2-yard scoring strike to Kaytron Allen.   On the next Penn State trip, Allar found Warren for 9 yards on third-and-2 early on the drive. The march ended with Allar's 15-yard touchdown pass to Warren, making it 14-0.   The Boilermakers got on the board with a field goal midway through the second quarter, but the ensuing possession featured a backwards pass from Warren to Allar, who then threw back across the field to Warren for a 38-yard gain. Nicholas Singleton plunged in for a 10-yard score on the next play, making it 21-3.   That was still the score at halftime before the visitors erupted for three touchdowns in the third quarter -- all covering 40-plus yards.   First, Warren took a direct snap and went 48 yards for a touchdown. Then Allar found a wide-open Harrison Wallace III in the end zone for a 46-yard score. And finally, backup QB Beau Pribula kept the ball on a read-option and sprinted 49 yards to make it 42-3.   Purdue's only touchdown came midway through the fourth, when backup quarterback Ryan Browne found Klare for a 20-yard score.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Yanni Gourde and Jared McCann also scored for the Kraken, who improved to 4-0-0 on their six-game homestand. Goaltender Joey Daccord made 22 saves, including one on a short-handed breakaway by Brock Nelson with 1:55 remaining. Pierre Engvall and Nelson scored for the Islanders, who had a five-game point streak snapped (3-0-2). Ilya Sorokin stopped 24 of 27 shots. Oleksiak's winner came after Seattle's fourth line of Gourde, Brandon Tanev and Tye Kartye pinned the puck deep in New York's end of the rink. The puck came back to Oleksiak, whose blast deflected off Nelson's skate and past Sorokin. Islanders coach Patrick Roy challenged the play, claiming Tanev had interfered with Sorokin in the crease, but a replay determined there was no penalty. Tied at 1-1 entering the third period, the Islanders took the lead on a short-handed goal by Nelson at 4:49. Noah Dobson banked a pass off the left-wing boards from his own end to send Nelson on a breakaway. Daccord stopped Nelson's initial shot but the Islanders forward shoveled his own rebound in the net. The Kraken wasted little time in tying it back up as McCann scored at 5:26. Andre Burakovsky got the puck along the right-wing boards at center ice, spun and fed McCann, who had gotten behind the defense. McCann beat Sorokin with a wrist shot from the slot to extend his point streak to five games (four goals, three assists). The Kraken opened the scoring at 8:10 of the first period. Tanev, who scored four goals over the previous three games, took the puck behind the net and came back out on the left wing, spinning to his forehand for a sharp-angled shot. The puck hit Gourde, stationed at the far post, just below his neck guard and dropped over the goal line. The Islanders tied it at 13:38. Daccord stopped Ryan Pulock's blistering slap shot from the high slot but Engvall got his stick between the feet of Kraken forward Oliver Bjorkstrand to knock the rebound into the net.

Allen finished with 23 carries for 109 yards, Jackson Meeks caught a touchdown pass and Trebor Pena chipped in 11 catches for 97 yards for the Orange (7-3, 4-3 ACC). Syracuse had dropped two of its previous three games. The Bears (5-5, 1-5) had won two in a row entering Saturday, but Fernando Mendoza threw two early interceptions and the Cal defense couldn't get enough stops. Mendoza finished 22 of 34 for 225 yards with a late touchdown, while Jaydn Ott ran 11 times for 78 yards and a score. Syracuse dominated the first quarter, outgaining Cal 117-29 en route to a 6-0 lead. Jackson Kennedy kicked two of his four field goals in the quarter, and both of Mendoza's picks were in the first as well. Mendoza's second interception set up the first touchdown of the game -- a 30-yard run by Allen that made it 13-0 early in the second quarter. However, the Bears didn't need much time to answer. Jaivian Thomas took off untouched for a 75-yard touchdown on the second play of the ensuing drive to get the hosts within 13-7. The visitors had their own answer, though, as they marched 75 yards in nine plays, capped by Allen's 1-yard scoring plunge. Then following a Cal punt, the Orange embarked on another scoring drive. McCord found Meeks for 6 yards on fourth-and-3, and then the duo connected again on the next play for a 6-yard touchdown pass. Cal missed a 48-yard field goal on the final play of the first half, but the Bears dented the scoreboard midway through the third quarter on Ott's 15-yard touchdown run, making it 27-14. The Orange countered with Kennedy's 43-yard field goal -- the team's sixth straight scoring possession to open the game. Kennedy's 32-yard field goal with 3:12 left in the game essentially sealed the deal.

Oregon is coming off an 80-70 overtime win over in-state rival Portland on Tuesday. The Ducks trailed by as many as 13 in the second half and were down 11 with less than five minutes left in regulation before rallying. It wasn't a solid performance for the Ducks, who looked better in wins over California-Riverside and Montana. The Pilots took advantage of the Ducks' cold shooting and defensive miscues to take the lead and hold it for much of the game. Pacing the Ducks' comeback, Jadrian Tracey provided energy and offense off the bench with 19 points and four steals, and Keeshawn Barthelemy was clutch down the stretch, scoring 11 of his 13 points in the last four minutes of the second half. ""Those first 36 minutes were probably the worst 36 minutes we've played all season, honestly, including myself,"" Barthelemy told the Register-Guard in Eugene. ""Defensively, we didn't impose our will, we gave up a lot of easy baskets, we messed up a lot of switches, we were just too cool to care at that point. It was probably really obvious from the naked eye."" Troy (2-1) of the Sun Belt Conference posted wins over Toledo and New Orleans before a 65-49 loss at No. 18 Arkansas on Wednesday. The Trojans led the Razorbacks 27-26 at halftime but couldn't sustain the defensive effort in the second half ""First half, we were locked in and did a great job executing. When the defense is down on our end, it's a little easier to help our guys out,"" head coach Scott Cross told the school's athletics website. ""Second half, we just turned the ball over and didn't have the same grit and toughness defensively. We didn't do the little things we normally do."" Jackson Fields leads Troy in scoring at 12.7 points per game. He had a team-high 13 against Arkansas. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

As good as Novak and Campos were to reach 16-under par for the tournament, Wesley Bryan was one shot better in the third round amid a steady wind to tie the tournament record with a 10-under 61. Bryan moved up 42 spots into sole possession of fourth place at 13 under. Second-round leader Justin Lower (68) was alone in third place at 15 under. Novak shot a 7-under 29 on the front nine, birdied two of the first five holes after the turn and cruised home with four consecutive pars. Campos birdied each of the last four holes in the front nine and three of the last four on the back nine for his 62. ""Luckily, we had not much wind early and so I was able to get a nice rhythm going early in the round,"" Novak said. ""We really didn't start feeling much wind until about the sixth hole and by then I'm 5 under through six. So I picked up a little bit then and carried some momentum (into) some downwind holes and was able to take advantage of that."" Novak and Campos, each seeking their first PGA Tour victory, delivered their lowest round of their careers. Novak is making his 85th start, while Campos is in his 80th start. Not only is Campos trying to earn his PGA care for the 2025 season, he is playing after his wife gave birth to the couple's daughter this week. ""I held my daughter (and) I thought about in like 20 minutes I had to go to the airport,"" Campos said. ""I do want to provide for them as much as I can, so we're here and fortunate.  Everything went well and we got our flights in and we were able to get here on Thursday morning and make our tee time. Obviously, it's a bonus that I'm doing well this week."" Campos was equal parts dreading the windy conditions, while also embracing them after he won on the Korn Ferry Tour in 2019 on a windy day. ""It was very windy today, especially at the end, but it does give me confidence,"" Campos said. ""The harder it gets, the better it is for me, I believe. I have to admit I'm not the best ball-striker, but I can move my way around the course trying to keep trajectories down and all those things."" Lower was tied for the lead with one hole to play in the third round but his tee shot at No. 18 found the penalty area and he finished with a bogey 5. He shot 1-over 36 on the back nine, with a bogey 5 at No. 11 and a birdie at the par-5 No. 17. ""I was fuming pretty good there after the tee shot (at 18) and going up to the drop and whatnot, but just like I'm still playing well, still have a chance,"" Lower said. ""My caddie did a good job keeping me in it."" Lower considered the wind unplayable late in his round. ""I think if a top-10 or top-15 player in the world was here and they wanted to stop, I think the rules officials would have said, ‘Yeah, we'll stop,'  "" he said. ""... If we would have said ‘I don't feel comfortable playing in this,' we would have been told 'tough' and to proceed with the round. So that's how I feel about it."" Bryan now shares the tournament record low round with Taylor Pendrith (second round, 2021) and Alex Noren (first round, 2022). His 29 on the back nine tied a tournament record, and he had two eagles Saturday to give him three in the tournament. His memorable round came after a long night. ""I'll be honest, woke up this morning on very, very little sleep,"" Bryan said. ""Stayed up for the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson (boxing) match and that didn't finish until about, shoot, 2 in the morning. It was one of those spectacle events that I just felt I needed to watch."" A group of three tied for fifth place at 12 under included Lucas Glover (66), Troy Merritt (66) and Sam Ryder (68). Glover and Merritt moved up five spots Saturday, while Ryder dropped one spot. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It was supposed to be a pass to Mgbako, who sealed his defender, but the ball sailed over the top of the defense and into the hoop.   South Carolina took an early 4-0 lead, but the Hoosiers responded with a 14-0 run that culminated with a Rice jumper at the 14:34 mark of the first half. An Ugusuk 3-pointer cut the Gamecocks' deficit to 20-17 with 8:31 remaining in the first half. Indiana was able to push its lead back to double figures at 35-24 on a Mgbako layup.

""A lot of ugly stretches. Pretty clear that I didn't have these guys ready to play. Put the responsibility on me. I've got to do a better job of getting these guys prepared. It was embarrassing. There were two stretches where our fans booed, and rightly so. I was ashamed to hear that, but they were right."" One of the most surprising aspects of Friday's game was the performance by Heat forward Kevin Love, who scored all 15 of his points in the third on 6-of-8 shooting, including 3-of-4 from beyond the arc. The 36-year-old Love added seven rebounds, four steals and two assists in just 12 minutes. Love has started the last three games but could move back to a reserve role when Butler returns.

Klubnik dropped back to pass and took off at midfield zig-zagging and then sprinting up the field for the longest touchdown of the game. The Panthers (7-3, 3-3) had 76 seconds and two timeouts to respond, but their potential game-winning drive ended on fourth-and-1 at the Clemson 26-yard line when Nate Yarnell's pass was intercepted by Khalil Barnes.

Jalon Moore also had 21 points and five rebounds as the Sooners (3-0) remained unbeaten thanks to two big surges in each half, which helped stave off the resilient Hatters (1-3), who dropped their third in a row. After falling behind early in the game, Oklahoma used a 23-2 run in the first half to open up an 18-point lead. But Stetson, which was led by Abramo Canka's 22 points on 8 for 12 shooting, would not go away easily. The Hatters cut the deficit to 51-43 with 14:01 left with an 8-0 run sparked by sharp shooting by Canka and Jordan Wood, who finished with 11 points and two assists. Duke Miles (six points, four assists) snapped the run with a corner triple. Elvis and Moore then sparked another big run as the Sooners scored 16 unanswered points to put themselves ahead 70-46 with 7:39 left in the second half. While Stetson's 3-point shooting (9 for 24) kept it in the game, turnovers were the major detractor. And Oklahoma took advantage, turning 23 Hatters giveaways into 31 points. Elvis and Sam Godwin each had three steals to lead the effort for Oklahoma on the defensive end. Godwin also had a game-high 10 rebounds and the Sooners collected 15 offensive rebounds. Jeremiah Fears also had 11 points, three rebounds and three assists for the Sooners. Oklahoma also shot 9 for 24 from 3-point range and totaled 21 assists while only turning the ball over 11 times. Stetson's Josh Massey suffered a bloody nose after he collided with the back of the head of teammate Alex Doyle with 2:50 left in the first half and played only 13 minutes. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Penguins' Juwan Maxey made two 3-pointers to cut the deficit to two. Jaquan Carlos missed two foul shots for Syracuse, setting up Harper's game-tying free throws with seven seconds to play.

The game was tied at 64 when Galette drained a 3-pointer with 2:38 remaining in regulation. Lampkin and Freeman answered with buckets for the Orange, however, as Syracuse slipped ahead 68-67 with two minutes left.   Farmer, meanwhile, was doing everything he could on the other end. He made a jumper on the Penguins' next trip and added two foul shots shortly thereafter to keep the visitors ahead 71-70 with 56 seconds to play in the second half.   Galette and Starling traded big shots down the stretch in regulation, with Galette converting a layup with 14 seconds remaining and Starling tying it up with his jumper six seconds later, sending the game to overtime.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Aidan Armenta had 89 yards on 8-of-15 passing. With starting quarterback Thorne returning from a shoulder injury, Auburn went 60 yards on its first series and counted on Coleman, who caught three passes on the eight-play drive. He broke a tackle on the final one and dashed 20 yards at 10:57.  Auburn kicker Ian Vachon made his first attempt for the Tigers, a 22-yarder with 5:21 remaining in the first quarter. On its best drive of the day, Thorne and the Tigers used 16 plays to travel 99 yards in 7:34 to make it 17-0. The quarterback capped the possession with a 3-yard TD lob to Coleman.

Radek Faksa registered a goal and an assist, Nathan Walker also scored and Alexey Toropchenko dished out two assists for St. Louis, which had been in an 0-3-1 rut -- including a 3-2 home loss to Boston on Tuesday. St. Louis had a 31-17 shots-on-goal advantage, holding Boston to no more than six in any regulation period. Jordan Binnington made 15 saves.  Playing against his hometown team, Trent Frederic scored both Boston goals. Korpisalo stopped 28 shots on goal for the Bruins, who have dropped back-to-back games (0-1-1) following a 2-0-1 run. Walker brought the Blues even with 10:42 left in regulation and forced the extra session, burying a wrister from above the right circle after receiving a low-to-high pass from Faksa. Faksa gave the Blues a 1-0 lead at 6:25 of the first period, tipping Scott Perunovich's shot from just inside the blue line. The initial game-tying goal came from Frederic at the 9:34 mark, as he buried a rebound after Georgii Merkulov tipped Charlie McAvoy's pass down low from the point.  Merkulov's primary assist marked his first NHL point in his fifth career game. Frederic netted his second goal of the period only 2:38 later, redirecting Mason Lohrei's drive from the left point while screening Binnington at the net front.

It's another thing","The Phoenix Suns know they need to revive their offense to break out of their skid.   But it's one thing to know you need to score. It's another thing to actually do it.   The Suns will look to bounce back from their lowest-scoring game of the season when they visit the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday afternoon in Minneapolis.   Phoenix has lost back-to-back games and three of its last four, including a 99-83 road setback against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday night. The Suns shot 29.3 percent (22 of 75) overall and 24.3 percent (9 of 37) from beyond the arc.   ""We played great defense,"" Suns veteran Royce O'Neale said. ""Offensively, we missed a lot of shots, especially wide open.""   Phoenix coach Mike Budenholzer agreed.   ""We've probably got to play a little bit better offensively,"" he said. ""That's the great thing about playing great teams and great defenses. They test you. They make you learn what you've got to work on, how you've got to be better.   ""We'll learn from (Friday night) and be better.""   The Timberwolves hope to keep the Suns searching for answers.   Minnesota returns home after a disappointing road trip that included two straight losses against the Portland Trail Blazers, followed by a 130-126 overtime win against the Sacramento Kings on Friday.   Anthony Edwards scored a team-high 36 points on 14-for-27 shooting to lead the Timberwolves to their latest victory. Julius Randle scored 26 points and Rudy Gobert notched a double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds.   ""This game was super important,"" Edwards said. ""I'm glad we were able to come out with the win.""   The Timberwolves feature five players who average double digits in scoring.   Edwards leads the group with 28.4 points per game on 46.8 percent shooting from the field. Randle is next with 20.6 points and Naz Reid is contributing 15.4 points in about 25 minutes off the bench.   Gobert (10.8 points) and Jaden McDaniels (10.1) round out the top five.   Phoenix is without top scorer Kevin Durant, who is averaging 27.6 points but is sidelined by a calf injury. Fellow veteran Bradley Beal, who is third on the team with 17.8 points, also is dealing with a calf injury.   That leaves the bulk of the scoring responsibility to Devin Booker, who ranks second with 22.5 points on 42.3 percent shooting from the floor. Booker struggled against Oklahoma City on Friday, when he was held scoreless in the first half and finished with 12 points on 2-for-10 shooting.   ""They put two people on him pretty much every time he had it,"" Budenholzer said. ""There was a ton of attention on him.""   This is the Suns' first visit to Minnesota since last season's first-round playoff series between the teams. The Timberwolves swept the Suns 4-0 in the best-of-seven Western Conference quarterfinals.   Minnesota posted home victories against Phoenix by margins of 120-95 and 105-93 to open the series. The teams then traveled to Phoenix, where the Timberwolves recorded victories of 126-109 and 122-116 to secure a trip to the conference semifinals.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The game was the first for the two programs as league foes since 1990 when they were a part of the now-defunct Southwest Conference. The intensity still was high as the Longhorns (9-1, 5-1 SEC) stayed on track for a spot in the SEC Championship game in their inaugural season in the conference.    Up 10 points with 9:05 to play, the Longhorns forced a fumble and then held on to the ball over the final 6:55 to secure the victory, their third straight after a lone loss at home to Georgia on Oct. 19.   Jaydon Blue rushed for 83 yards on 13 carries as Texas outgained the Razorbacks 315-238 in total yards during the victory.   Arkansas quarterback Taylen Green had 149 yards passing but absorbed six sacks for 48 yards in losses and threw an interception for the Razorbacks (5-5, 3-4).    The Longhorns struck first, moving 61 yards in six snaps to a 20-yard Ewers-to-Golden TD pass midway through the first quarter. Texas added to its lead with a 39-yard field goal by Bert Auburn at the 11:15 mark of the second quarter .   Texas' defense dominated the first half, holding the Razorbacks to just 74 total yards while recording four quarterback sacks and six tackles for a loss. Arkansas crossed midfield just once, and then to just the Texas 46.   The Longhorns extended their advantage to 13-0 on Auburn's 33-yards field goal on their opening possession of the third quarter.    Arkansas finally responded, moving 75 yards in 12 plays to a Ja'Quiden Jackson 1-yard TD plunge to make it 13-7 with 3:39 to play in the third. The Razorbacks more than doubled their prior offensive output on the scoring march.   Matthew Shipley's 44-yard field goal with 12:48 remaining at the end of a 10-play, 39-yard drive culled the Arkansas deficit to just three points.   Ewers then found Golden on a nifty 1-yard touchdown pass to stem the Arkansas tide and re-establish the Longhorns' 10-point lead. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The second-seeded Spirit will face either the Orlando Pride or Kansas City Current in the title match. Those squads meet Sunday. Third-seeded Gotham was the defending NWSL champion. Gotham goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger had nine saves prior to the shootout while Kingsbury stopped four. Hatch began the shootout by sending a right-footed shot into the top right corner of the net. Kingsbury then easily saved Gonzalez's right-footed attempt. Silano was up next and sent a right-footer into the wide-open right portion of the net. Gotham's McCall Zerboni's right-footer was then stopped by Kingsbury. McKeown then sent a right-footed grounder into the lower left corner for Washington's third shootout tally. Gotham then faced do-or-die and Jenna Nighswonger's left-footer was gobbled up by Kingsbury to end it. Earlier, Gotham took a 1-0 lead in the 56th minute as Yazmeen Ryan delivered a left-footed cross toward the center of the box. Gonzalez then sent a header toward the right corner that trickled into the net. Things looked bleak for the Spirit as the seven minutes of second-half stoppage time began. But Nighswonger was called for a yellow card for a rough foul to give Washington a free kick. Makenna Morris took the kick and delivered a solid pass toward the center of the box and Hershfelt rose to head the ball into the left corner of the net to tie it. Gotham played with just 10 players for the last 19 minutes of extra time after Bruninha knocked down Trinity Rodman at the sideline. Bruninha was given her second yellow card of the game with the automatic elevation to red. Three minutes later, Rodman set up Hatch for an opportunity in front of the net but Hatch's left-footed shot was saved by Berger.

That possession ended in a three-and-out, and Horvath was done for the day. His only pass was an incompletion, and he had 25 yards on five rushes.   Hughes, who began the day fourth in the FBS with 1,209 yards rushing, finished with 82 yards on 22 carries. He capped a 65-yard drive to open the third quarter with a 1-yard scoring run to extend Tulane's lead to 21-0.

Three plays later, Mensah scrambled up the middle for a 14-yard touchdown and a 7-0 lead.   Navy tried to answer, converting a fourth-and-1 at the Tulane 44 on its next possession. But on a fourth-and-3 at the 35, the Green Wave's Caleb Ransaw broke up a 5-yard pass play that would have yielded a first down.   Tulane then marched 65 yards on 11 plays, chewing up more than six minutes, and capped by Hughes' 14-yard touchdown run. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Lausch was 21-of-35 passing for 201 yards with Bryce Kirtz making seven catches for 92 yards. Ohio State responded by going 85 yards in 12 plays with Judkins going in from the 1 to make it 7-7. The Buckeyes soon made it 14-7 thanks to blocking a Northwestern punt after a bad snap to get the ball at the 1. Two plays later, Judkins again scored from the 1. Ohio State extended the lead to 21-7 with 47 seconds left in the half on a 25-yard catch by Tate from Will Howard (15-of-24 passing for 247 yards). Howard's passing success was complemented by the running of Judkins (76 yards) and TreVeyon Henderson (74).   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Tennessee (3-0) is vying for its second straight 4-0 start following three convincing victories. Last time out, the Volunteers followed up a 22-point win at Louisville with Wednesday's 92-57 home drubbing of Montana. Tennessee led by just seven early in the second half before pulling away for its largest margin of victory this season. Charlotte transfer Igor Milicic Jr. led the way with 18 points and 10 rebounds, while Felix Okpara, Chaz Lanier and Cameron Carr each chipped in 13 in the Volunteers' balanced scoring effort. Milicic, who also tallied five assists, upped his season scoring average to 11 points per game, third on the team behind Lanier's 16.7 and Zakai Zeigler's 14.3. ""Igor can handle and shoot the ball, and he showed that,"" Tennessee head coach Rick Barnes said. ""But he changed his mindset tonight. I thought he made good plays as opposed to thinking he's got to score every time the ball is in his hand. I thought he played with flow, made some really good passes. We thought his versatility was the biggest thing he could bring to our team."" A key in Tennessee's last two wins has been its edge on the glass, as the Volunteers have outrebounded Louisville and Montana by a combined total of 78-43. ""(Rebounding) is a big part of what we talk about in our program,"" Barnes said. ""It's a major emphasis for us and it's a compliment to the players, because it's not an easy part of the game. It's something that takes determination and fight to do it. ... It's important. You can't be a great defensive team if you can't finish with a rebound, and you don't want to be a one-and-done offensive team either."" Barnes and Tennessee hope the advantage continues Thursday, when the Volunteers take on Virginia in the first round of the Bahamas Championship. Tennessee will play either Baylor or St. John's in the next game. Before that, Austin Peay comes to Thompson-Boling Arena in Knoxville in hopes of its second upset this year. The Governors (3-0) won at Butler 68-66 on Nov. 8, before beating Chattanooga 67-61 at home on Monday. LJ Thomas leads Austin Peay with 19.7 points per game, followed by Sai Witt's 12. Witt, a Preseason All-ASUN Conference first-teamer, recorded 17 points and eight boards in Monday's victory over the Mocs. ""Sai is a force to reckon with,"" Austin Peay head coach Corey Gipson said. ""He is great at working angles. He does his work early. When he is playing against defenders that don't do their work early, they have to pay. I don't think you can guard him in one-on-one coverage, and teams are starting to double him, but since we have such good spacing, he is savvy enough to play inside-out."" Austin Peay is 1-10 all-time against Tennessee, with its one victory a 74-70 upset in December 2011. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Dayvion McKnight supplied 13 points and Zach Freemantle notched 11 for the Musketeers (4-0).  Xavier received its stiffest test in four home games to begin its schedule but outscored the Demon Deacons by 30-15 from beyond the 3-point arc. Hunter Sallis led Wake Forest (4-1) with 16 points and Davin Cosby, boosted by three 3-pointers, added 13. Tre'Von Spillers provided eight points and nine rebounds for the Demon Deacons. Wake Forest, playing in its first true road game, was charged with 18 turnovers. Conwell shot only 5-for-14 from the field, but he knocked down four shots from 3-point range and he also went 7-for-8 on free throws. He's in his first season with the Musketeers and matched his point total from the season opener. Xavier collected 12 offensive rebounds, with Freemantle gathering three of those.

Take away Cosby, and they were a combined 2-for 10 on 3s. Wake Forest, which trailed for stretches in the second halves of its previous two games in narrow triumphs against Michigan and USC Upstate, stayed within range at 50-44. A three-play play from Freemantle pushed Xavier's lead to 61-46 with 6:40 to play. Cosby posted five straight points for Wake Forest in a bid for a comeback, closing the gap to 64-53 before a pair of Conwell free throws at the 5:16 mark. After holding a 12-point edge, Xavier led 34-24 at halftime.  The Musketeers were held to three points for almost the first four minutes after halftime before Conwell's 3-pointer.

That's what this young basketball season has been like for the Miami Hurricanes (2-0), who on Sunday will host the Coppin State Eagles (0-5). In Miami's opener, Fairleigh Dickinson swarmed Hurricanes players who even thought about shooting a 3-pointer. As a result, Miami attacked the rim, tying a school record for shooting percentage (66.7) while cruising to a 113-72 win. Center Lynn Kidd, making his Miami debut, scored 24 points on 10-for-11 shooting. In Miami's second game, Binghamton double-teamed Kidd repeatedly. As a result, Kidd was held to just six points, but starting guards Nijel Pack and Jalen Blackmon scored 17 each. ""We're versatile on offense,"" Pack said. ""We have so many weapons. Our offense, as long as we continue to keep getting better each game, with our defense, and continue to learn, we should be set."" Indeed, Pack (19.0 ppg), Blackmon (16.0) and Kidd (15.0) are Miami's leading scorers. Pack also leads the team in assists (5.5), and Blackmon is No. 1 in 3-point percentage (60.0). Miami's other top veterans are Brandon Johnson (8.5 points, team-high 8.0 rebounds) and Matthew Cleveland (9.0 points, 5.5 rebounds). Two freshmen also have been impressive for the Hurricanes, as Divine Ugochukwu and Jalil Bethea are both averaging 11.0 points per game. Pack and Blackmon both played high school ball in Indiana. Yet, they had never played on the same team until this season, when Blackmon transferred in from Stetson. Blackmon said the quality of players around him this season has improved his game. ""I find it a lot easier when you're playing with such good players that can make plays for you and you can make plays for them, so I don't have to take as tough shots,"" he said. ""I can get easier shots and can help other guys get easy shots as well."" Meanwhile, Coppin State is coached by Larry Stewart, a former NBA forward.

Two years later, he became the first undrafted player to make the NBA's All-Rookie team. As for his players at Coppin State, they have been clearly outmatched. So far this season, for example, Coppin State has just one player averaging in double figures as a scorer: Derrius Ward, a 6-6 shooting guard. Ward, a fifth-year senior, is on his fifth college team.

Jenkins was one of two scorers in double figures on either side in a game where both offenses failed to get out in transition and often ate up clock time on each possession. The teams combined for only 12 fastbreak points. Yacine Toumi chipped in 12 points and seven rebounds for the Pirates (2-2), who held the Seahawks to 23.9 percent shooting from the field and 16.7 percent shooting from 3-point range. Seton Hall connected on 45.5 percent of its shots overall, including 8 of 18 attempts from long range (44.4 percent). Wagner (1-3) got eight points and five boards from Javier Ezquerra and seven points from Ja'Kair Sanchez. After Keyontae Lewis cut the Seahawks' deficit to 26-16 with a layup to open the second half, Seton Hall turned the game into a rout by scoring 20 of the next 24 points to make it 46-20 with 8:57 to play. Dylan Addae-Wusu, Isaiah Coleman and Jenkins each drained a triple during the Pirates' back-breaking run. Seton Hall never let the lead dip below 21 the rest of the way. Wagner grabbed a 7-2 lead 4:34 into the game, but the Pirates dominated the rest of the first half. Toumi made a pair of layups and knocked down a 3-pointer to highlight a 12-2 run that put Seton Hall up 14-9 with 10:20 remaining until halftime. Sanchez responded with a three-pointer before the Seahawks went cold and allowed the Pirates to break the contest open. The visitors experienced a scoring drought that lasted 9:28, finally breaking through when Ezquerra hit a jumper with 28 seconds left in the first half.

With a victory, the Chiefs might as well consider themselves 12-0, as the Carolina Panthers and Las Vegas Raiders await them in Weeks 12 and 13, respectively. Kansas City will be tested down the stretch due to meetings with the Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Denver Broncos, but it has already downed two of those teams this season, so we still like its chances. And oh yeah, the Chiefs’ game on Dec. 15 against the Cleveland Browns? That’ll be a win, too. Running back Isiah Pacheco won’t be back this week for Kansas City, but he’s nearing a return after fracturing his fibula in Week 2. Wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins has also been a seamless fit in the offense, hauling in 12 receptions for 142 yards and two touchdowns over the past two games. The Chiefs are somehow only getting better. Knowing that perfection is very much within reach for Kansas City is a hard pill to swallow. We hear about this team more than enough on a weekly basis, and mainstream media seemingly hasn’t said a bad word about it in almost 10 years. Just imagine what we’d be force-fed if the Chiefs became the first team to complete an undefeated regular season since the New England Patriots did so during the 2007 campaign. One can only wonder how the league would tie Travis Kelce’s relationship with Taylor Swift to the 17-0 record. Well, if Buffalo doesn’t win on Sunday, we’re all bound to find out. Of the teams Kansas City still has to face, the Bills have the best shot of tagging the Chiefs with their first loss in our eyes. The Chargers are on a three-game winning streak, but all three victories came against low-level competition; the Texans have been on a steady decline for nearly a month, the Broncos don’t have the experience to get the job done, and we’d imagine the Steelers will fade at some point with Russell Wilson under center. Pittsburgh has to, right? Have no fear, though, NFL fans. No matter how the Chiefs finish the regular season, they won’t be going all the way in the playoffs. No team has ever managed to win three Super Bowls in a row, and that’s not going to change this season. You could even argue that going 17-0 might hurt Kansas City in the long run. Sure, the Chiefs are battle-tested and have proven that they have what it takes to win on the league’s biggest stage, but we don’t know how they’d respond to the added pressure of following up an undefeated campaign with another championship. At the end of the day, taking home the Lombardi Trophy is what really matters. That New England team back in 2007 had 18 wins and just one loss—the Super Bowl—and that one loss made it get lost in history. And the Chiefs might find themselves in that same predicament if they put too much emphasis on chasing perfection. Copyright 2024"

Barmore was diagnosed with blood clots in July and returned to practice on Thursday. He is questionable to play on Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams in Foxborough, Mass. Also on Saturday, ESPN reported the Patriots were releasing wide receiver Tyquan Thornton. Barmore, 25, signed a four-year, $83 million contract in April. The 6-foot-5, 315-pound Barmore paced the Patriots with a career-high 8.5 sacks in 17 games (six starts) last season, also setting career highs in tackles (64), quarterback hits (16) and pass breakups (six).

The Hoosiers are 10-0 for the first time in their history. They never won 10 games in a season before this one, either, and they are fifth in the College Football Playoff rankings. The new contract averages $8 million a year and includes an annual $1 million retention bonus. He initially signed a six-year, $27 million contract when he was hired on Nov. 30, 2023.  His new pact brings his salary more in line with the highest-paid coaches in the Big Ten, where Lincoln Riley at Southern California and Ryan Day at Ohio State earn just more than $10 million annually. ""After first meeting Coach Cignetti, we were very confident that he was the perfect fit for what we were trying to build with our football program,"" athletic director Scott Dolson said. ""We were confident IU could become a winning program and we love what he's building here. We love the student-athletes that he's bringing here. We love how our fanbase has rallied around this team and made Memorial Stadium the place to be on Saturday afternoons. And now, we love the fact that he's going to be doing all those things right here in Bloomington for a long, long time."" Cignetti, 63, replaced Tom Allen, who was fired after a 3-9 overall record and a 1-8 mark in the Big Ten last season. His teams were 33-49 in seven-plus seasons and finished above .500 in the Big Ten just twice. The Hoosiers are 7-0 in the conference this season. Idle Saturday, they travel to No. 2 Ohio State next Saturday for a highly anticipated Big Ten showdown. ""(Wife) Manette and I love Bloomington and are grateful for how the IU community has embraced us,"" Cignetti said. ""I look forward to leading this outstanding program and doing my part to continue the momentum for Hoosier football."" Cignetti came to Indiana after leading James Madison to an 11-1 record in their second season at the FBS level in 2023. He was named Sun Belt Coach of the Year. Indiana ranks second nationally in scoring offense (43.9), seventh in scoring defense (13.8), 16th in total offense (453.2) and third in total defense (255.5). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Unbeaten through three games and coming off its first win as a ranked team in nearly a decade, No. 22 St. John's will host New Mexico on Sunday afternoon in New York in the fourth coaching matchup between Rick Pitino and his son Richard Pitino.  Rick Pitino is 2-1 against his son. The Red Storm (3-0) are starting a week when they not only face New Mexico, but 12th-ranked Baylor on Thursday in the Baha Mar Hoops tournament in the Bahamas/ St. John's might face 11th-ranked Tennessee or Virginia in that event.  St. John's is coming off three wins in its on-campus arena in Queens over Fordham, Quinnipiac and Wagner by a combined 76 points. ""New Mexico is probably the No. 1 offensive-pace team in the country, and I know it better than anybody,"" Rick Pitino said after the Red Storm earned their first win as a ranked team since Dec. 28, 2014.  ""So we've got to get ready for this pace. They've got a great guard, they've got great support players, they've got a terrific inside player. This is a tough, tough test.""  The first three games featured moments when the Red Storm struggled, especially during Wednesday's 66-45 win over Wagner. St. John's scored 18 straight points to pull away in the final 10 minutes. The Red Storm shot 50 percent from the field (21 of 42) but took 13 fewer shots than Wagner and missed 12 of 30 free throws. RJ Luis Jr. scored 13 points as St. John's top scorer, but Aaron Scott made three key shots during the decisive run and added 11. Scott made his key contributions after sitting out against Quinnipiac on Nov. 9 with an illness and tweaking his ankle in practice ahead of the Wagner game. ""We did our job against these three teams,"" Rick Pitino said. ""Now it's really going to get tough."" Pitino changed the starting lineup by having Kadary Richmond come off the bench along with Zuby Ejiofor, but both could return to starting on Sunday. New Mexico (3-0) received 15 points in this week's Top 25 poll and is seeking its second win over a ranked opponent this season. The Lobos knocked UCLA out of this week's poll by beating the then-No. 22 Bruins 72-64 on Nov. 8. New Mexico is attempting to start 4-0 for the second time in three seasons after earning a 100-81 home win over Texas A&M Corpus Christi on Tuesday, when the Lobos forced 22 turnovers following forcing 21 against UCLA.  Donovan Dent, who is averaging a team-high 19 points a game for the Lobos, totaled 25 points and 10 assists and continued his improvement from his sophomore season. Dent averaged 14.1 points on 52 percent shooting from the field but last season but is shooting 58.8 percent in 2024-25. ""It was a good win for our guys,"" Richard Pitino said. ""I thought they were ready to go. When you have a big win like UCLA, everyone is telling them how great they are. Then you have another big game against St. John's coming up. I thought the mental approach was terrific to handle their business against (Corpus Christi)."" Besides Dent's big showing on Tuesday, Kayde Dotson added 18 points and Tru Washington 15.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

McIlroy, of Northern Ireland, needs to finish in the top 11 of the tournament to capture his sixth season crown. McIlroy will enter the final round of the DP World Championship in Dubai on Sunday in a three-way tie for first place, sitting at 12-under after shooting a 68 on Saturday. Tied with McIlroy are third-round leader Antoine Rozner of France (69) and Dane Rasmus Hojgaard, who rode six birdies on the front nine to a 66 at Jumeirah Golf Estates. McIlroy mixed six birdies with two bogeys on the round, but couldn't capitalize on any birdie opportunities after the 12th hole, recording pars the rest of the way. ""After the birdie on 12, you know, I had a good chance,"" McIlroy told reporters after the round. ""I hit a really good shot into 13 and just caught the edge. And then 14 and 15 are birdie holes, and not being able to birdie either of those, and only with a 6-iron in my hand going into the last green and not making birdie there, as well. ""A little disappointed how I played those last five holes, but still obviously in a really good position heading into tomorrow."" One person who wasn't disappointed was Hojgaard, who picked up six strokes on the field early with six birdies on the front nine. He was three strokes off the lead entering play Saturday, then three ahead as he made the turn. And at the par-5 No. 18, he saved what appeared to be a sure bogey -- or worse -- with a par-saving putt. He said he'll approach the final round the same way that he did on Saturday. ""Try not to worry too much of what's ahead of me. Try and play one hole at a time and see if I can get the best score possible out of that hole, just like 18,"" Hojgaard said. ""So yeah, I think that's my target for tomorrow, try and keep the bogeys away."" Rozner, who entered the round with a one-stroke lead, will enter play Sunday with some momentum after an eagle at No. 18 kept him atop the leaderboard. ""I think the eagle on last helped me big time. I'm happy with my day overall,"" Rozner said. ""I didn't produce my best golf of the week so far but I was always hanging in there. I managed to hole a couple putts on the back nine that were big for me."" Chasing the leaders on Sunday will be Sweden's Jesper Svensson, whose 68 tied him with Joaquin Niemann of Chile (69) two shots back at 10-under. England's Tyrrell Hatton (71) is alone in sixth place, three shots off the pace, and Tom McKibbin of Northern Ireland and Japan's Keita Nakajima sit at 8-under. All eyes are likely to be on McIlroy as he tries to win the tournament and the season championship in the same season for the third time. ""It's a great opportunity to end the year on a really high note,"" he said. ""Going to go out there tomorrow and give it everything I can and hopefully things fall my way and I'm able to stand on that 18th green with both trophies."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Bettors have the rest of Week 11 ahead of them, but they don't have to settle for the traditional betting line if they don't want to. No, each game comes with a healthy menu of player props. Bettors can choose from over a thousand player props for the Sunday games. The following is a list of our top 10 player props for NFL Week 11 (in no particular order). NFL Week 11: Player Props Green Bay Packers vs. Chicago Bears Jordan Love, O/U 32.5 passing attempts at -102/-128 (FanDuel) Opponents have averaged just over 30 attempts per game against the Bears this season and just over 27 in the last three. Why so few? Because foes don't need to throw on the Bears. Once teams get out to a sufficient lead, they lean heavily on the run to run time off the clock. That's what the Patriots did when they beat the Bears last week, as did the Cardinals the week before. Love has exceeded 32.5 attempts in four of his seven starts this season, including two of his past three. But don't count on him to do it again, as the Packers will do like everyone else when they play the Bears and lean on the run game. Take the UNDER. Cincinnati Bengals vs. Los Angeles Chargers Joe Burrow, O/U 265.5 passing yards at -115/-115 (DraftKings) Burrow widely is regarded as one of the better passers in the NFL. Anyone who watched him throw for 428 yards last week vs. the Ravens will probably agree with that sentiment. However, there are a couple of things working against Burrow going OVER this total. For one, the Chargers have a solid pass defense that is allowing just 191.6 yards per game. While Burrow is averaging 267.2 passing yards per game, take away his two ridiculous outings against the Ravens, and his average is 231.5 yards per game. Take the UNDER. Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Baltimore Ravens George Pickens, O/U 68.5 receiving yards at -120/-110 George Pickens, longest reception, O/U 26.5 yards at -135/+100 George Pickens, O/U 4.5 Reception made at -130/+100 George Pickens, 75+ Receiving Yards at +110 *Odds via BetMGM The Ravens can't defend against the pass (league-worst 294.9 yards allowed per game). It's been well-documented and evident whenever they play a competent quarterback. Russell Wilson appears to be one once again, and he has done a great job connecting with George Pickens on deep balls. In Wilson's three starts, the veteran quarterback hit Pickens with a long of 44, 43 and 34 yards. No one gives up more 20-plus-yard receptions than the Ravens (47). Wide receivers are averaging nearly 200 yards a game against the Ravens. If Wilson targets Pickens eight times, he will make at least five catches and almost certainly will go OVER 68.5 yards, if not 75+ as well. Unless the Ravens suddenly figure out how to defend against the pass, Pickens will have a career day. Take the OVER for each prop. Lamar Jackson, O/U 43.5 rushing yards at -127/-108 (Caesars) Jackson has gone over this number in seven of 10 games this season but not in his past two. Against the Steelers, he will face one of the best run defenses in the game (No. 4, 87.1 ypg allowed). But they are not just good at stopping running backs. Pittsburgh is quite good at containing running quarterbacks. The Steelers' defense is one of the best at keeping quarterbacks from scrambling. Quarterbacks are running on 1.5 percent of dropbacks, the lowest rate in the league. If Jackson sets his mind to it, he would clear 44 yards against the Steelers D, but they don't need him to. That's what they signed Derrick Henry for, so someone other than their quarterback can run for the tough yards. Take the UNDER. Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Detroit Lions Amon-Ra St. Brown, O/U 76.5 receiving yards at -105/-115 (DraftKings) Jared Goff, O/U 228.5 passing yards at -113/-113 (FanDuel) Jahmyr Gibbs, O/U 15.5 rushing attempts at +100/-130 (BetMGM) Bonus: Jahmyr Gibbs, O/U 69.5 rushing yards at -113/-113 (FanDuel) St. Brown has gone over this total just twice this season, vs. the Buccaneers in Week 2 and the Vikings in Week 7. The Jaguars do not have a defense that can contain him, but don't count on him to go OVER 76.5 yards. Why not? The Lions will not need him to. Detroit is a massive favorite in this game. Once the Lions get a comfortable lead, the offense will focus more on running the ball and eating up the clock. That is also why Goff will probably not go over 228.5 yards passing, a number he has gone over once in his past three games. Take the UNDER for both. As for Gibbs and his rushing attempts, he has gone over 15.5 carries just twice this season as he is in a committee with David Montgomery. (They both have 122 carries heading into this game). Thus, Gibbs is getting 13.6 attempts per game, so he would need at least two more to hit the OVER. Assuming the Lions do lean on the run in the second half once the game is in hand, he would get closer to 20 carries and closer to 90-100 yards than 69.5. Take the OVER on both. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Fox was 22 of 35 from the field and 6 of 10 from 3-point range in a 130-126 overtime loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night. ""I would've rather us gotten the rebound in the fourth and me not even get 60,"" Fox said. ""It's definitely cool, but obviously, I definitely wanted to get the win."" Fox moved into the franchise record book by surpassing Jack Twyman's 59 points for the Cincinnati Royals on Jan. 15, 1960. Sacramento rallied from a 20-point deficit in the third quarter despite playing without Malik Monk (right ankle) and DeMar DeRozan (lower back tightness), who missed his first game of the season. Fox engineered the Kings' comeback by scoring 39 of his 60 points after halftime. ""He's an All-Star, and the sky is the limit for him,"" Sacramento coach Mike Brown said. ""He knew we needed help, and he put us on his back, and he almost carried us to the finish line, but he did everything in his power and it was a spectacular performance by him."" The Kings also received another strong outing from center Domantas Sabonis, who recorded his 12th straight double-double with 23 points and 12 rebounds. Keegan Murray added 14 points and 10 rebounds. Sacramento will aim for its sixth straight win over Utah. The Kings won the first meeting this season on Oct. 29, when Sabonis finished with 28 points and 11 rebounds in a 113-96 victory. Utah has won three of its past five games, including 115-113 over the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday. John Collins scored 28 points and Jordan Clarkson added 20 for the Jazz, who recorded their first home victory of the season after Collins scored with 6.4 seconds remaining. ""Tonight isn't about the Xs & Os piece, it was about the mental and physical toughness that the team showed,"" Jazz coach Will Hardy said. ""It felt really, really good to battle through a tough moment and pull out a win here at home."" Rookie Kyle Filipowski is quickly emerging as a key building block for Utah, which took the 6-foot-11 forward with the 32nd pick in this year's NBA draft. Filipowski is expected to make his second straight start on Saturday in place of Walker Kessler, who is out due to hip bursitis. Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen is listed as questionable with an eye contusion. Filipowski has totaled 32 points on 13-of-19 shooting from the field over his past two games, but Hardy was most impressed with his defense against Dallas star Luka Doncic on Thursday. ""I think Doncic picked him a lot to isolate, and I thought that Kyle was fantastic,"" Hardy said. ""Luka is one of the hardest players in the league to guard in isolation, and I thought that Kyle did a really good job of moving his feet, using his body, bracing up for contact and really not being sloppy with his hands and fouling."" Hardy also has been pleased by the play of Collins, who is averaging 21 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 3.3 assists in six games this month. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The best bets for Week 12 dive into a trio of games featuring teams currently in position to reach the inaugural 12-team College Football Playoff. Week 12’s biggest game pits sixth-ranked Tennessee against No. 11 Georgia, with the Bulldogs possibly fighting for their Playoff lives. The stunning 28-10 loss at Ole Miss in Week 11 has put Georgia's back against the wall. There’s value in taking Tennessee on the moneyline: FanDuel offers the 9.5-point underdog Vols at +270 to win straight up, while DraftKings has Tennessee ending its six-game losing streak to Georgia at +295. For those not confident in a Tennessee outright win, Tennessee at -105 (FanDuel, BetMGM) to cover the 9.5-point spread is worth a look—particularly in light of the factors that make the 46.5-point under a smart bet. At 12.6 points allowed per game, the Vols are holding opponents to the fifth-lowest yield in the FBS. They’re allowing 0.3 points per game fewer than the Ole Miss defense that gave Georgia fits a week ago, including holding Alabama’s 38.1-point-per-game offense to just 17 points. No opponent has scored more than 19 points against Tennessee, which came in the Vols’ lone defeat. That 19-14 setback against Arkansas highlighted the weaknesses in the Tennessee offense that might make bettors hesitant about taking the Vols to win outright—particularly against a talented Georgia defense allowing just 18.4 points per game. But with the Bulldogs having had their own offensive struggles against Kentucky and Ole Miss, two of the best defenses they’ve faced this season, Saturday’s contest should be an old-school, low-scoring SEC grind, no matter which side wins.

Undefeated BYU comes into its Week 12 matchup with the Jayhawks having won five one-possession games, including last Saturday’s wild 22-21 comeback victory over rival Utah. Kansas, meanwhile, is 0-4 in one-score games after taking its rival and another Big 12 Playoff hopeful, Kansas State, to a 29-27 final on Oct. 26. Each team’s tendency to play close games may have contributed to the opening line of BYU -7 plummeting to the Cougars being favored by less than a field goal. Kansas is better than its 3-6 overall record suggests, and the Jayhawks should give BYU another competitive game. However, KU has struggled on the road—the Jayhawks are 0-4 away from Lawrence this season—and Lance Leipold’s team may struggle to limit BYU’s passing offense as effectively as Utah did last week. Jake Retzlaff went just 15-of-33 for 219 yards against Utah, with a season-low 6.6 yards per attempt. Utah’s defense is holding opponents to fewer than 50 percent completions with just 10 touchdowns allowed on the season. Kansas heads into Provo ranked No. 89 nationally against the pass, allowing 233.4 yards per game with a completion percentage yield greater than 60. Expect a more efficient Cougars offense against the Jayhawks, and a bit more breathing room in a BYU win than it had a week ago as Kalani Sitake’s team moves one win closer to the Playoff.

Ashton Jeanty, however, was impressive, breaking 200 rushing yards for the fourth time this season. His three touchdowns also marked his fifth outing with at least three scores. As the Boise State running back looks to become the first Heisman Trophy winner from a non-Autonomous Five conference since BYU’s Ty Detmer in 1991, look for his production to increase down the stretch. That starts with Saturday’s visit to San Jose State, a surprising 6-3 team with a slim but realistic chance of reaching the Mountain West Conference Championship Game. San Jose State’s rushing defense has been stout, holding opponents to just 3.7 yards per carry. But SJSU has also been giving up points—31 or more in four of the last six contests. While reaching the 200-yard milestone again may be a tough ask of Jeanty, Boise State should have scoring opportunities. That means Jeanty will see plenty of chances to punch it into the end zone and continue building his Heisman resume.

The Mavericks head home for the battle with their Lone Star State rivals after dropping a 115-113 setback to the Utah Jazz on Thursday. Naji Marshall misfired on a corner 3-pointer at the buzzer for the Mavericks, who have four consecutive losses by a combined eight points. ""Poise, calmness is a big thing and we're not there yet,"" Dallas coach Jason Kidd said. ""With a new group, that could be an issue early on, but there's no better way to go through it than being able to play close games and learn from your mistakes and also learn from being able to win games.  ""It's the small details. If we can clean up some of these little things on these plays, that puts us in a better seat."" Luka Doncic led all scorers with 37 points in the loss. Marshall scored 19 points, Klay Thompson had 17, Quentin Grimes added 15 and Daniel Gafford had 10 for the Mavericks, who played without Kyrie Irving (strained right shoulder). Dallas was down by 14 points after three quarters and charged back, going up by two with 1:33 remaining to set up the furious finish.  ""It's adversity, man,"" Marshall said. ""That brings out the best in people. We're going to run through a wall facing this adversity and get better. Later on in the season as we made the right changes, we'll look back on this and see how far we came."" The Spurs head north for the second game of a home-road back-to-back set after a 120-115 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday. The contest was the first in NBA Cup group play for both teams. Victor Wembanyama paced the Spurs with 28 points and 14 rebounds and Stephon Castle added 22 points. Devin Vassell had 15 points, Keldon Johnson hit for 12 and Chris Paul collected 11 points and 11 rebounds for San Antonio, which saw its two-game winning streak come to a halt. Vassell, who missed nine months with a broken foot, still is coming off the bench under a minutes restriction as he works his way back into the starting lineup.  ""I'm not tripping about it as long as we are winning and playing well,"" Vassell said of his reserve role.   San Antonio was down by just a possession when Castle was forced to settle for a contested, step-back 3-pointer with 12 seconds left that was rebounded by the Lakers. San Antonio still has yet to win an NBA Cup game after going 0-4 last year. The Spurs could have backup guard Tre Jones back in the fold for Saturday's game. Jones has been out since Oct. 26 with an ankle injury. ""I would hope sometime very soon. I'm not sure if it's (Saturday) or Tuesday, but I would suspect very, very soon,"" Spurs interim coach Mitch Johnson said Friday. Dallas beat the Spurs in the teams' first matchup this season, 120-109 at home on Oct. 24.  The teams won't play again until back-to-back games March 10 and 12 in the Alamo City. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

They will face the host Los Angeles Kings on Saturday less than 24 hours after squandering a two-goal lead late in the second period in a 6-4 setback to the Ducks in Anaheim.   The Red Wings saw a 3-1 lead go away after the Ducks scored four unanswered goals, the final two of them 38 seconds apart midway into the third period. Alex DeBrincat scored on the power play with 3:44 left to pull Detroit to 5-4, but an empty-net goal clinched the victory for Anaheim.  ""This is back-to-back games where we had really good starts. We built leads and we got away from it,"" Red Wings coach Derek Lalonde said.  Detroit led 2-0 in the second period in Pittsburgh on Wednesday but had to go to overtime to get a 3-2 win.  Marco Kasper scored his first NHL goal and added an assist, and DeBrincat and Lucas Raymond also scored and set up a goal Friday. Three of the Red Wings' goals came on the power play, giving them 11 with the man advantage in their last 10 games. Alex Lyon made 23 saves for Detroit, but Cam Talbot likely will get the start in goal Saturday. The Kings are coming off a fruitless two-game road trip, losing 3-1 to the Calgary Flames on Monday and 4-2 to the Colorado Avalanche on Wednesday.   Adrian Kempe scored both goals on Wednesday, and Trevor Moore and captain Anze Kopitar each had two assists. ""They pushed, and we didn't do a very good job handling it,"" Kings coach Jim Hiller said. ""I thought, for whatever reasons, once we got into the second period, we had a really tough time connecting on passes. Turning pucks over because we just couldn't get ourselves out of the D-zone.""  Goalie Darcy Kuemper (undisclosed) and defenseman Caleb Jones (upper body) left Wednesday's game with injuries and were placed on injured reserve on Friday.  Kuemper made 20 saves before departing 4:34 into the third period. David Rittich, who replaced Kuemper, will start in goal Saturday. Defenseman Drew Doughty (broken ankle) and forwards Alex Turcotte (upper body) and Arthur Kaliyev (broken collarbone) remain out with long-term injuries. Los Angeles recalled goaltender Erik Portillo and defenseman Jacob Moverare from the Ontario Reign of the American Hockey League. Forward Tanner Jeannot is eligible to return to action Saturday after serving a three-game suspension for his hit on Vancouver Canucks forward Brock Boeser on Nov. 7. Alex Laferriere leads the Kings with nine goals while Kopitar has club-best totals in assists (15) and points (20). Kempe is tied with Kevin Fiala with seven goals to go with 16 points.   Raymond's 16 points (two goals, 14 assists) lead the Red Wings, DeBrincat is next with 15 (seven goals, eight assists), and captain Dylan Larkin has 12 points, including a club-best nine goals. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Next, they will try to halt the Los Angeles Lakers' four-game winning streak as both teams look to sweep back-to-backs Saturday night in New Orleans.  The Pelicans had lost six in a row and nine of 10 amid a rash of injuries before recording a 101-94 win over the visiting Nuggets, who played without three-time league MVP Nikola Jokic (personal reasons).  ""It's a credit to all of our players, the character in our locker room,"" Pelicans head coach Willie Green said. ""I'm asking these guys to do so much. They're giving it everything they got in practice and film.  ""Our whole staff has been super supportive and together, and everybody's working as hard as they can to go out on the floor and be as good as we can be, but also working to get guys back on the floor. So, really good win for us, especially trying to weather this storm.""  Brandon Ingram had 29 points, nine rebounds and seven assists in 37 minutes against the Nuggets. The Lakers selected him with the second overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft, and he spent three seasons in Los Angeles. ""He has been big-time for us,"" Green said of his team's leading scorer. ""Who knows where we would be without him on the floor right now. His contribution night-in and night-out has been at a super high level.  ""He's been seeing double teams, triple teams, picking him up full court, trying to wear him down and he's handling all of this with grace and he's been super supportive with his teammates. He's minimizing the frustration out there and he's doing a great job of leading.""  Brandon Boston Jr. scored 19 points and Trey Murphy III added 17 to supplement Ingram's scoring.  In Jokic's absence, New Orleans out-rebounded Denver 56-38, including 17-5 in offensive rebounds. Rookie center Yves Missi led the way for the Pelicans with a game-high and season-high 12 rebounds.  LeBron James had his career-high fourth consecutive triple-double (15 points, 16 rebounds and 12 assists) and Anthony Davis had a double-double (a season-high 40 points on 14-of-26 shooting and 12 rebounds) in the Lakers' 120-115 win at San Antonio on Friday.  In addition to the two stars, Los Angeles had four other players score in double figures. Austin Reaves scored 19, rookie Dalton Knecht had 14, D'Angelo Russell 13 and Max Christie 11.  ""It was big time for our team knowing that we can execute down the stretch,"" James said. ""It doesn't always have to be just the ball in my hands and we isolate or whatever the case may be.""  Davis, who is averaging a career-high 31.1 points and has scored 30 or more points in seven of 11 games, noted the significance of the Lakers winning for the second time in six road games this season.  ""We want to be just as good of a road team as we are a home team,"" said Davis, who played his first seven NBA seasons with the Pelicans. ""And we can't do that if we don't come out and compete.  ""We've just been a different team when we've been out on the road. The way we compete, share the ball, play together at home, is totally different than when we (go on the road).

Struggling Pittsburgh is coming off a 6-2 loss at the Columbus Blue Jackets on Friday night and will play its next five games at home. Anthony Beauvillier collected a goal and an assist and Michael Bunting also scored on Friday for the Penguins, who have lost three straight games and five of their last six (1-3-2). ""We're looking for (consistency), obviously,"" Pittsburgh superstar captain Sidney Crosby said. ""We've got to commit to play the same way. That's not always easy to do. There's a lot of things that can affect that. We can't allow anything to change the way we play."" Crosby, who had an assist on Friday, remains two goals shy of 600 for his career. Beauvillier extended his goal streak to three games and is tied with Crosby and Rickard Rakell for the team lead in goals (six). Tristan Jarry returned from a stint at Wilkes Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League to work on his game. He made 33 saves in his first start since Oct. 16. Bunting's goal tied the game 2-2 in the second period before Columbus pulled away in the third. ""You look at a couple of the goals they score, they're outside shots where the rebound lays there,"" Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. ""We're either puck-watching or we don't get into people. We got to be harder at our net front, and we got to make 'em work harder for those types of goals."" Pittsburgh defenseman Kris Letang missed the game due to illness. Meanwhile, forward Matt Nieto played 13:26 and had one shot on goal in his first NHL game since Nov. 30, 2023. He had reconstructive MCL surgery on his left knee in May after undergoing laparoscopic surgery to his right knee in January. The Sharks fell to 1-1-1 on their road swing after dropping a 3-2 decision at the New York Rangers on Thursday. The game started well for San Jose as defenseman Timothy Liljegren scored his first goal of the season at 2:51 of the first period to give the Sharks a 1-0 lead. But the second period belonged to the Rangers, who scored three times, once after Chris Kreider intercepted Mackenzie Blackwood's backhand pass along the boards that ultimately led to Mika Zibanejad scoring the tying goal. ""We mismanaged some pucks, and a good team like that will make you pay,"" Sharks coach Ryan Warsofsky said. ""We didn't do that in the first, and that's why we had success. But we mismanaged pucks, soft puck play, and it's in the back of our net."" The Sharks were outshot 16-6 in the second period and 11-4 through the first 10 minutes of the third. Fabian Zetterlund scored a power-play goal with 26 seconds remaining to pull the Sharks within 3-2. Blackwood finished with 32 saves. ""Did a lot of good things in this game,"" San Jose's Alexander Wennberg said. ""There are parts of it that you want to learn from. But we made a push at the end. Obviously, it wasn't enough.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It will be the first of four games at home for the Canadiens, who are coming off a four-game trip in which they were outscored 17-11 while going 1-3-0. Seven of Montreal's goals came in a 7-5 win against the Buffalo Sabres on Monday. That victory snapped a six-game slide for the Canadiens, who followed with a 3-0 loss to the Minnesota Wild on Thursday. The Canadiens are 3-9-2 since winning two of their first three games of the season. ""We're not in the business of being happy with losses,"" defenseman Mike Matheson said after the game against the Wild. ""Teams that are high in the standings find a way to win."" Montreal sits last in the NHL's overall standings with 12 points through 17 games. It's been a struggle at both ends of the ice. The Canadiens have more than three goals only five times thus far, winning four of the games, and more than half of the team's 46 goals have come largely from three players. Cole Caufield is tied for second-most goals in the league with 12, which leads the team. Brendan Gallagher is second with seven, while captain Nick Suzuk  follows with six. Suzuki enjoyed a four-point effort (two goals, two assists) against the Sabres, his only points over the past six games. Juraj Slafkovsky has scored once and not since Oct. 14, though his 10 assists are tied for second on the team behind Suzuki (11). Kirby Dach also remains stuck on a single tally, last scoring on Oct. 26, and has just two assists - both against Buffalo - in his past eight games. ""We had a good effort (against Minnesota), but at the same time, we have to convert on our chances,"" Matheson said after the most recent loss. Not helping matters is the puck going in at the other end. Montreal has allowed 70 goals, second-most in the NHL. Only the Pittsburgh Penguins (77) have given up more. The Blue Jackets, meanwhile, head north of the border looking to build off a 6-2 win against the Penguins on Friday that snapped a six-game slide (0-5-1). The Blue Jackets have only 14 points in 16 games. ""Now we have that win,"" said goalie Elvis Merzlikins, who played Friday, ""we have that winning mentality back on and we have to keep going."" Daniil Tarasov is expected to start in goal against the Canadiens. He will aim to pick up his first win since Oct. 22, when he backstopped Columbus to a 6-2 triumph against the Toronto Maple Leafs. He's 0-2-1 in his three appearances since. Before Friday's offensive outburst against Pittsburgh, the Blue Jackets had just 11 goals in six games in November. ""The frustrating part on the whole is that we're playing extremely well in a lot of areas, we're outplaying teams in a lot of areas, and we're not getting the results,"" Columbus coach Dean Evason said before the game. ""That's a positive end of it, but we're a results league. We're not satisfied with where we're at, and we don't want to get into a position where we're accepting losing."" Forward Mathieu Olivier scored his first goal since Oct. 28 in Friday's win, tying his career high with five goals on the season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It will be the second game in as many nights for Toronto, which is coming off Friday night's 99-95 loss against Detroit in the second NBA Cup game for each team. The loss extended Toronto's overall losing streak to six games. Toronto's Jakob Poeltl had 25 points and 18 rebounds, but the Raptors dropped to 0-2 in NBA Cup play.   ""We depend on (Poeltl) a lot,"" Toronto coach Darko Rajakovic said. ""He needs to do a lot for us offensively and defensively. ... When he is connected with his teammates he's able to score, but also find his teammates. I think he's making huge strides for us.""   Toronto's RJ Barrett added 22 points in Friday's loss. Gradey Dick scored 16 but was 1 of 10 from 3-point range. Boston hasn't played since it beat Brooklyn 139-114 Wednesday night. Jayson Tatum had 36 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds in the win. Boston also received 24 points and 12 rebounds from Jaylen Brown and 23 points from Payton Pritchard. The 139 points were the most the Celtics have scored in a game this season. Boston scored 74 points in the second half. That victory came one night after Boston lost 117-116 to Atlanta at home. The Hawks prevailed even though Trae Young, the team's leading scorer, didn't play because of right Achilles tendinitis. ""As far as our attitude and our bounce-back, I thought that was important,"" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. ""There's going to be ebbs and flows throughout the season. I care more about how we respond to things when they don't go our way, and I liked the approach that we had to the game today on both ends of the floor."" Boston committed 20 turnovers against the Hawks, who had a 19-6 advantage in offensive rebounds. The Celtics turned the ball over seven times and had a 12-3 edge in offensive rebounds against the Nets. ""Back to back, obviously heavy legs and stuff like that,"" Brown said after the Brooklyn game. ""It took a little bit to get settled into the game, but great adjustment, great response. It was just about being physical, being tough and embracing that.""   Tatum, at an average of 30.2 points a game, and Brown (25.4) are Boston's leading scorers this season. Tatum also leads the team in rebounds (7.6) and steals (1.5). Brown is second on the team in rebounds (7.2) and is tied with Pritchard for second in steals (1.2) ""It starts with them taking responsibility as far as what needs to be done on the floor,"" Mazzulla said. ""So they played at a high level on both ends of the floor. Defensively, their communication, the accountability on their individual defense. Then offensively, taking the shots that they want to take and getting the ball where it needs to get to.   ""So it's a credit to them, and they know how important two-way basketball on both ends of the floor is for our success."" For the Raptors, Barrett is averaging a team-high 21.4 points a game, and Poeltl is first in rebounds at 11.6.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

He also chipped in six rebounds and two steals in 30 minutes. Another freshman for Rutgers (3-0), Dylan Harper, added 20 points, six assists and five rebounds.

Fifita completed 20 of 35 passes for 224 yards for the Wildcats (4-6, 2-5 Big 12), who never trailed and went up 27-3 on Quali Conley's 50-yard touchdown run late in the third quarter. Conley had scored on a 13-yard reception earlier in the quarter. Houston (4-6, 3-4), which entered the game third-to-last nationally in scoring (15.2 points per game), committed three turnovers and turned the ball over on downs four times, including on fourth-and-goal from the 1 in the second quarter and on a fake punt near midfield in the third quarter. Loop ended the first half with his 62-yard field goal, breaking the Arizona record of 57, held by four players. Loop added a 51-yard field goal in the third quarter. Conley finished with 107 yards on 11 carries. Tetairoa McMillan caught six passes for 70 yards and a touchdown.

Carolina went 1-2-0 on a road trip that ended Wednesday with a 4-1 loss to the Utah Hockey Club. The Hurricanes fell despite attempting a season-high 50 shots, but they left Salt Lake City with an even bigger concern. In that game, Hurricanes goalie Pyotr Kochetkov left midway through the third period. Coach Rod Brind'Amour told reporters afterward that the 25-year-old Russian got ""banged up"" earlier in the game. Kochetkov did not dress for practice on Friday, and Brind'Amour said he doubted the netminder could play Saturday, although the team did not immediately make a decision to call up a substitute. Kochetkov has an 8-2-0 record with a 2.56 goals-against average. He had been playing the majority of the games since Frederik Andersen went down with a lower-body injury late last month, and it's uncertain when Andersen will return. ""We were hoping it was going to be week-to-week, but now it's going to be, I would say, way longer,"" Brind'Amour said Friday. ""Let's just leave it at that."" Should Kochetkov be unavailable, then Spencer Martin likely would get the start on Saturday. Aside from replacing Kochetkov on Wednesday, the 29-year-old has started only one game this season, a loss to the Colorado Avalanche on Nov. 9. Overall, he has allowed six goals on 31 shots. Those are not the only injuries Carolina must overcome. Forward Seth Jarvis missed the games in Las Vegas and Utah with an upper-body injury, and the 22-year-old, who logged 33 goals and 34 assists last season, may not return to the ice until sometime next week. The Hurricanes, who had won eight straight games before the three-game trip, have been carried by Martin Necas in the first month. The 25-year-old center leads the team with 16 assists and 25 points, and he and Jack Roslovic share the team lead with nine goals. Necas enters play Saturday with a career-best 11-game point streak during which he has eight goals and 14 assists. Ottawa saw its modest two-game winning streak end Thursday with a 5-4 overtime loss to the visiting Philadelphia Flyers. The Senators led 4-2 midway through the third period before giving up two goals in a span of 2:03. Matvei Michkov netted the game-winner for the Flyers with 55 seconds left in the three-on-three extra session. Even though the Senators squandered a late advantage, coach Travis Green had few qualms with how his team played. ""We've been playing well here for three games, and you hate to lose a game like that where you dominated in a lot of areas for most of the night,"" Green said. The Senators, whose 16 power-play goals are tied for fourth in the league, converted on 2-of-6 chances with the man advantage against the Flyers. Tim Stutzle, who leads the team with 21 points, tallied an assist. The 22-year-old left winger has recorded at least one point in five of his past six games and in 13 of 16 contests this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The second-year player will draw plenty of attention as many of his family and friends are expected to be in attendance, judging from all the requests for tickets. ""Nothing crazy, but I'll be paying to play for a day,"" he said, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Bedard, the 2023 first overall draft pick and last season's Calder Trophy winner as rookie of the year, missed his team's lone visit to Vancouver last season due to a broken jaw. A return to his hometown might spark the 19-year-old forward. In 17 games this season, Bedard has netted only three goals and 13 points. He has just one assist in his past four games and hasn't scored a goal in the past eight games. ""Lately, I've just been less of an impact and not really making a difference,"" he said this week, according to The Hockey News. ""Hopefully, I can contribute more."" The Blackhawks are coming off a 3-1 loss to the Seattle Kraken on Thursday and have managed only one victory in their past four games. Chicago was outplayed through the first two periods but stayed within striking distance until a late empty-net goal sealed its fate. Yet nobody was kidding themselves. ""It's disappointing,"" Chicago forward Nick Foligno said. ""We talked about it. They start fast, too, and we just didn't have an answer for that, and that's disappointing. ""I guess you could say our legs were there in the third. We were hanging around, hanging around, the game was almost waiting for us to take it over, and we just didn't."" The Canucks are back in action after yet another lackluster performance at home. After their 5-2 loss to the New York Islanders on Thursday, Vancouver has managed only two wins at home (2-3-3) yet has won six of seven road games. The Canucks scored first against the Islanders but surrendered five consecutive goals, which left Vancouver coach Rick Tocchet apologizing to the fans. ""We're not playing good enough at home. It's on me,"" Tocchet said. ""Guys played light (Thursday). I thought we were ready to go. We weren't. It's on me."" Whether the coach or the players deserve the most blame is a debate, but something must change soon.  Even with Dakota Joshua returning to the lineup after being diagnosed with testicular cancer in the summer and 2022 first-round draft pick Jonathan Lekkerimaki opening the scoring, his first NHL goal in his second career game, the Canucks faltered and have now lost two of three games to kick off a six-game homestand. ""We're going to lose games. We can't win all 82, so it's normal to lose games,"" defenseman Vincent Desharnais said. ""But it's not normal to lose games like we're doing right now. We're letting our goalies down. We're not playing to our standards right now. We have a big stretch of games coming, and we've got to figure it out."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Evgenii Dadonov made a penalty shot in the Stars' latest victory. It marked his fourth successful penalty-shot goal in five attempts in his career. ""That shows you how deep our team is,"" Stars forward Tyler Seguin said. ""He can't crack the top couple of shootouts. We might need to get him out there."" Kirill Kaprizov leads the Wild with 30 points (10 goals, 20 assists) in 16 games. Matt Boldy ranks second on the team with 17 points (10 G, 7 A) in 16 games. The Stars' top scorer is Matt Duchene, who has 20 points (9 G, 11 A) in 15 games. Mason Marchment is second with 15 points (4 G, 11 A) in 14 games. Seguin, who is fourth on the Stars with 13 points (7 G, 6 A) in 11 games, picked up two assists in the Stars' most recent game against the Bruins. ""This is a hard league to score in -- and to score at the rate he's scored at,"" Stars coach Peter DeBoer said. ""I like the way he's getting his points right now. He's just playing honest."" Wild goaltender Filip Gustavsson is expected to make the start Saturday against Dallas' high-scoring attack. Gustavsson is 8-2-2 with a 2.08 goals-against average and a .924 save percentage this season, and is coming off a shutout victory against the Montreal Canadiens on Thursday night. In four career games against Dallas, Gustavsson is 3-1-0 with a 1.73 GAA and a .950 save percentage. The Stars are expected to counter with Jake Oettinger in net. The 25-year-old Oettinger, who grew up in nearby Lakeville, Minn., is 8-3-0 with a 2.39 GAA and .914 save percentage. Oettinger is 5-0-1 with a 2.49 GAA and .913 save percentage in eight career appearances against the Wild. Minnesota coach John Hynes said he is pleased with what he has seen so far from his team. ""We're playing a strong, connected team game,"" Hynes said. ""We're playing connected in all areas of the ice, obviously our defensive zone through the neutral zone. I think our offensive-zone game, we're playing as a five-man unit. ""The guys are paying attention to details of the structure that you need."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Fox scored with 39 seconds left to tie the game at 115, and the game went to overtime after McDaniels' 3-point attempt missed the mark at the buzzer. After shooting 7 of 39 (17.9 percent) from 3-point range in a 106-98 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, Minnesota shot 20 of 49 (40.8 percent) from beyond the arc in Friday's victory. Domantas Sabonis recorded his 12th straight double-double with 23 points and 12 rebounds for Sacramento. Keegan Murray added 14 points and 10 rebounds.

Paul (11-1, 7 KOs) finished with an 78-18 edge in punches connected against the 58-year-old former world champion. With Paul clearly ahead, the final round turned into a victory lap. A smattering of boos could be heard throughout the arena as both men embraced one another before the judges' decision was announced. Round 1 saw a quick pace from both men. While there were clinching sessions at times, Paul got the better of the exchanges but didn't stun Tyson. The second round was similar, but Tyson's volume began to pick up. Paul started throwing more power shots, but Tyson remained in survival mode again. Heavy, deep breaths began to set in as a crowd of 65,000 looked on. Paul's most dominant round was the third. A right-hand, left-hook combination stunned Tyson and put him on wobbly legs. It was unclear whether Paul's gas tank was emptied, but Paul had the upper hand despite finishing 1-for-11 on power shots. The pace slowed in the fourth round, but Paul kept the pressure on Tyson, who couldn't provide volume in return. Round 5 saw Tyson fight more conservatively. It didn't faze Paul, as he kept firing off left hooks and right hands. Tyson's chin held up well, but it didn't translate to a faster pace, let alone a potential knockout. Tyson was visibly slower in the sixth round, taking several Paul shots. The seventh round was more of the same as the sixth. Tyson gasped for air as Paul picked intelligent shots. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Blake Coleman also scored for Calgary, which has only one regulation loss in its last six games. Goalie Juuse Saros stopped 31 shots for the Predators, who have only one win in their last seven games. Miromanov finally opened the scoring at 6:38 of the third period with his first goal of the season. After Nazem Kadri cleanly won an offensive-zone faceoff to the point, Miromanov headed down the right wing for a pass from MacKenzie Weegar, after which he lifted a top-shelf shot to snap a 22-game goal-scoring drought. Coleman secured the victory by potting an empty-net goal with 69 seconds remaining in regulation, his fourth tally of the campaign. The low-scoring affair was between a pair of clubs who are struggling offensively, but the goaltenders did a strong job of keeping the puck out of the nets. Saros was especially key when he denied Matt Coronato late in the second period. He denied Coleman during a two-man breakaway shortly after Calgary opened the scoring. Wolf was the busier of the two twine-minders in terms of high-danger chances. The rookie NHLer who twice was named the AHL's top puck-stopper showed he was up to the challenge from the start. In the first period, he robbed Steven Stamkos and then both Cole Smith and Gustav Nyquist on bang-bang chances in the middle of the opening frame. Wolf also blanked Jonathan Marchessault midway through the second period. The Flames won despite failing to convert on a 117-second five-on-three advantage late in the second period, during which they managed only a single shot on net.

""It's obviously not our best,"" Sanheim said of the win over Ottawa. ""I think any time you can get two points out of not playing a good hockey game, you'll take it and move on. We'll get ready for a homestand that we've got to be good at. It's learning lessons, areas we need to be better at."" Ivan Fedotov recorded the win for the Flyers, but the team will likely turn back to Samuel Ersson in net against a Buffalo team that enters with plenty of momentum. The Sabres were down a goal against the St. Louis Blues with less than eight minutes to play Thursday when Alex Tuch's equalizer sent the game to overtime. Rasmus Dahlin's deciding goal sent the fans home happy. Buffalo earned their first overtime win of the season despite playing without leading goal scorer Tage Thompson and starting goalie Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen. Both missed the contest and are considered day-to-day with undisclosed injuries. ""Good response,"" Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. ""Again, you've got to be able to overcome tough moments."" Ruff was particularly pleased with the way Ryan McLeod (one goal, one assist) raised his game with Thompson, whose 11 goals are tied for sixth in the NHL entering Friday, out of the lineup. ""I thought he stepped up the way we needed,"" Ruff said. ""It was the next man's opportunity, and he took advantage of it."" The Sabres will hope for more of that in Saturday's matchup against a team following a similar path in the opening months of the season. ""It was not pretty today, but we found a way,"" Dahlin said after beating St. Louis. ""That's what good teams do. I think it was a really mature game by us. So, I'm really happy about the effort by everybody."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The contest is the first of a home-and-home series between the teams. They'll face off again in Winnipeg on Tuesday night.  The Jets saw their seven-game winning streak come to an end with a 4-1 loss to the host Tampa Bay Lightning on Thursday. That marked the first road loss of the season and just the Jets' second of the season through 17 games. ""End of the day, they were on a mission and they were not going to let us get into our game, and that's a good lesson for us,"" Jets coach Scott Arniel said of the Lightning. ""We know how we have to continue to play, we know what helps us have success, and just get back to it."" Captain Adam Lowry scored in the second period on Thursday to trim Winnipeg's deficit to 3-1. But the Jets couldn't find the net again and saw their franchise-best seven-game road winning streak snapped as well. Kyle Connor, who leads the team in goals (11) and points (22), was held off the scoresheet for the fourth time in his last five games. Mark Scheifele and Gabriel Vilardi saw their respective eight-game point streaks come to an end on Thursday. Winnipeg defenseman Josh Morrissey, who leads the team in assists (15), is expected to play in his 600th career NHL game on Saturday. ""Every time you get another 100 games, it's a cool moment,"" Morrissey said on Friday. ""It's cool to be coming up on 600. It goes by fast. You hear everybody say that. A lot of great memories, and it feels like I'm just getting going."" Like the Jets, Florida has endured a bit of turbulence after a stellar start. The Panthers had won a season-high seven in a row before dropping 4-1 and 6-2 decisions to the New Jersey Devils, both games in Sunrise. ""We haven't loved our last two,"" Florida head coach Paul Maurice said following Thursday's loss. ""You are not going to love them all."" Sam Reinhart scored in both contests, giving him eight goals in his last eight games and a team-leading 13 for the season. He also has 13 points (eight goals, five assists) during his nine-game point streak. Captain Aleksander Barkov extended his point streak to seven games (two goals, 11 assists) on Thursday but was in no mood to celebrate. ""In both games, they played really good offensively and we couldn't get our offense going at all,"" Barkov said. ""We're not happy at all with the past two games, especially this one. We just have to learn from it and move on."" Barkov added that the defending champions won't underestimate the Jets. ""We know who's coming into town, the best team in the league right now playing unbelievable hockey,"" Barkov said. ""We got to be ready right away."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After reaching the milestone Thursday night by cooling off the Winnipeg Jets, the NHL's hottest and best club, the goaltender will likely start again at home searching for No. 301 on Saturday night against the visiting New Jersey Devils. Tampa Bay never trailed in the 4-1 win against Winnipeg, a team that had won its previous seven games and outscored opponents 33-12 in that span. The Lightning kept the best power-play unit in the NHL scoreless in five tries and did so without top center Brayden Point, who missed his third consecutive game with a lower-body injury. Captain Victor Hedman moved into second place on the franchise's all-time assist list, dishing out No. 583 and inching him within five of legendary playmaker Martin St. Louis' 588. Anthony Cirelli scored his 100th career goal and Brandon Hagel netted one in his 200th game wearing a Lightning jersey. But the night belonged to Vasilevskiy, the backstop the club affectionately calls ""The Big Cat,"" who became the fastest player to reach the victory total in NHL history.  The 2019 Vezina Trophy winner did it in 490 career games, 31 fewer than previous record-holder Jacques Plante.  ""How do you become the best?"" said Lightning coach Jon Cooper, whose club broke a four-game losing streak. ""You are put in the big moments at the big times and you deliver time and time again. ""To do what he's done and get 300 wins in the time he accomplished that, along the way winning the Vezina and two Stanley Cups and participating in four Finals, I'm not sure what else you could say about the man."" After a 1-0 home loss to the San Jose Sharks on Sunday, New Jersey headed on a three-game road trip in Florida. In a rare two-game stop against the same team in three days, the Devils defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers 4-1 on Tuesday and 6-2 on Thursday. New Jersey has won five of its past six games, including four road matchups, ahead of its matchup in Tampa on Saturday. In the two wins against the Panthers, the Devils took early leads before pulling away. Jacob Markstrom, who was selected in the second round in 2008 by Florida, starred in goal Tuesday, making 34 saves. Jesper Bratt recorded his second career hat trick Thursday after his two-assist performance in the first win over the Panthers. ""We won the (first game) by playing really, really good defensively and capitalized on our chances,"" Bratt said after his three-goal outing. ""We took a little more command of the game offensively (tonight). We played a little more with the puck and had more time in the (offensive) zone. ""I think we took a step as a group and built some character. We're playing another really good team (in Tampa)."" Tampa Bay won the last matchup between the teams, earning an 8-5 victory in New Jersey on Oct. 22. The Lightning have won eight of the past nine games in the series.  After their game Saturday, the teams will complete their season series Jan. 11 in New Jersey. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The 23rd-ranked Aggies (3-1) won their third consecutive game since a season-opening loss at UCF. The 21st-ranked Buckeyes (2-1) took their first defeat of the season in their second matchup with a Southeastern Conference opponent. Ohio State beat Texas in its season opener on Nov. 4. Bruce Thornton scored 15 points to lead the Buckeyes, but Ohio State buried itself early after abysmal shooting in the first half. Dealing with an aggressive Texas A&M defense, Ohio State shot an awful 7 for 32 (21.9 percent) in the first half and missed 12 of their first 17 shots. The Buckeyes did make 5 of 17 three-pointers to keep the Aggies from running away with the game by intermission. Texas A&M shot only 6 for 25 (24 percent) in the first half. But the Aggies' aggressiveness on offense made a huge difference as they continually earned trips to the free-throw line, and made them count. For the game, Texas A&M made 32 of 40 shots from the line, which doubled the amount of makes for Ohio State, which made 16 of 22. The Buckeyes led only once in the game, when Thornton opened the scoring with a 3-pointer. The Aggies scored the next 12 points and never looked back. Zhuric Phelps finished with 14 points, four rebounds, three assists and two steals for Texas A&M. Henry Coleman III had 12 points and six rebounds, and Solomon Washington had eight rebounds. Taylor fouled out with 2:03 remaining in the game, but the Aggies were comfortably ahead 74-58 at the time. John Mobley Jr. totaled 13 points and Micah Parrish had 10 for Ohio State.

They were 6-for-22 on 3-point attempts, though they committed only seven turnovers. The Blue Demons, who have played only home games, have reached the 80-point mark in every outing. This was their third victory with more than a 25-point margin. DePaul led 37-31 at halftime after trailing 16-9 less than eight minutes into the game. Following the early burst, Duquesne had a stretch in which it scored only two points in more than five minutes. The Blue Demons outscored the Dukes 25-13 across barely more than nine points to begin the second half, with that stretch capped by a Rivera 3-pointer for an 18-point lead. During that span, the Duke went 2 1/2 minutes without scoring, and they couldn't recover. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Phoenix shot a season-low 29.3 percent from the floor, its worst percentage in a game since March 2006. The win in their NBA Cup opener was the third straight victory for the Thunder. The Suns have dropped three of their last four and have dropped both of their tournament games so far. Phoenix got off to a dreadful offensive start as the Thunder led by as many as 17 in the first quarter.

McDavid reached 1,001 career points when he had a goal and an assist as the Oilers defeated the visiting Nashville Predators 3-2 in overtime on Thursday night. The Oilers captain became the 99th player and the fourth fastest to reach 1,000 points with a second-period goal. He also assisted on Darnell Nurse's overtime winner. McDavid (341 goals, 660 assists) has played 659 games, and at 27 is the fourth-youngest player to hit 1,000 points. Edmonton has won three in a row and five of seven as it starts a three-game Eastern swing.  The Maple Leafs defeated the host Washington Capitals 4-3 in overtime on Wednesday. Toronto will be without Auston Matthews (upper-body injury) for the sixth straight game on Saturday. McDavid was glad to reach his milestone at home. ""Just seeing the way the players reacted means the world to me. It means everything to me,"" McDavid said. ""To hear the fans, that stuff means more to me than any of the numbers. It was a really special moment. ""These milestones are a great time to reflect and look back. It's been a good 10 years and hopefully 10 more good ones. Some of these things have kind of hit me a little more emotionally than I would have thought."" The previous player to reach 1,000 points was Toronto's John Tavares on Dec. 11, 2023, in his 1,109th game. Tavares scored Toronto's overtime winner on Wednesday. Leon Draisaitl, who assisted on McDavid's goal and has factored into 445 of his points, said he would not be surprised if his teammate reached 2,000 points. ""If not him, who else? That is the only question I have,"" Draisaitl said. ""I never bet against Connor McDavid. I have learned that over the last 10 years. It wouldn't surprise me."" The Maple Leafs have won four of their past five games, all without Matthews, who led the league with 69 goals last season. ""No setbacks,"" Toronto coach Craig Berube said on Friday. ""We're doing what we can. We have two games in a long stretch here, so we're just letting him recover."" Toronto does not play again until Wednesday against the visiting Vegas Golden Knights. Max Domi (maintenance) did not take part in practice. Toronto scored twice in the final 4:09 of regulation to force overtime at Washington. It was Toronto's first road win when trailing by more than one goal with fewer than five minutes remaining since Dec. 6, 2010 -- also against the Capitals. ""They just kept working,"" Berube said. ""I mean, we got behind, I get that, but I thought in the second period from the 10-minute mark on, we started to really press and do some real good things in the offensive zone and get some opportunities, and it carried over in the third."" ""We talked about staying with it,"" Tavares said. ""Their lead increased and a couple didn't count, but we found a way. Good character win and bounce-back."" Toronto had two goals called back and Washington had one disallowed. Toronto defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson played in his 1,000th NHL game on Wednesday. Another Toronto defenseman, Jani Hakanpaa (lower-body injury) made his season debut after missing the first 17 games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Settle's tough layup through two defenders flipped the scoreboard the Owls' way, while Zion Stanford's coast-to-coast finish closed the run.

""It is quite a short golf course, so you have a lot of wedges coming in,"" Hull said about the 6,349-yard Pelican Golf Club course. ""You have to be quite accurate with your shots, and the greens are super-fast. It's a good, fun course to play.""

Those rebounds gave the Gators an edge in second chance points, 16-9. Florida needed all of the rebounds too, after having a difficult evening holding onto possession, giving the ball away 19 times (compared to eight turnovers for FSU).

Zverev, who hails from Germany, dispatched Carlos Alcaraz of Spain 7-6 (5) and 6-4. It was a matchup of the No. 2 and No. 3 players in the ATP rankings, with Zverev's win securing him the No. 2 ranking for the year. The players are also very familiar with one another, with Zverev holding a 6-5 advantage in head-to-head matches. ""I'm thrilled to have gotten this win considering how many times he's beaten me in crucial matches this year,"" Zverev said. ""We have developed a strong rivalry along with a great friendship, so it's always a pleasure to face him on the court."" In a match that went 1:59, Zverev led in aces 9-6 and had fewer unforced errors (25) than Alcaraz (34). Alcaraz held serve to force a tiebreak in the first set, then went up 2-1 in the tiebreak. Zverev took the next four points, however, and won 7-5. From there, he won the first two games of the second set and kept Alcaraz behind him. In the other match of the day, Norway's Ruud took care of Andrey Rublev of Russia 6-4, 5-7, 6-2. Ruud, No. 7 in the ATP rankings, kept the eighth-ranked Rublev at arm's length in a match that lasted 1:45, scoring 15 aces while converting 3-of-4 break points. Rublev recovered to score 19 winners in the second set while making just seven unforced errors, setting up a decisive third set. Ruud was never threatened after Rublev cut his lead to 3-2, giving up no points after that. Zverev advances to face American Taylor Fritz, while Ruud will face world No. 1 Jannik Sinner of Italy. ""Knowing that tomorrow I'm playing the world No. 1, I need to be 100 percent ready,"" Ruud said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""We're honoring his wishes, and we'll keep all those reasons and conversations private for obvious reasons and wish him the best."" Macdonald said Williams' decision-making process was unrelated to the season-ending ACL injury he sustained as a member of the Miami Dolphins in 2023. ""It's been a process throughout the week,"" Macdonald said. Macdonald said that second-year pro Olu Oluwatimi will start at center against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday. ""He's a guy that's been knocking on the door for a while,"" Macdonald said. ""Obviously it's an unforeseen circumstance that you've kind of got to take on head-on, but the silver lining in the whole thing is we get to see Olu go do his thing.

Overall, he started 86 of 92 games played over seven seasons with the Dallas Cowboys (2018-21), Dolphins (2022-23) and Seahawks.

""Of course we're fired up to see DK out there. He's practicing great. Excited to see him go do his thing."" Right tackle Abraham Lucas (knee) will be available to play for the first time this season. He underwent surgery in January.

Collins was a limited practice on Thursday before being a full participant on Friday. ""Just happy to be feeling good and happy to be able to have the opportunity to play this week and just continue to pick back up where I left off,"" Collins told reporters Friday. Collins was off to a stellar start with three 100-yard outings over the first four games before being injured in Week 5 during a victory over the Buffalo Bills. Collins, 25, was the NFL's leading receiver at the time of the injury. He recorded 32 catches for 567 yards and three touchdowns in five games. Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud has struggled in recent weeks so it's no surprise he is happy that Collins will be on the field. ""It is huge. I am very excited to have my guy back,"" Stroud said. ""I am just happy for him to be back with the team, be a part of the locker room again. They are in solitude, when players are injured, they are on their own.

Virginia made more 3-pointers (14) than 2-pointers (11) and shot 56 percent from distance. Jacob Cofie (12 points) had two treys. Eric Dixon paired 20 points with eight rebounds and Jordan Longino finished with 10 points and three steals for the Wildcats (2-3), who shot just 9-of-32 (28.1 percent) from 3-point range and were outshot 51 percent to 35.2 percent overall.

McKneely later iced the game on his four-point play, which extended the Cavaliers' advantage to 64-48 with 2:10 left. Eight of Virginia's 11 buckets in the first half came from distance, including seven straight during a 9 1/2-minute stretch after Villanova had jumped ahead 9-2.

""Not only was Al a memorable player for the Dodgers in the 1960s, but he tirelessly supported the Dodgers community efforts and was one of our most committed alumni supporters. We extend our sympathies to his family."" Ferrara was named the Dodgers' MVP in 1967 when he batted .277 with 16 homers and 50 RBIs in 122 games. Following the 1968 season, Ferrara was chosen in the expansion draft by the Padres and was the prime left fielder for the franchise during their first two seasons. He batted .260 with 14 homers and 56 RBIs in 1969, and hit .277 with 13 homers and 51 RBIs in 1970. He played 138 games both seasons. The Padres traded Ferrara to the Cincinnati Reds in May 1971.

That result may not have seemed particularly likely through the first half of Round 2 after some members of the field completed the first round earlier in the day after a suspension due to darkness Thursday. Lower still began his second round tied for the lead with Hayden Springer and had three birdies over the first five holes before a bogey at No. 9. ""I had a bad break on 6 and 9,"" Lower said. ""To not get the par 5s when they're all kind of reachable other than No. 2 just being into the wind, that part kind of sucks."" But things heated up for Lower at Port Royal Golf Course when he carded birdies on Holes 10, 12, 13 and 14 to stake himself to an eventual two shot-lead over Robby Shelton and Ryan Moore. Most of the field completed the second round before play was suspended due to darkness for a second straight day. Lower still felt he could have finished a little stronger. ""Yeah, it felt good most of the day, pretty solid for the most part,"" Lower said. ""It would have been nice to get one of those last two putts to go in on 17, 18, but still a great round and I'm happy where I'm at."" On Thursday, Springer and Lower shot 6-under-par 65s to grab an early one-shot edge over Patrick Rodgers, Joseph Bramlett and Kevin Dougherty before play was suspended. Springer shot a 1-under 70 to fall off of Lower's pace and fall into a tie for 10th. Rodgers (71), Bramlett (72) and Dougherty (73) also fell behind the leaders. Shelton and Moore, meanwhile, matched Lower on Friday to stay in contention. An eagle on 17 highlighted Shelton's day, and he added five birdies to finish 7-under 64. Moore was a little more up-and-down, with bogeys at 16 and 8 to go along with his eight birdies. ""If you start missing it 20 yards offline here, you can get it in trouble really quick,"" Moore said. ""For me, it's controlling that ball and keeping the misses at least in reasonable places to be able to play. The greens are receptive enough that it's not ideal being in the rough, but you still have a chance to knock it on the green and have a reasonable putt, but it's always better being in the fairway."" Shelton spoke about not looking ahead to the FedExCup rankings and to focus on the moment. ""You know you have to play well and you know that you need to win,"" Shelton said. ""A top-5 would be great, but you're really looking for the win. You're not looking at the cut line, you're going out to win. That should be your mentality every week."" Among those who did not finish the second round, Greyson Sigg is in the top position at 4 under through 16 to tie for sixth place. Sam Ryder (62) and Kevin Kisner (66) are tied for fourth at 9 under through two complete rounds. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Forward Jordan Eberle, the Kraken's captain, will miss at least Saturday's game against the Islanders and Sunday's contest with the Rangers because of a lower-body injury that happened early in the second period of Thursday's 3-1 victory against the visiting Chicago Blackhawks. Kraken coach Dan Bylsma said after practice Friday that Eberle will need additional tests and will be re-evaluated early next week. The addition could come in the form of forward Daniel Sprong, who was re-acquired in a trade with Vancouver a week ago. Sprong, who scored 21 regular-season goals for the Kraken when they reached Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals in 2022-23, finally got his immigration paperwork approved and was expected to arrive in Seattle on Friday afternoon.  However, Sprong hasn't played since Nov. 7 so the Kraken might instead look to their American Hockey League affiliate in Coachella Valley, which is playing this weekend in nearby Abbotsford, B.C. Eberle was injured 13 seconds into the second period Thursday when he slid awkwardly into the end boards after a collision with Blackhawks defenseman Connor Murphy. Eberle made it to the bench on his own bunch hunched over in pain immediately afterward and trainers helped him down the runway toward the locker room. ""We were moving pretty well before (Eberle) got hurt. I think there was a little bit of a step back, obviously, after your captain goes down in a not great way,"" said Kraken forward Matty Beniers, who scored the opening goal later in the period. ""So I think it was a great response and needed at that time."" The Kraken's Jaden Schwartz, a 14-year veteran, added his 200th career NHL goal in the third period as Seattle improved to 3-0-0 on its six-game homestand. ""It's a cool milestone,"" Schwartz said. ""It's not something you really think about on a day-to-day basis. But certainly, it's fun to chip in and help the team. It's always nice seeing guys play certain games that are milestones or have hit different (benchmarks) ... And, yeah, guess as I'm getting old, it's something you realize a little bit. ""It wasn't the cleanest game execution. Maybe it wasn't perfect, but it's an 82-game schedule. The standings are tight, and you've got to find ways to win, especially at home."" The Islanders won 5-2 on Thursday in Vancouver as Jean-Gabriel Pageau, Scott Mayfield, Pierre Engvall, Anders Lee and Noah Dobson scored. ""It was a huge team effort,"" Islanders coach Patrick Roy said. ""It's hard for me to single out anybody because everybody played real solid."" Goaltender Semyon Varlamov stopped 25 shots as the Islanders extended their point streak to five games (3-0-2). ""To finally get rewarded for playing the right way, it definitely feels nice,"" said Islanders forward Bo Horvat, who had a pair of assists in his return to Vancouver.

ESPN reported Friday that a four-team format is being considered for a mini tournament that would be conducted throughout the weekend. Instead of the traditional East vs. West format, NBA All-Stars would be divided into three teams. Those teams would wait for the winner of the Rising Stars Game to fill out the four-team field, with a semifinal and final round. The report indicated that the NBA has considered the plan for at least six months. The competitive nature of the game has been in question for some time, with the All-Star Game itself getting a rules tweak in recent years. From 2020-23, the game was played to a target score in the fourth quarter, but that format was abandoned last season. Last year's All-Star Game at Indianapolis was of particular concern after the Eastern Conference earned a 211-186 victory over the Western Conference. It was the first time in All-Star Game history the winning team amassed 200 points, while the 397 total points was a game record. Also under consideration is the expansion of the 3-point shooting contest that occurred between Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors and Sabrina Ionescu of the WNBA's New York Liberty that was won by Curry. Former Warriors sharpshooter and current Dallas Mavericks player Klay Thompson could be added to that format along with the Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

BYU has defeated 16 consecutive nonconference foes in a row at the Marriott Center and has won 21 straight at home in November, dating back to 2019. In addition, the Vandals (1-2 this season) are 2-3 all-time against BYU. Their last win over the Cougars was a 42-41 victory at the Helms Foundation Invitational Tournament in Los Angeles on Dec. 29, 1947.

The rare card that features Skenes’ rookie debut patch was released in a pack on Wednesday. Now, the Pittsburgh Pirates are desperately trying to find that card. The Pirates are offering the fan who finds the card two Pirates season tickets behind home plate for the next 30 years and a softball game for 30 people at PNC Park, plus coaching from former Pirates players.  The package also includes a unique spring training experience, including a private tour of Pirates City and LECOM Park. It also includes a meet and greet with Skenes, two autographed jerseys and the ability to take batting practice with the team. Skenes also has the luxury of having a very famous girlfriend, LSU gymnast and social media sensation Livvy Dunne, who raised the offer. The person who finds the card can sit with her at a Pirates game in her suite.  An egotistical offer? Perhaps. She does have a ton of fans and obsessed followers online who would jump at the opportunity to meet her. But this has turned out to be quite the offer for a very rare card.  This card will be in demand. Skenes is going to be the NL Rookie of the Year and was named to the 2024 All-MLB First Team. It won’t just be Pirates fans searching for this thing. Collectors from around the country will be ripping packs in hopes of finding it.  Michael Rubin, the founder and CEO of Fanatics, has already hinted that he might have to outbid the Pirates on their offer. He has a net worth of $10.6 billion. If he really wants that card, he’s going to get that card. If someone outside of Pittsburgh finds the card, the offer might not seem that great. Maybe they could give you the face value of those home plate season tickets for the next 30 years? That would at least start a conversation.  This is one of those crazy scenarios where it really depends on who finds the card. If it goes to some preteen in Pennsylvania, the Pirates will be able to proudly display that card in PNC Park how they want to. But if some older, greedy sportswriter happened to get their hands on it, you better believe they would be calling Rubin and selling that thing to the highest bidder for cold, hard cash. Good luck getting that card, Pirates. Copyright 2024"

As for which coach has his program in better shape, well a clue may come Saturday afternoon when the Fighting Irish (2-0) visit the Hoyas (2-0) in Washington, D.C. With wins over mid-major teams, the former Big East rivals are off to promising starts. While Notre Dame has done it largely with players who were in the rotation last year, Georgetown's cast is mostly new. The gem of the Hoyas' recruiting class, Thomas Sorber, has been even better than advertised. Averaging 22.5 points and 11.0 rebounds in his first two college games, Sorber captured the Big East freshman of the week award. ""I don't think anybody can guard him down there,"" Georgetown guard Jayden Epps said. ""He's unselfish and he'll pass it out if they double. So I always tell Coach to look down there and try to get him established to just open up the rest of the game."" Epps shares the backcourt with transfers Malik Mack (Harvard) and Micah Peavy (TCU). The trio is averaging a combined 39.5 points and 11.5 assists, with Peavy adding 5.0 steals and 4.5 rebounds per game. The early reviews also have been good for Notre Dame, especially for improved Tae Davis. He has flashed his power inside and his quickness and skills on the perimeter. In the Fighting Irish's 86-77 win over Buffalo on Monday, Davis tallied a career-high 27 points to help save his team on a night in which it made only 5 of 20 shots from 3-point range. ""Last year, we're losing this game,"" Shrewsberry said.  Davis also played a big role on defense. He helped contain Buffalo top threat Tyson Dunn to nine points, including a 0-of-8 shooting performance from 3-point range to go along with seven turnovers.   Marcus Burton also excelled for Notre Dame, providing 19 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. Shrewsberry credited his team's bond off the court for their newfound ""resolve and toughness."" ""A team that's close off the court, it translates to what you're doing on the court and it translates the most when there's a little bit of adversity,"" he said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",NFL Winners and Losers: Doug Pederson was once a coaching star. What happened?,https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl-winners-and-losers-doug-pederson-was-once-a-coaching-star-what-happened-212137132.html,"Sun, 17 Nov 2024 21:21:37 GMT",Doug Pederson's miserable season hit a new low on Sunday.,"Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan laid out an expectation for his team a few days before this season started. “Make no mistake: this is the best team assembled by the Jacksonville Jaguars ever,” Khan said. Not too long ago, that best Jaguars team assembled would have seemingly been in great hands with head coach Doug Pederson. When the 2017 Philadelphia Eagles won the only Super Bowl in franchise history, certain truths seemed apparent when it came to Pederson. He was revolutionizing the game by being more aggressive on fourth downs than any coach before him (that has held true). He was a quarterback whisperer who had Carson Wentz on an MVP track and then coached up Nick Foles to an epic Super Bowl MVP run. He was also a top five, at worst, coach in the NFL. He outcoached Bill Belichick in a Super Bowl. That happened. And he was going to be the Eagles' coach for a long time. That was Pederson's second season as head coach. On Sunday, as the Detroit Lions crushed the best team the Jaguars have ever assembled 52-6, which is the worst loss in Jaguars history, those days of Pederson being a star in the coaching industry seemed like a lifetime ago. The loss dropped the Jaguars to 2-9 and might finish Pederson's time with the Jaguars. On Saturday, someone leaked to NFL Media that with the Jaguars' bye week coming up, big changes could be made including firing Pederson. That's an underhanded way of finding out that keeping your job might depend on winning at Detroit, but at least Pederson knew the stakes. And like just about everything else since that Super Bowl win with the Eagles, Pederson fell short. The Lions were up 28-3 late in the second quarter. Jared Goff finished with 412 yards for four touchdowns and a perfect 158.3 passer rating. There have been plenty of embarrassing days for the Jaguars this season, but Sunday was a new low. If the season ended today, the Jaguars would have the first pick of the 2025 NFL Draft. They also look like a team that should be drafting first overall. The question is, what happened to Pederson? The easiest way to explain it is he caught a hot streak with a really good Eagles roster and a coaching staff around him that had a heck of a season. Philadelphia went 13-3 that season. Pederson is 42-50-1 since with two playoff wins in six seasons since. The longer answer might have to do with the relationship with his players, particularly quarterbacks, since that magical 2017 season. Pederson's frayed relationship with Wentz was a key reason the Eagles relationship ended so soon after the Super Bowl. Pederson's relationship with Trevor Lawrence will be dissected, but at very least it's clear that Pederson didn't get the best out of a quarterback making $55 million per season. Pederson seemed to blame the players at times this season, while going out of his way to protect embattled offensive coordinator Press Taylor. That blind loyalty to his staff was another reason he was ousted in Philly and a reason he failed in Jacksonville. The team's schemes on both sides of the ball seemed stale. Lawrence was injured and didn't play on Sunday, and Mac Jones hasn't covered himself in glory in either start replacing him, but it's not like there was much creativity to help him. And the Jaguars defense is still giving up points to Detroit. In February of 2018, it seemed impossible to think that a little more than six years later Pederson could be out of chances as an NFL head coach. He looked like a Sean McVay or John Harbaugh, a championship coach that would be a fixture in the NFL for a long, long time. Then, as quickly as he seemed to figure out the NFL in Philadelphia, the game suddenly passed him by. Here are the rest of the winners and losers from Week 11 of the NFL season: Anthony Richardson: However the Indianapolis Colts got to the point they did Sunday with Richardson, they had to be thrilled at the results. Two games after an awkward benching, the Colts turned back to Richardson following Joe Flacco's struggles. And Richardson played his best game of the season and perhaps his best game as a pro, completing 20-of-30 passes for 272 yards and a touchdown, two rushing touchdowns and leading a go-ahead drive late to beat the New York Jets 28-27. With :46 seconds to go, the @Colts pull ahead at MetLife! 📺: #INDvsNYJ on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/8ylYdKupo4 — NFL (@NFL) November 17, 2024 Richardson's benching was criticized and looked bad when Flacco played so poorly. But if that helped Richardson refocus and play like he did Sunday, it will be worth it. Sam Darnold: It's pretty simple for Sam Darnold. If he doesn't turn the ball over, he can be an effective quarterback. Good Darnold showed up Sunday. After turning it over six times the past two weeks, Darnold was back on track against the Tennessee Titans. Darnold played an efficient, interception-free game in a 23-13 win over the Titans. Darnold did lose a fumble but it didn't cost the Vikings in what would have been a bad loss for them against a terrible Titans team. It will be hard for the Vikings to catch the Lions in the NFC North, but they still look like a wild-card team. They'll need Darnold to keep playing like he did on Sunday to get to the playoffs. Matthew Stafford: Stafford hasn't had the best season. He has been inconsistent. Last week he didn't play well in a loss to the Miami Dolphins. Stafford had one of his good days on Sunday. He had four touchdown passes and the Rams kept their playoff hopes alive for at least another week with a 28-22 win over the New England Patriots. Stafford's touchdowns included two to Cooper Kupp, one of which went for 69 yards. It hasn't been an easy season for the Rams, and the loss to the Dolphins was a huge setback for their postseason chances. But if Stafford is starting another hot streak, the Rams have some hope. Darren Rizzi: Last season, Antonio Pierce got a chance to be the Las Vegas Raiders' interim coach. He won a few games, won the fans over with his energy, and got hired as the team's permanent head coach. It's every interim coach's dream scenario. Rizzi, the New Orleans Saints' interim coach, is 2-0 and has to be feeling pretty good. The Saints played well Sunday in beating the Cleveland Browns 35-14, with Taysom Hill scoring three touchdowns to lead the way. Rizzi's energy has already gotten some positive attention for his energy on the sideline during games. We'll see what the Saints decide to do after the season is over, but if Rizzi wins enough games he'll at least get some consideration. That's all an interim coach can ask. Antonio Pierce: Speaking of Pierce, his turn as the Raiders' permanent coach isn't going that well. The Raiders look overmatched just about every week, and did again in a 34-19 loss to the Miami Dolphins. They're 2-8 after the loss. Some of that is the Raiders being far below average at quarterback no matter who they're playing. But that doesn't explain everything. Las Vegas was competing hard for Pierce last season when he was the interim coach last season, after he took over for Josh McDaniels. It doesn't look like a team that is competing at that level this season. It's not like the Raiders have a long-term commitment to Pierce. It will be a situation worth watching the rest of the season. Lamar Jackson's MVP case: Jackson has been incredible this season. But quarterbacks on teams that don't win their division don't often get MVP votes. The Pittsburgh Steelers got a huge win in the AFC North race on Sunday. Their defense did a fantastic job containing Jackson and the offense produced enough field goals to win 18-16. The Ravens got a Jackson-to-Zay Flowers touchdown with 1:06 left but Jackson was stopped on a run attempt to his left on the 2-point conversion and the Steelers held on.

Baltimore still has plenty of time to rally and win the division. Jackson's hopes at winning a third MVP award might depend on it. Matt Eberflus: Sunday was the kind of win that might have given some hope for Eberflus keeping his job. Like the Denver Broncos last week, when they lost to the Kansas City Chiefs on a blocked field goal as time expired, the Bears lost when a 46-yard field goal attempt was blocked on the final play. The Bears fought hard in their first game after firing offensive coordinator Shane Waldron but lost 20-19, their 11th straight loss to the Packers. The Bears, and Eberflus, could have really used that win over their rival. One of the turning points in the game came in the fourth quarter. On fourth-and-3 at the Packers' 49 with less than five minutes left, Chicago took a delay of game and then punted. Going for it could have helped put the game away. That decision allowed the Packers to drive for the go-ahead score, with the key play being a long catch by Christian Watson that looked like it might have hit the ground as he made the catch. The Bears drove into field-goal range but didn't try to get much closer than the 46-yard attempt, letting the clock run before trying it on the final play. That was another regrettable decision.

There can be no doubt the late, great conquistador would have been impressed with the way the Northern Irishman hauled himself out of a hole of his own digging to make it a double celebration. Ballesteros was McIlroy’s father’s hero and this victory was clearly packed with resonance. But there was far more to the crying in front of those grandstands on the Earth Course. After calling himself “The Nearly Man” because of so many agonising defeats since June and the US Open – where he handed the trophy to Bryson DeChambeau with three bogeys in the last four holes – McIlroy proved he can still produce the big moment when needed. Having blown a three-shot advantage after six holes, he hit an audacious wedge from 140 yards to inches on the 16th for a birdie that allowed him to restate his dominance over Rasmus Hojgaard and from there to lengthen out to win, not only the Race to Dubai, but the tournament itself, in the manner of a true and clinical champion. Rory McIlroy wins the DP World Tour Championship! 🏆 pic.twitter.com/cPnHOTcm1K — Sky Sports Golf (@SkySportsGolf) November 17, 2024 And although McIlroy’s detractors will claim it will only count when he picks up that elusive fifth major, the world number three had piled so much pressure on himself at the DP World Tour Championship that it genuinely seemed as if he had crossed the Rubicon. That was another reason for the ducts opening fourth. “It means a lot. I’ve been through a lot this year professionally and personally,” McIlroy said. “It feels like a fitting end to 2024 – I’ve persevered this year a lot, had close calls, wasn’t able to get it done. So to be able to get over the line. I hung on and got the job done.” McIlroy’s personal life was in disarray in May when he filed for divorce, before withdrawing the court papers a month later. His embrace with three-year-old daughter Poppy and wife Erica minutes after he secured his two-shot triumph – his fourth victory of the year – was full of emotion. On McIlroy’s garlanded CV, this success will hardly stand out – this was his third Harry Vardon Trophy in a row and his third consecutive DP World Tour Championship – but there was a palpable sense of deep importance as he posed with the two pieces of silverware. And no, it was not because the two winning cheques added up to $5 million (£3.95 million). In a week that was dominated by Telegraph Sport’s revelation that for the first time in the near 100-year history of the Ryder Cup, at next year’s match in New York one of the teams is set to be paid for playing – naturally Team USA with $400,000 each – Sunday’s scenes in the desert were the latest evidence this sport has so far more going for it than rich finance. In fact, golf is so much better when the drama and intrigue is all about the action and not the rewards. And this afternoon viewing was at times excruciating as McIlroy threatened to capitulate once more. It had looked so simple after McIlroy, the joint overnight leader, had bounced back from a bogey on the first by rolling off four birdies in succession from the second to take a three-shot lead, and when he stood over a short birdie attempt on the par-five seventh, the procession was apparently in motion. Yet he yanked that four-footer and when McIlroy proceeded to bogey the ninth and then miss birdie chance after birdie chance before dropping another shot on the 13th, the alarm bells were ringing. We had seen this before from McIlroy and not only at Pinehurst on that fateful Sunday five months ago. He gave up a lead to Hojgaard at the Irish Open in September and then again the next week to Billy Horschel at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth and that is when he called himself “The Nearly Man”. Was this to be another case of second-itis? The season-long Race To Dubai was already tied up when McIlroy came to the 16th – Thriston Lawrence had required a win and for McIlroy to finish outside the top 11 and the South African finished in a tie for 30th – and the tension was solely on the tournament proper. McIlroy produced his wonder shot to go one ahead and birdied the last to make sure, with a 68 for a 15-under total. At that point Seve’s memory figured large and so he teared up. “We all know what he means to European golf and the Ryder Cup team,” McIlroy said. “On the wall in our team room in the last match we had Seve’s shirt from ’95, the last Ryder Cup he played. So for me to be mentioned in the same breath, I’m very proud. I only have Monty [Colin Montgomerie] ahead of me now with eight of these things and I’ll be back next year trying to get within one.” Hojgaard – whose twin brother, Nicolai, won this event 12 months ago – can take consolation that by finishing second in the rankings, he has earned playing privileges on the PGA Tour for 2025. The other nine recipients of cards on the game’s premier circuit include Tom McKibbin, who pipped England’s Jordan Smith with a tie for 11th. McKibbin learned to play and honed his skills on the same small layout in a Belfast suburb as McIlroy and the champion selflessly had a private word with his countryman before he began his own celebrations.

Ball used an anti-gay term during an on-court interview. The following has been released by the NBA. pic.twitter.com/eBXmqGaExw — NBA Communications (@NBAPR) November 17, 2024 Shortly after the Hornets’ 115-114 win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday night, Ball was asked about how the team was defending Giannis Antetokounmpo on the last play of the game at the Spectrum Center. Antetokounmpo, who had his first triple-double of the season in the game, had a look at a game-winning bucket from just inside the 3-point line, but his shot barely rimmed out as the final buzzer sounded. That’s when Ball slipped in the anti-gay term. Ball had a team-high 26 points, nine rebounds and six assists in the win for the Hornets, who now sit at 5-7 on the year. He shot just 1-of-7 from behind the arc. The 23-year-old is averaging a career-high 29.6 points and 6.3 assists per game this season, his fifth with the Hornets. Ball played in just 22 games last season due to an ankle injury. The Hornets will take on the Cleveland Cavaliers next on Sunday afternoon, which will mark the start of a quick two-game road trip."

But officials threw a flag on a hard, clean hit by safety Mike Brown that extended the drive and allowed the Vikings to score a touchdown. Titans head coach Brian Callahan had to be held back as he gave officials an earful for the call. The play took place midway through the second quarter as Minnesota held a 7-3 lead. Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold looked to receiver Jordan Addison in traffic in the end zone on fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line. As the ball arrived, Brown hit Addison hard in the chest, dislodging the ball to secure the would-be stop for what would have been a turnover on downs. But officials flagged Brown for unnecessary roughness on the hit. Titans head coach Brian Callahan was absolutely IRATE after this unnecessary roughness call in the endzone Callahan was then flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct pic.twitter.com/T4efCW2W1X — Jomboy Media (@JomboyMedia) November 17, 2024 Brown did not make contact with Addison's head on the play, nor did he use his own helmet as a spear. He hit Addison cleanly in the chest with his right shoulder on a textbook hit that dislodged the ball. Instead of a turnover on downs, the Vikings got a fresh set of downs and scored a touchdown on a sneak by Darnold on the next play to extend their lead to 13-3. CBS' Adam Archuleta, a former NFL safety, was incensed by the call. ""That should not be a personal foul,"" Archuleta said. ""He hits him right in the chest. There is zero head and neck area involved in that hit."" CBS' rules analyst Gene Steratore concurred with Archuleta that officials got the call wrong. ""You’d like to see the official throw [the flag] and maybe replay come in and take it off of that foul after they’ve thrown it,"" Steratore said. Callahan, meanwhile, was irate. He walked onto the field to yell at officials as an assistant coach restrained him. Brian Callahan screaming at the refsThese bad calls ruining the game pic.twitter.com/t6Vx2q0ge8 — Faux Joey Brrr (@FauxJeaux) November 17, 2024 Callahan's reaction drew another flag, this one for unsportsmanlike contact. The Vikings were already at first-and-goal from the 1-yard thanks to the unnecessary roughness call, so the second penalty cost the Titans half a yard. Callahan got his money's worth with his rant, but to no avail as the Vikings were given a fresh set of downs that they converted into a touchdown."

BYU failed to score a touchdown in the second half and got stopped on fourth down with less than two minutes to go in the loss. The loss ruined BYU's undefeated season as Oregon, Indiana and Army are now the only remaining undefeated teams at the top level of college football. The Ducks stayed at No. 1 after a 16-13 win over Wisconsin on Saturday night. Oregon played with fire late in the game with a fake field-goal attempt, but the Ducks got an interception two plays later to seal the game. The rest of the top five remained the same with Ohio State at No. 2 followed by Texas, Penn State and Indiana. Notre Dame moved up a spot to No. 6 after Tennessee lost at Georgia on Saturday night. The Vols are now at No. 10 in a back half of the top 10 that will drive Ole Miss fans crazy. Alabama is at No. 7 followed by the Bulldogs at No. 8 and Ole Miss at No. 9. Yes, Georgia is ahead of Ole Miss despite the Rebels winning 28-10 over the Bulldogs in Week 11. Miami moved up a spot to No. 11 and is ahead of Boise State at No. 12.

After Golden State's 123-118 win over Memphis on Friday at Chase Center, Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins invoked now-famous ""code"" comments made by Warriors coach Steve Kerr during the 2022 Western Conference semifinals. But this time, the comment was made about Warriors forward Draymond Green after his foul on Grizzlies rookie Zach Edey, which Jenkins clearly believed crossed a line. ""Overall, thought he was really good,"" Jenkins said of Edey (h/t ESPN). ""And very disappointing, there was that one play, we were about to start the break and he's been playing really hard to try to outlet, and Draymond grabs his leg and pulls him down and it doesn't get reviewed. ""So I know there's a code in this league, and I don't understand how that wasn't reviewed. Very disappointing."" Zach Edey hit the floor after his foot got caught between Draymond Green's arm.🎥 @ESPN | @cjzero pic.twitter.com/r6Uqm5xYer — The Athletic NBA (@TheAthleticNBA) November 16, 2024 While Green originally was called for a transition take foul, the NBA upgraded the incident to a Flagrant 1 foul Saturday after review. Green didn't appreciate Jenkins' comments, either, insinuating the Grizzlies coach is soft with a post on his Instagram story Saturday and commenting ""Shut up!"" on a post of what Jenkins said. Draymond didn’t like this comment from Taylor Jenkins 😅 [via @Money23Green’s IG] pic.twitter.com/XxumC3cIMN — Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) November 17, 2024 There was plenty of talk about ""code"" when the Grizzlies and Warriors faced off in the 2022 conference semifinals, with Kerr taking exception to a Flagrant 2 foul by Dillon Brooks on Gary Payton II, which broke the latter's elbow, in Game 2 of the series. ""There is a code,"" Kerr said of the play at the time. ""This code that players follow where you never put a guy's season [or] career in jeopardy by taking somebody out in midair and clubbing him across the head, ultimately fracturing Gary's elbow. ... He broke the code. Dillon Brooks broke the code."" What ensued was a back-and-forth of ""code"" accusations, including Ja Morant accusing Jordan Poole of breaking it when Poole appeared to grab at Morant's knee in Game 3. Whether or not Jenkins meant to bring up codes of games past with his comments Friday night, that word certainly holds a heavy connotation for Dub Nation and Grizzlies fans alike.

He leads the NBA in 3-pointers made with 64. However, that performance was overshadowed by De'Aaron Fox exploding for 60 points, a Kings franchise record. Sacramento needed Fox to carry the team with Malik Monk and DeMar DeRozan out with injuries. Edwards scored Minnesota's final six points in regulation to force overtime and added seven more in overtime to lead the Timberwolves to victory and a 1–1 record in the West Group A standings for the NBA Cup in-season tournament. Minnesota broke a three-game losing streak and improved to 7–6 overall. This isn't the first large fine Edwards has been issued by the NBA. Last season, he was docked $40,000 for criticizing officials, saying the Timberwolves were ""playing 8-on-5"" in a win over the Oklahoma City Thunder."

The two clubs have long been vying for AFC North supremacy, with Super Bowl victories and MVPs and memorable moments that have become part of the 21st-century NFL canon. The rivalry is perhaps headlined by stability, with Mike Tomlin and John Harbaugh being the two longest-tenured head coaches currently leading NFL teams. On the field, these two clubs are led by dynamic quarterbacks. Baltimore's Lamar Jackson is working on a potential third NFL MVP award, leading the league's No. 1 offense while heading into Week 11 ranking second in passing yards and tied for the league lead with 24 passing touchdowns versus just two interceptions.

The Owls were 9-25 in 34 games under Drayton.","Temple is looking for a new football coach. The Owls announced Sunday that Stan Drayton had been fired with two games to go in the 2024 regular season. Drayton’s firing comes after the Owls took down Florida Atlantic 18-15 in overtime on Saturday. Defensive coordinator and former Texas State coach Everett Withers will be the team's interim coach for the final two games of the season. “I would like to extend my appreciation to Coach Drayton for his commitment to Temple University, our student-athlete and the football program over the past three years,” Temple athletic director Arthur Johnson said in a statement. “Under his direction, our student-athletes have excelled in the classroom, been outstanding members of the community and Coach Drayton has represented the university with a tremendous amount of integrity and class. I wish him and his family well in their future endeavors. “With the changing landscape of college football and the playoff format, the opportunity for Temple football has never been greater. Our expectation is to compete for American Athletic Conference titles, appear in bowl games consistently and build a program that our fans, alumni and students can be proud of in the classroom and on the field. I am confident that our fans will rally around our student-athletes and support them as they always have.” Competing for AAC titles and a spot in the College Football Playoff is a long, long way off for the Owls. The win over the other Owls on Saturday brought Temple’s record to 3-7. Temple was 3-9 in each of Drayton’s first two seasons and he leaves with a career record of 9-25. Temple hasn’t made a bowl game since the 2019 season when the Owls went 8-5 under Rod Carey. That was Carey’s first season with the program after he replaced Geoff Collins. Since then, Temple hasn’t won more than three games in a single season and won four games over Carey’s final two seasons. The program is a long way off from the back-to-back 10-win seasons it posted under current Nebraska coach Matt Rhule in 2015 and 2016. Rhule’s team improved by eight wins over two seasons from 2013 to 2015 before he left for the Baylor job after the 2016 season. Overall, Temple has won just one conference championship in school history and has been to nine bowl games."

Colorado’s Travis Hunter had a fantastic day on Saturday as the No. 17 Buffaloes beat Utah at home. Hunter is now -500 to win the trophy at BetMGM. His odds are so low that you would only win $2 on a $10 bet. Hunter played nearly every snap on both offense and defense once again. He intercepted a deflected pass, made a highlight-reel catch to set up a touchdown and then added a touchdown of his own in the fourth quarter as he cut back across the field when Colorado was putting the game out of reach. TRAVIS HUNTER IS JUST A CHEAT CODE 😱@CUBuffsFootball pic.twitter.com/SUCHVonSOq — FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) November 16, 2024 After the game, Colorado coach Deion Sanders was asked if he had a message for any Heisman voters who may be undecided at this point in the season. “If they can’t see they can’t see. It is what it is, Travis is who he is” Sanders said. “It’s supposed to go to the best college football player. I think that’s been a wrap since what, Week 2? We ain’t petitioning for nobody, we ain’t doing that. We have a wonderful display of cameras here and I think we’re on national television every week. If they can’t see it, there’s a problem.” “Don’t allow their hatred of me to interfere with our kids’ success. They gotta stop that. Y’all gotta stop that … y’all gotta stop that man. Give the kids what they deserve.” Hunter finished the game with three tackles and a pass defensed to go along with his interception, five catches for 55 yards, and that five-yard TD run. After his pick in the first half, Hunter made sure to strike the Heisman pose. DEFLECTED TO TRAVIS HUNTER @CUBuffsFootball with another big defense play 🔒🦬 pic.twitter.com/zAsNDKPLYA — FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) November 16, 2024 Hunter’s odds were at even-money entering the weekend and took such a big leap thanks to his performance and a couple other factors. Oregon struggled and needed a late interception to seal a 16-13 win at Wisconsin; Miami and QB Cam Ward were off in Week 12; and Boise State played San Jose State on CBS Sports Network at the same time the Ducks played the Badgers and Tennessee visited Georgia. Dillon Gabriel was 22-of-31 passing for 218 yards and an interception for Oregon on Saturday night and his odds dropped all the way to +2200. He’s now the No. 4 favorite. Miami QB Cam Ward’s odds are +1400, leaving Ashton Jeanty as the only contender close to Hunter currently at +425. Jeanty was fantastic once again in Boise State’s win over SJSU, though we’re not sure how many voters watched that game. He had 32 carries for 159 yards and three TDs in the 42-21 win. Jeanty has now rushed 256 times for 1,893 yards and leads college football with 26 rushing touchdowns. He has scored at least one TD in every game against an FBS opponent this season."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Plaschke: Can dynamic new USC quarterback Jayden Maiava revive Lincoln Riley?,https://sports.yahoo.com/plaschke-usc-quarterback-exactly-lincoln-120032187.html,"Sun, 17 Nov 2024 12:00:32 GMT","Lincoln Riley needs to approach the final stretch of the season as if he's coaching for his USC life, and Jayden Maiava could be the player who saves him.","It is a wild arm, a wondrous arm, a winning arm. But is it powerful enough to restore a reputation? It is a stalwart presence, a swaggering presence, a saving presence. But is it powerful enough to rescue a coach? Jayden Maiava brought quarterback chills back to the Coliseum on Saturday afternoon in leading USC to a 28-20 victory over underwhelming Nebraska. But can he take the heat off Lincoln Riley? Read more: Jayden Maiava struggles and shines as USC beats Nebraska to revive bowl hopes Maiava is good. He’s three touchdown passes good. He’s one rushing touchdown good. He’s lead-the-team-on-a-fourth-quarter-clinching-drive good. But is he good enough to settle the ground under Riley’s uncertain footsteps? That was the larger question looming over the Trojans as they pulled off a bowl-saving victory on a sunny afternoon when a new quarterback and new resilience showed up for the same old coach. Is it too little, too late? The 5-5 Trojans need to beat either UCLA or Notre Dame to qualify for a bowl and some semblance of stability as they finish Riley’s third season. No, Riley is not getting fired, not even after going 7-10 in his last 17 games and failing for the third time in three years to qualify for the College Football Playoff. At this moment, it costs too much to can him, as much as $60 million by one estimate. But a third consecutive poor finish combined with the arrival of a new university president could mean that if the Trojans don’t make substantial improvements next season, removing him becomes priceless. That means one more bad season would be his last season, which means he would become a lame duck. And the Trojans do not need the most celebrated football coaching hire in their history to become a lame duck. Transfers don’t flock to lame ducks. Donors don’t pony up for lame ducks. Fans turn their backs on lame ducks. Even though he’s not getting fired, Riley needs to coach these last two regular-season games and possibly a bowl game like he’s coaching for his USC life. And so, 11 days ago, he shed Miller Moss and buckled into a personal flotation device named Jayden Maiava. Riley knows what he is doing. All of USC knows what he is doing. Riley needs this to work. The entire Trojans family needs this to work. The atmosphere at the Coliseum on Saturday was lukewarm at best, a hollow homecoming, loads of great Nebraska fans often making more noise than their Trojans seatmates. For a pleasant afternoon game in the heart of November, this was not a Pete Carroll crowd, it was a Clay Helton crowd, and that just won’t do. It feels like some in the Trojans family already have given up on Riley, and those who are undecided are waiting to see how this season ends. Yeah, it’s pretty apparent, Riley’s future is now inexorably tied to Maiava. And, wouldn’t you know it, less than six minutes into the game, the kid threw a pick-six, former Trojan Ceyair Wright taking a wild throw 45 yards in the other direction and knocking the Trojans flat. Read more: Jayden Maiava becomes the first Polynesian starting quarterback at USC “Sometimes deals like that, especially at home, can take the air out of your sails a little bit,” Riley said. But no, not on this day, not with this quarterback. “The team didn’t even flinch,” Riley said, and neither did Maiava, who followed his slow start with a stretch of nine consecutive completions for 100 yards and two touchdowns en route to a 25-for-35 afternoon for 259 yards and lots of gasps. The kid takes chances. He throws up what looks like a jump ball until you realize the pass actually is directed to a leaping receiver. One such no-no-yes pass was a 28-yard hurl to Duce Robinson to set up the Trojans’ first touchdown. Said Maiava: “I saw Duce when I got flushed out the pocket. I tried to give him a ball that was his ball or nobody’s ball.” Said Robinson: “I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again — he’s a playmaker. When you have an arm like that, of course you’re gonna have confidence in it.” Maiava throws over trouble, around trouble, and sometimes directly through trouble. Two of his biggest completions — a 12-yard touchdown pass to Kyron Hudson and a nine-yard pass to Makai Lemon on their clinching drive — were balls that bounced off Nebraska helmets. And Maiava just kept flinging. “That’s just who he is,” linebacker Easton Mascarenas-Arnold said. “He’s going to take risks. Some go his way, some don’t. That’s just kind of why I think he’s a great player. He’s willing to take those risks over and over again, regardless of the play before.” Maiava certainly has that aura. He strode into the postgame press conference room with an easy smile while offering the sort of what’s-up greeting that one doesn’t normally get from nervous young quarterbacks. “I’ve got a great team, a great coaching staff, there’s nothing for me to worry about, but just to go out there and play ball with them,” he said. He not only passes with abandon, he runs the same way. His rambling style caused an unforced lost fumble that led to a Nebraska field goal, but he also deftly handled a fourth-down pitch to Woody Marks that went for 34 yards and led to Maiava’s two-yard, clinching touchdown run. “Coach Riley was in his bag,” Maiava said. “Regardless, I think we were gonna get the first.” Riley indeed called a great play there, and Trojans fans hope his sideline work will be just as inspired now that he has a new leader. “He did a good job staying in the moment,” Riley said of Maiava. “He gave guys opportunities to make plays … It showed some poise ... I thought he handled it well.” Read more: John Robinson, coach who led USC to national title and Rams to two championship games, dies at 89 Riley seems well aware of the importance of these final games. He surely knows much of his program’s future will be determined right now. “We talked to them a lot about this three-game stretch here at the end and what an opportunity it is for us,” he said. “And we got it started off on the right foot today.” Back in August, this space presented the query that was foremost in the mind of the increasingly uneasy Trojans family. “Can Lincoln Riley coach?” I wrote. “That is the question that will hover over the program from the Sept. 1 Louisiana State opener through the completion of USC’s first Big Ten season.” For some, the question has been answered, and it is a resounding no. But for others, the question is still there, still hovering, endlessly, ominously, perhaps reliant on these last two or three games. So, Jayden Maiava, welcome to Lincoln Riley’s brave new USC football world. Now save it.

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Emma Raducanu and Katie Boulter thrash Canada as GB qualify for Billie Jean King Cup semi-finals,https://sports.yahoo.com/emma-raducanu-katie-boulter-thrash-204124535.html,"Sun, 17 Nov 2024 21:18:27 GMT","Emma Raducanu displayed a combination of ruthlessness, grit and determination in a “very difficult” contest as Great Britain ousted reigning champions Canada to reach the semi-finals of the Billie Jean King Cup.","Emma Raducanu displayed a combination of ruthlessness, grit and determination in a “very difficult” contest as Great Britain ousted reigning champions Canada to reach the semi-finals of the Billie Jean King Cup. A blistering start against Canada’s Rebecca Marino saw Raducanu claim the opening set 6-0 without looking troubled, while she was forced to battle in the second before winning it 7-5. The tie itself brought Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez on opposing sides three years on from their memorable contest in the 2021 US Open final, although the rules of the team event dictated there would not be a rematch between the pair. Instead, Fernandez, as Canada’s highest-ranked singles player was pitted against British number one Katie Boulter. Britain went into the second game with a 1-0 lead following Raducanu’s victory, and Boulter secured their place in the semi-finals with a dominant straight-sets 6-2, 6-4 win over the former world number 13. Raducanu enjoyed a blistering start, but had to weather the storm at times in the second set, as she regained her focus at a key moment, to allow her to defend, and then capitalise. At 4-3 down in the second, Raducanu utilised her serve to save four break points in a single game that lasted almost 13 minutes, before breaking at a crucial moment to win Great Britain’s opening match. “It was an incredibly difficult match because the dynamics were so different in each of the sets,” Raducanu explained. Marino, ranked just outside the top 100, was offered no opportunity to gain a foothold in the opening games as Raducanu stormed to take the first set 6-0, while the Canadian struggled to get going. Although, taking such a decisive lead almost proved counter-productive. “I think it’s always difficult actually when you win a set so comfortably by the scoreline, because you almost think in your head, ‘something might go wrong here, there is no way I’m going to cruise through the entire match.’ So I was expecting it.” What Raducanu then experienced was a fast-serving onslaught followed by a powerful forehand that put the 22-year-old Briton firmly on the back foot. Relying on her serve, which has undergone work and was impressive in the opening win against Germany’s Jule Niemeier, and again against Marino, Raducanu saved seven break points in the second set across two games, and then went on the attack. “I’m really pleased with how I managed to step up on those big points, big moments,” Raducanu said. “I think I just need to keep reminding myself those clutch situations is where I really kind of thrive and I really enjoy them for the most part.” She added: “I think it [her serve] helped me out a lot in some big moments. “I hit a few double faults, but I think I take them with a grain of salt when I can serve my way out of trouble as well.” Having arrived in Malaga without a run of matches behind her after more than five weeks on the sidelines with a foot injury sustained in Seoul, Raducanu has thrived in the team environment. Sat on a bench alongside non-playing captain Anne Keothavong and in front of her fellow teammates and support staff in the temporary arena at the Palacio de Deportes, Raducanu seemed at ease in the environment. Team tournaments are limited in tennis, with only the Billie Jean King Cup and the Olympics offering a similar camaraderie that is the foundation of other sports. “I’m happy to be a part of the team and really happy to put some good level out in my singles matches. “I haven’t played for two months, so for me, it’s a really good introduction to match play.” In the second match, Fernandez looked a very different player to the last time she was on the same court as Raducanu, three years prior. Her serve had been smooth three years ago, but faltered at key moments as she appeared to be either reaching too far forward or backwards, serving up nine double faults. Boulter struggled to close out, double faulting on her first match point, but secured her team’s place in the next round with her fourth. “I feel like my level out there today was a series of what’s been building for quite some time,” Boulter said. “I’m very pleased with the way I played. I just went out with nothing to lose. Very happy with the win.” The British number one has enjoyed an impressive season, breaking into the world top 25 for the first time, and looked just as comfortable against Fernandez, as she had in the opening tie when she blew away Laura Siegemund. Great Britain will take on Slovakia in the semi-finals on Tuesday at 11am GMT. Team GB captain Anne Keothavong says she has high hopes for this Great Britain team, who face Slovakia in the last four after they beat Australia. “We were highly motivated for this and credit to all the other team members, we wanted to give as much energy to her as possible – we knew how important it was,” she says. “But Katie went out there and she was absolutely crunching the ball, and it was fantastic to see, apart from the fact that it’s a great position to go in, when Emma sets the bar high gets the win under her belt and Katie goes out there and takes a swing at it. When she strikes that ball it’s devastating. “I couldn’t be more proud of the girls. I really believe that we’ve got a team that can win this competition. We’re not there yet, there’s still some work to do, but we can enjoy this moment, Slovakia will prove to be another tough challenge for us, but anything’s possible.” Katie Boulter is in high spirits after her win, joking at first that “I was doubting myself all the way through!” She says: “I’m really happy with my level today. Emma makes it very easy to come out here and have a swing at 1-0 up so full credit to her for staring us off well. “Really proud of my performance today, I just wanted to come out here and really go at the defending champions and hopefully get a big win and, yeah, really pleased with myself. “Last night in the team room Emma told me to slow it down a bit so she could get out here and watch, so I slowed it down for her – I feel like I’m being a team player right now. “I feel like I’ve been here quite a while now, in, I don’t know, Euro-Africa zone –- but we were playing a lot of matches just to get through, I feel like we’ve been building for some time now, and I feel like it’s finally coming together, we’ve got a great team, with all the girls here, we’ve got a great chemistry going on. So proud of everyone here.” Boulter plays a measured first point, keeping the ball in play and seizing the moment to strike with Fernandez out of position. But then she sprays a terrible forehand into the net with a clearly nervous shot. A much-needed ace and she’s two points away from victory. What happened there? Looked like the point was won for Boulter as she tried to wrong-foot Fernandez but Fernandez hadn’t moved and sent a hopeful shot back towards the baseline - and it dropped in. A rocket serve is netted by Fernandez and it’s match point – but Boulter double-faults again. Can she respond to the jitters?Yes, that’s an ace for match point No 3, but the demons are beginning to toy with her mind now as Boulter finds the net with the simplest of forehands. Boom! Fernandez can’t return that serve either and it’s match point No 4. This time Fernandez nets her return and Boulter has done it, after making very heavy weather of that last set. Great Britain win match 2-0 Boulter pounds a service return at Fernandez’s feet and she can only block a forehand long. Boulter earns love-30 with a sweeping forehand, but Fernandez comes out swinging herself and twice hits the line in the same point with a whipped backhand and a drive volley. She’s probably earned that luck. Inevitably, though, at 30-all she gifts another double-fault to bring up match point. But Boulter can’t take it, sending a regulation forehand long. At deuce Fernandez produces a rare thing – an ace! And a disappointing return from Boulter hands Fernandes the game. Could this be a comeback? Boulter is serving for the match and a place in the semi-finals for Great Britain. Fernandez returns well but hits the top of the net with a double-handed backhand to give Boulter the first point – and yet more confidence. The Canadian returns well but Boulter uncharacteristically nets with her forehand. A blistering crosscourt backhand makes it 30-15 but as Fernandez just looks to stay in the point Boulter nets again. Is she getting nervous? I think so. Fernandez stays in the point and then Boulter blazes wide with her backhand and it’s a long-awaited break for the Canadian. Canada break serve. Boulter is experimenting with some new shots now. On that occasion she moved her feet at the last second to deliver a whippy forehand from inside to out. Totally bamboozled Fernandez even though she was standing on that side. Fernandez is serving better in this game, having decided to throw caution to the wind and she takes the game with two wonderful forehands that Boulter can’t get near. Boulter goes 30-love up with a big serve and an unforced error from Fernandez who nets an ambitious crosscourt forehand. The Briton responds to a fifth double-fault with two blistering aces and there’s nothing Fernandez could have done about that. Fernandez is not giving up and she forces two mistakes on the Boulter forehand to earn two game-points. Boulter saves one with a piecing angled crosscourt forehand, but has no answer to smart play from Fernandez, who has her on the run before finally forcing her opponent out of position to pick out a backhand winner, and her first game of the set. Well done Fernandez, it’s no less than you deserve. Boulter is seeing the ball the size of footballs right now. Fernandez is returning serve, but not with the requisite power, and Boulter is punishing Fernandez with her ferocious forehand. The diminutive Canadian continues to hare around the court and show plenty of resolve to stay in the rallies but at 30-all she sends a regulation forehand into the net. Boulter misses for a change with a backhand from the baseline and decelerates into her next forehand to net to hand Fernandes a break-point. You feel this a crucial point in the match. Boulter saves break-point with a brutal second serve, but a double-fault puts her up against it again. But the Briton is playing brilliantly and after a long exchange of big baseline hitting she executes a pulverising passing shot down the line. A rare overhit from Boulter and it’s break-point again, but Boulter again rises to the occasion firing a glorious crosscourt forehand into the corner for her ninth forehand winner. She battles her way to Advantage and after another long rally Fernandez can’t keep her forehand in play. Boulter is playing very well but the score is not a fair reflection of the match, which is competitive and close-fought. That’s great play from Boulter, who is returning well and then hitting her spots with her forehand. Even when Fernandez gets her serves in Boulter is there with a block return, and then a barrage of meaty groundstrokes. Great Britain bring up another break point and Fernandez looks to have the point won – only to be betrayed by another net-cord when her pass down the line looked a gimme. Luck really is not on Canada’s side right now. Great Britain break serve. That must have been soul-crushing for Fernandez, who now needs to dig deep to avoid this match getting away from her. But Boulter is turning up the power on her forehand and her serve. As if to rub in Fernandez’s deficiencies she wins the game with back-to-back aces. Fernandez keeps getting into good positions in a game but then gifting her opponent double-faults. Double-fault No 5 duly arrives at 30-15 but she battles her way back to earn game-point only to be cruelly denied by an other favourable Boulter net cord. But she doesn’t give up and earns another Advantage with a superb reverse volley at the net. Boulter booms a forehand winner but backs it up with another that’s far too long. Fernandez waves goodbye to game-point with another double-fault and then overhits a forehand to give Boulter break-point, which she hands to her on a silver platter with yet another double. I counted four in that game. Great Britain break serve Fernandez somehow returns a torpedo of a serve from Boulter but she can’t respond to another one of those forehands, which is deep and catches the Canadian on her heels. Boulter, after going long, hits a peach of a crosscourt drive on 30-all and then places another one beyond Fernandez’s reach to the cheers of ‘Let’s go, Katie, let’s go!”. Boulter is hitting with superior quality and, crucially, not serving as badly as Fernandez. That is what has cost her so far. Great Britain win first set. Fernandez is struggling with her serve. She displayed great speed across the ground and hit some aggressive forehands to go 40-15 up, but three double-faults in the game hands Boulter a 5-2 lead. She has had break points against her in every single service game and Boulter has taken three of them. Great Britain break serve. Boulter is trying to back up her serve with some big forehands but her first serve is starting to let her down and her forehands are landing a touch long. With Fernandez just trying to stay in the points and await unforced errors Boulter might need to exert more caution. But this time she sends the Canadian scampering from side to side with some solid shots of ehr own and Fernandez nets. The Canadian makes a good-looking return on 30-all but Boulter was on to it in a flash and stumped Fernandez with a whipping forehand. An unforced error and Boulter holds. Boulter returns the first serve brilliantly and then forces Fernandez wide with a well-placed backhand. It’s all Fernandez can do to slap it back and Boulter is at the net to finish a well-constructed point. At 15-30 Boulter winds up a big inside-to-outside forehand but just misses. And Boulter mishits another passing chance to give Fernandez game-point. Fernandez comes to the net but is unable to do anything other than bat Boulter’s shots back at her. Forced wide she leaves the court open for Boulter to convert. Boulter then sets up break-point with a scorching forehand Fernandez can barely get her racket to. But Fernandez, on second serve, fools Boulter with a slider that forces the Briton wide. Boulter earns another break-point though with some deep, confidently-struck groundstrokes, and Fernandez, whose serve is looking frail, especially on the second serve, goes for broke with a forehand that is just wide. The servers are struggling just now. Great Britain break serve. Boulter kicks off with a double-fault and responds well to love-30 with two big serves and a powerful forehand that Fernandez tries and fails to get back in play. But the Canadian returns brilliantly to force deuce and then Boulter appears to change her mind mid-point and sends a forehand into the tramlines. Some brilliant hitting from both players there but Fernandez’s perfectly timed forehand is too hot for Boulter to handle and she nets and loses her serve. Canada break serve At 15-all Boulter returns well and then whips a vicious forehand across court straight on to the line again. Fernandez is a tricky customer though and is looking to make Boulter move from side to side. But the Canadian booms a forehand a shade long and there’s a break-point for Boulter. Fernandez gets lucky with a favourable net cord that almost turned into a double-fault but after a nice rally in which both players fire off a wonderful array of shots Fernandez middles the net, giving Boulter a break. Great Britain break serve. After ceding the first point Boulter takes the next two with two impressive serves, the second an ace. The Briton goes too deep with her forehand to bring up 30-all and in the next point she is saved by a fortuitous net cord which leaves Fernandez with no chance. Boulter takes the game, which will be a relief, as Fernandez is a bit like a wall: whatever you throw at her seems to come back over the net. It’s a must-win match for Canada and Leylah Fernandez is wearing her game face. She loses the first point after a shonky serve but Boulter goes long with her next return and a powerful forehand is also adjudged to have travelled beyond the baseline although that was a close call. A double-fault lets Boulter back in, though, and the Briton then creams a backhand crosscourt on to the line to earn break point. Fernandez hangs in there with a real slider of a serve and moves brilliantly on the next ponit to earn game-point, which she converts with a wonderfully accurate lefty forehand, On the crowd: “We had some competition with another band but I think we snuck the win! Much appreciated to everyone supporting. Of course, it was an honour to play in front of Billie Jean King herself and Conchita [Martinez].”On playing in the Billie Jean King Cup: “My Billie Jean King Cup performances have brought very good things out of me and I think it is the same for everyone. “We all just fight extra hard, dig in a little bit. It is an honour to be representing my country carrying on and scoring a point and hopefully Boults [Katie Boulter] comes out and does the same.” Raducanu is understandably pleased to have overcome Marino after such a trying second set. “It was an incredibly difficult match because the dynamics were so different in each of the sets,” she says. “In the second set, Rebecca really upped her level and was serving great, a lot more first serves which made it more difficult to get into her service game. “I’m very pleased with how I managed to fend off my own break points and then sneak that break at 5-5 and close it out.”On getting that break: “When you’re playing a big-serving opponent like Rebecca, who is such a big server, you know there is so much emphasis on each serve. It definitely helped to have the support of our band on every single point so thank you.” Raducanu plays steady tennis to go 30-love up. Nothing too silly, just stay in the point. A booming ace arcs away from the helpless Marino and suddenly it’s match point. Another double-fault, and some smart shot selection by Marino, who gets Raducanu on the run and beats her with a crosscourt pass. Can Raducanu convert her third match point?After another long exchange, Marino goes a fraction too deep with her attempted pass. A match of two very contrasting sets. Raducanu was in utter control in the first and showed incredible resolve and durability when her opponent sprang to life. Marino served much better in the second set and barely gave Raducanu a look-in. In fact the Briton looked likelier to have her serve broken in that marathon 13-minute game. But real champions know how to guts it out when the going gets tough and Raducanu showed great heart to respond to the resurgent Canadian. Great Britain go 1-0 up. Both players are finding the lines with their shots but at 30-15 Marino hits the netcord and the ball balloons in the air offering Raducanu an easy put-away. She booms a serve to go 40-30 up but after Marino seemingly had control of another long rally Raducanu dispatches an incredible crosscourt forehand on the run into the corner when she looked beaten all ends up. Raducanu takes the next point with a brilliant return to earn a crucial break point. And another fierce return puts Marino on the back foot and Raducanu capitalises with a controlled forehand. Great Britain break serve Raducanu needs to hold serve to stay in the second set and she will be hoping it’s not another marathon service game. She gets the better of her opponent to go 30-love up, Marino not helping herself with a backhand slice that allowed Raducanu time to get back in the point. A big serve brings her to within a point of the game, and although she misses her first chance with a big forehand, she takes the game when Marino hits a meaty forehand high and long. In the first point Marino gets aggressive on her serve and comes to the net, but Raducanu passes her with a dipping forehand that clips the baseline. Raducanu takes the next point with another fine forehand to go 30-love up but Marino ratchets up her serving and powers her way to five straight points, the final one taken with a brave crosscourt forehand that somehow picks out the far corner. Raducanu has a fight on her hands now. Marino is returning better and striking the ball with confidence. She seemed unsettled in the first set and appeared to be struggling with the bright lights. A long rally on 40-30 and Raducanu’s crosscourt forehand flies wide giving Team Canada hope. Marino’s backhand is now firing and that’s glorious crosscourt shot that Raducanu can only reach with the top of her racket head. Brave serving from Raducanu saves break-point, but Marino hits three big forehands n the next point, culminating in a powerful drive volley to earn another break point. Canada waste the opportunity again, with a bad mishit, but Raducanu keeps opening the door. Marino again narrowly misses with an attempted crosscourt forehand. Raducanu hangs in there, forcing Marino on the run, and the Canadian misses this time with her forehand. Raducanu finally has a glimpse at game-point with a big serve but lets Marino back in. Neither player seem able to seize the chance when it’s offered, but as the game enters it’s 13th minute, Raducanu finally takes hers to level the set again. Marino might be ranked just outside the top 100, but Raducanu has eased into this game with a grit and determination. Going four games up without reply in the opening set has entertained the majority of the three-quarters full stadium, and she has not put a foot wrong. In the first match against Germany, Raducanu had a few fortunate points with balls that just dropped over the net, and she had another in the opening game. But that did not decide the course of the opening exchanges. When Marino was tentative on her serve, Raducanu capitalised, and followed it up with similarly impressive serves that she displayed on Friday night. Marino’s growing confidence is reflected a brilliant backhand to win the first point. She didn’t have much to aim at but she went for the shot and found the corner with a delicious helping of top spin. The rallies are getting longer with Marino hitting slower shots perhaps to upset Raducanu’s rhythm. Another fine forehand gives her the game and she edges in front in the set once again. Raducanu starts off with two booming serves to go 30-love up but then an unforced error and a double-fault brings her opponent back into the equation. Marino tries to punish a slow second serve but totally mishits it and Raducanu serves out for another hold. Marino hits a serve at 191km/hr to bring up game-point after an evenly-contested game, but after another lung-bursting rally Raducanu moves her opponent to the extent that she can’t reach her racket head around her attempted backhand. A searing forehand brings up another advantage for the Canadian and she takes the game after Raducanu nets a backhand on the run. Marino seems ot have settled now and it’s become more of a contest now. Marino has responded really well in this set. It would have been easy to crumble but she is hanging in there and clearly trying to cause problems with her booming forehand. Raducanu commits a rare unforced error with a simple forehand into the net, but then Marino sends a sliced backhand into the tramlines to forego a look at two break points. Raducanu double-faults, although a long, hard look at the service line suggests she doesn’t agree it was out. A long rally ensues, which Raducanu wins, showing great athleticism before forcing another error, but then she errs herself, hitting long. She saves another break-point as Marino hits a regulation forehand into the net but Marino gets a third break-point after outlasting Raducanu with some solid groundstrokes of her own. It’s deuce again as Raducanu’s serve saves her once more and Marino nets her next return after the Briton cleverly changes serve direction and speed. Raducanu clings on to hold serve as Marino’s blistering return goes a fraction long. That must have been a hard one ot take for the Canadian, but true grit from Raducanu. Whatever you can do... Marino takes the game to love with some superb serving - three aces bring her the game. Raducanu, as though she has taken umbrage at her opponent taking a game, wins the next one to love. Three big forehands and an ace brings her level in the set. That will do wonders for Marino, who was blown away in the first set. Better serving and some confident groundstrokes has earned her a game on the board Marino hits a great return in the first point but Raducanu sends it back with interest catching Marino cold. Raducano is totally in control of her powers right now and those powers looks too much for Marino. The first ace of the match brings up game-point and she toys with Marino in the final point sending her left and right, left and right, and then wrong-footing her by sending the ball down the line in the space her opponent has just vacated. It’s as one-sided as the scoreline suggests. Marino is trying to test Raducanu’s fitness and the Briton is answering her questions. A clever drop shot looks unreachable but Raducanu gets there and executes a delicious lob over the tall Canadian. Marino forces a rare Raducanu error but then is passed by a screeching forehand down the line. Marino battles to game-point but hits her intended backhand down the line into the top of the net. She can’t afford to let such chances go by and Raducanu punishes her by taking the next two points. Raducanu hits a wonderful opening winner with controlled power, but an unforced error and a double-fault helps her opponent out. A lovely backhand crosscourt shot and then a wicked disguised forehand to catch her opponent flat-footed gives her 40-30 and in the middle of the next rally Marino moonballs a straightforward forehand into row z. It’s now 4-0. At 15-15 Raducanu plays some brilliant tennis, hanging in the rally as Marino adopted a range of wicked slice shots. Raducanu bides her time and then pinpoints that backhand again with a well-placed forehand into the corner. Team GB force break-point with another unforced error from Marino on the backhand side but Raducanu then goes for two overly ambitious winners and it’s deuce. Raducanu makes the mistake of allowing the Canadian to cream another forehand on break point No 2 but a badly missed smash brings up another break point opportunity for Kent’s finest.Both players exchange a long rally forehand to forehand from the baseline and then Raducanu picks her moment and her spot with a delightful crosscourt forehand to go win her third straight game. Raducanu holds to love with an impressive game. She starts off with three big serves and a powerful forehand into the corner. Raducanu looks like she means business. It’s a promising start for Raducanu who has started out by giving her opponent some running to do. After losing the first two points Marino battles back to 30-all with two big serves, and after Raducanu forces an error for game-point Marino passes her to earn deuce with Raducanu charging to the net. It’s quite cagey and cat-and-mouse to start with, both players hitting some gentle shots as they feel each other out. But Raducanu twice forces errors on the Marino backhand to break her opponent in the first game. GB break serve Marino is 33 years old and has recently rediscovered her joie de jouer after taking a break from the game to study English Literature at University. Her game has come together in recent months and she particularly enjoys playing on indoor hard courts, which is presumably why she was selected to play today. Raducanu is also feeling revitalised. Her injury enforced lay-off enabled her to go to China, where she spent some time with her Grandma, playing the piano and feeling ‘zen’. There was nothing chilled about her on Friday, though, when she powered her way to victory. Emma Raducanu and Rebecca Marino are at the net and it’s a poor start by Team GB, who called tails when the obvious decision to make was heads. Never mind. Marino elects to serve first and we will shortly be good to go. The teams are out, and the British band who were in attendance on Friday are setting up once again. To generate an atmosphere, the DJ has dialled the music up a notch, with applause encouraged for not just the ball boys and ball girls, but the mascot as the teams wait to be announced. Great Britain had a strong home support on Friday and look like they have a similar following at the temporary arena against Canada. Great Britain are one of only four nations to have competed in every Billie Jean King Cup season going back to the inaugural match at Queen’s Club in 1963, but they have yet to win it, despite reaching four finals. That very first match produced a 3-0 home win and Great Britain have maintained a 100 per cent record against Canada, winning in 1966 and 1984. Team GB are hoping to keep that record with the help of another boisterous crowd whom Boulter described as “awesome” on Friday. “You always get behind us. In the good moments and the bad moments you’ve been with us on this journey.” Emma Raducnau and Leylah Fernandez found themselves on opposing sides three years on from their memorable contest in the 2021 US Open final, although the Billie Jean King Cup rules dictated there would not be a rematch between the pair. Instead, Fernandez as Canada’s highest-ranked singles player in the competition will play Great Britain’s highest, Katie Boulter. Raducanu, the World No 58, opens the tie with a match against Rebecca Marino, who was preferred in the singles to similarly-ranked Marina Stakusic as the No 2. Should the two singles matches end with one win for each side, the Olivia Nicholls and Heather Watson double-act will be called into action against Fernandez and Gabriela Dabrowski. Good afternoon and welcome to live coverage of the quarter-finals of the Billie Jean King Cup, where Great Britain are set to take on Canada. Great Britain made light work of Germany in the last round on Friday with Emma Raducanu making a triumphant return from injury with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Jule Niemeier, and Katie Boulter also winning in straight sets against Laura Siegemund. Boulter had high praise for Raducanu, the recently turned 22-year-old, who was playing in her first competitive match since damaging injury ligaments in her foot two months ago. “She did incredibly well,” she said. “She hasn’t played that many matches, so to see that level out there again, just doing really well, it’s really nice to see.” Boulter, the world No 25, didn’t fare too badly herself, blowing Siegemund off the court in 1hr10min with a devastating display of powerful groundstrokes for the loss of only three games. That dominant victory precluded the need for a subsequent doubles match but Team GB are not expecting to have things so easy against Canada, who are the defending champions. Raducanu is up first and faces Rebecca Marino, who is ranked No 103 in the world, while, as the top seed of the British pair Boulter will take on world No 31 Leylah Fernandez, whom Raducanu, playing as a qualifier, defeated in the US Open final in 2021.

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Yahoo Top 10: How much did Saturday's results shake up rankings?,https://sports.yahoo.com/yahoo-top-10-how-much-did-saturdays-results-shake-up-rankings-063352478.html,"Sun, 17 Nov 2024 06:33:52 GMT","Plenty happened during a busy Saturday of college football, including BYU dropping from the unbeatens in a loss against Kansas.","The SEC’s oft-used slogan — ""It Just Means More"" — holds a particular meaning this weekend. It does just mean more — more teams with losses, all bunched up toward the top of the conference, beating one another to pieces in the first year of the expanded playoff. Can six SEC teams make the playoff field? Logic says absolutely not, but no logic applies to college sports these days. With two weeks left in the regular season, there still exists the possibility that the conference will end in a six-way tie at the top. There very much exists the probability that a tiebreaker will decide at least one participant in the SEC championship game. The final tiebreaker option is a random draw out of, perhaps, Greg Sankey’s favorite hat — a made-for-TV spectacle that we’re all rooting for but that is highly unlikely (there are five tiebreakers before getting to a draw). Either way, the SEC standings are quite a jumble, led by Texas (5-1 in the SEC) and Texas A&M (5-1), two teams that meet in College Station to end the regular season. Following them is the only team that has completed its SEC schedule, Georgia (6-2), and then Tennessee (5-2), followed by Ole Miss and Alabama, each 4-2. The real issue for Top 10 purposes (and for the CFP selection committee come Tuesday’s rankings) is how to position Georgia, Tennessee, Ole Miss and Alabama as they’ve beaten one another. Georgia beat Tennessee, but lost to Alabama and Ole Miss. Tennessee beat Alabama but lost to Georgia. Ole Miss beat Georgia and doesn’t play Tennessee or Alabama. Alabama beat Georgia but lost to Tennessee. To make matters more complicated, Texas lost to Georgia at home. The worst loss of the group belongs to Ole Miss (vs. Kentucky at home). The best win belongs to Georgia (the win in Austin). Stop. We’ve gotten off on an SEC tangent, haven’t we? Plenty more happened during a busy Saturday of college football, including BYU dropping from the unbeatens in a loss against Kansas that ended in the wee hours of Sunday morning. Deion Sanders and Colorado won a fourth straight game to move to 8-2 and take control of their path to the Big 12 title game. If they beat Kansas and Oklahoma State, the Buffaloes are Dallas bound with a chance at the playoff and the Heisman Trophy favorite. Two-way player Travis Hunter had a ball Saturday again: 5 catches, 55 yards, TD; 1 rush for 5 yards, TD; 3 tackles, a pass breakup, 1 interception. In the Group of Five, another Heisman hopeful, Ashton Jeanty, scored three touchdowns as Boise State fought off a challenge from San Jose State to stay atop the G5 pecking order for a potential CFP berth. One championship game, in the American Athletic Conference, has been settled: Army will play Tulane (site TBD as the higher seed hosts). Meanwhile, Top 10 members Oregon and SMU survived scares on Saturday and so did Clemson, which keeps its ACC title hopes alive. Pitt, Missouri and Kansas State all suffered their third loss, eliminating them from playoff contention. Other happenings included Billy Napier and Florida saddling Brian Kelly’s LSU Tigers with a fourth loss this season; Stanford storming back to beat Louisville to get their first FBS home win in two years; and USC outlasting Nebraska and new offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen (the Huskers have lost four straight and have two more chances to snap their seven-year bowl skid). But enough already! To the Top 10, we go! This week: beat Wisconsin 16-13 Next week: Bye Championship teams don’t always win in dominating fashion. At times, they’ve got to survive against middling teams on the road. That’s what happened here. The Ducks trailed 13-6 in the third quarter before mounting a pair of scoring drives to take the lead. A dice-rolling Dan Lanning attempted a fake field goal that came up short in the final two minutes, giving the Badgers an opportunity to win with a touchdown. However, DT Matayo Uiagalelei picked off a tipped pass to seal it. This week: beat Northwestern 31-7 Next week: vs. Indiana It seemed like trouble for the Buckeyes at the midway point of the second quarter as they trailed 7-0. But alas, Chip Kelly’s offense reminded everyone of its extensive weapons. Ohio State scored three touchdowns in a six-minute window to take control and set up next week’s showdown with the Hoosiers in Columbus. This week: Bye Next week: at Ohio State Coach Curt Cignetti, fresh off agreeing to a contract extension and raise with IU, brings his Hoosiers to Columbus on two weeks rest and with a chance to move closer to advancing to the Big Ten title game — a phrase we didn’t expect to be writing in mid-November! And yet, the first-year coach has Indiana in the midst of a historic season (this is the first 10-win season in program history). Still, there are plenty of doubters. The Hoosiers' strength of schedule is the worst — by far — among top-10 teams. This week: beat Tennessee 31-17 Next week: vs. UMass The Bulldogs continued their dominance over the Vols, beating them for an eighth straight year and further complicating the top of the SEC standings. Down 10-0, QB Carson Beck rallied UGA with one of the best performances of his career. He rolled up nearly 350 yards passing and two touchdowns and had 32 yards on the ground with a touchdown. This week: beat Arkansas 20-10 Next week: vs. Kentucky There are stretches — maybe too many of them — when the Texas offense looks nothing like a top-10 unit. We saw it at times against lowly Mississippi State (1.5 quarters without scoring), at Vanderbilt (zero TDs in the final 2.5 quarters) and versus Georgia (scoreless for the first half). Against Arkansas on Saturday, there was more of that. But in the end, the Longhorns' defense did enough and kicker Bert Auburn made a couple of field goals to give Steve Sarkisian’s team some early cushion. This week: beat Purdue 49-10 Next week: at Minnesota The Nittany Lions are barreling toward an 11-1 finish and hosting a playoff game at Happy Valley (sounds cool, no?). But that’s not what we want to talk about here and now. Tyler Warren continues to prove that he’s one of the best tight ends — and players — in college football. He had eight catches for 127 yards, three rushes for 63 yards and scored twice on Saturday. This week: Bye Next week: at Florida The Rebels got a rest this week after the win over top-five Georgia. The path to the playoffs seems quite clear: Win the final two games and you’re in. It might not be that easy with the cluster of two-loss teams in the SEC vying for at-large berths, but the Rebels’ win over Georgia remains one of the best of anyone in the country this season. A trip to Gainesville and a home game against Mississippi State stand in the way of, perhaps, a playoff ticket. This week: beat Virginia 35-14 Next week: vs. Army (New York) The Irish won an eighth straight game after the stunning loss to Northern Illinois — a defeat that seems to have launched them into their winning ways. Marcus Freeman’s team scored the first 35 points on Saturday, leaning on Jeremiyah Love’s 137 yards and two scores for another blowout victory. Of their eight consecutive victories, six of them have come by at least two touchdowns. This week: beat Boston College 38-28 Next week: at Virginia SMU QB Kevin Jennings continued his hot streak since assuming starting quarterback duties a few games into the season. He threw for 298 yards and three touchdowns, and SMU answered each time the Eagles closed the gap or took the lead. BC led 21-20 in the third quarter before Jennings hit Jordan Hudson for a 38-yard TD. The Mustangs’ only loss of the season? By three points to 9-1 BYU. This week: Bye Next week: vs. Wake Forest The Hurricanes re-emerge in our top 10 after the loss from BYU. Sure, the Hurricanes might finish the regular season without a top-25 win and, yes, they barely survived some mighty close calls, and of course, they did lose at Georgia Tech … but other than that, things are great! Seriously, though, QB Cam Ward is one of the best players in the country and the Canes, with two wins to end the year, will be in the ACC championship game. Dropped out: BYU (4), Tennessee (8)"

But in overtime, he didn't miss his second try at a game-winner. Tatum's 3-pointer at the buzzer gave the Boston Celtics a 126–123 win at TD Garden. The victory boosted Boston's record to 11–3.

Tatum got the ball with 12 seconds left, working at the 3-point line while matched up again with Agbaji. The play seemed to call for Jaylen Brown to get free at the top of the arc, but he was knocked down by Davion Mitchell with no foul called. That left Tatum to take the shot himself. Mitchell moved over to double-team Tatum, but retreated back toward Brown, who would have been left open. Tatum then stepped back, created some more space with a dribble and finally took a shot with 0.6 seconds on the clock. As the buzzer sounded, the ball went through the net for the game-winner. Tatum finished one assist away from a triple-double with 24 points, 11 rebounds and nine dishes. Brown led Boston with 27 points, adding six rebounds and seven assists. Joe Mazzulla on how he makes sure that Jayson Tatum doesn’t look confidence in those late-game situations: “I really just remind them the work he puts in every day. More times than not, more people miss game-winners than they make them.” pic.twitter.com/JT6evXHrsP — Noa Dalzell 🏀 (@NoaDalzell) November 17, 2024 Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla praised Tatum for shaking off the miss at the end of regulation and taking the game-winner in overtime. ""I really just remind him of the work he puts in every day,"" Mazzulla said afterward. ""More times than not, more people miss game winners than they make them. ... He has the work ethic and mental toughness to work through all those things."" The Raptors fought the Celtics to the end despite being significantly short-handed with All-Star Scottie Barnes, Immanuel Quickley, Bruce Brown and Kelly Olynyk out of the lineup. Jakob Pöeltl led all scorers with 35 points, followed by RJ Barrett, who notched a triple-double with 25 points, 10 rebounds and 15 assists. Boston was without Jrue Holiday, who was sidelined with a left knee injury. The Celtics are off until Tuesday, when they face the currently undefeated Cavaliers in an NBA Cup matchup."

The Bucks' latest loss came Saturday against the Charlotte Hornets, in which the game swung on one drive that resulted in LaMelo Ball on the ground and the refs blowing the whistle. The Bucks were leading 114-113 with 7.3 seconds left when Ball was granted two free throws, which he made. The foul was called on Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, but replay showed he had done little more than graze Ball with his hand. Ball just slipped as he started going in for a drive, or as the Hornets broadcast put it, tripped on his own Pumas: “LaMelo tripped on his own pumas” - Hornets Commentators pic.twitter.com/iwkuApkeuR — Follow HeavenlyBuckets (@heavenlybuckets) November 16, 2024 Unfortunately for the Bucks, they didn't have a challenge to negate the foul. Bucks head coach Doc Rivers had both of his challenges remaining with three minutes remaining, but successfully used one to reverse a foul call on Andre Jackson Jr. with 2:46 left, then unsuccessfully used the other to challenge a call on Taurean Prince. Antetokounmpo, who had a triple-double with 22 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists, was unsurprisingly livid with the officials. Giannis crashing out again, this isn’t good. pic.twitter.com/lIPM6alGD2 — SM Highlights (@SMHighlights1) November 16, 2024 The call was egregious enough that crew chief Curtis Blair admitted his team screwed it up after the game in an interview with a pool reporter. Had Rivers still held a challenge, he would have won it. From the NBA: QUESTION: What was the final determination in confirming the call? BLAIR: During live play we called illegal leg to leg to contact. During postgame review when we looked at the play there was no illegal contact on the play. QUESTION: So if there was a challenge, which there was not at that point because Milwaukee didn’t have one available, that call would have been overturned? BLAIR: Correct. Rivers concurred, via The Athletic: “There was clearly not a foul,” Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. “When you watch the video, the ref was blocked out by one of our players. You can’t guess at the end of the game. Both teams have played too hard.” The loss was another brutal one for the Bucks, whose record sits at 4-9 this season and 21-28 under Doc Rivers. The team was missing star point guard Damian Lillard, who remains in the concussion protocol, but was ultimately done in by an 18-5 made-free-throw disparity."

It got even better Friday.,"SOUTHAMPTON, Bermuda — Egor Eroshenko already made history as the first Russian to play on the PGA Tour. It got even better Friday when he became the first Russian to make the cut. Eroshenko shot 31 on his final nine for a 4-under 67 in the Butterfield Bermuda Championship, extending his weekend in his first time playing a tournament recognized by the Official World Golf Ranking. “I’m super excited,” said Eroshenko, who played four years at the University of Central Florida. “I’m still kind of in the fog not figuring out what’s happening, but hopefully I can go grab some lunch and realize the cut is made and hoping for a good weekend.” His 36-hole total of 3-under 139 comes a week after his girlfriend, Nataliya Guseva, was runner-up in the Lotte Championship in Hawaii on the LPGA Tour. Guseva has made history of her own as the first Russian to earn an LPGA card. She decided to skip the LPGA event in Florida this week to make good on a pledge she made with Eroshenko. “She played the Asian swing and she didn’t know if she was going to play Hoakalei,” Eroshenko said, referring to the course in Hawaii. “Then maybe a week before she decided she’s playing Hoakalei, I said, ‘Well, I signed up for the Monday qualifier, and if I make it, you’re going with me.’ She said, ‘Yeah, deal.’ And I made it. “I was fortunate enough having her this week supporting, that meant a lot as well having a familiar face walking around and cheering on the lows and highs, so that was just awesome.” Eroshenko won the qualifier, held two weeks ago in Orlando, Florida. The PGA Tour could find no record of a Russian playing in any of its tournaments. ""Golf is a very hard sport, it's a lot of ups, a lot of downs. I'm just so happy and grateful that it slowly starts to pay off over the hard work."" ️ Egor Eroshenko pic.twitter.com/iSc39CjYjr — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) November 15, 2024 The OWGR has only four Russian players listed , led by Mikhail Morozov at No. 3,736. He mainly plays the Pro Golf Tour in Germany. By making the cut, Eroshenko will move past him and lay claim to being Russia’s highest-ranked male golfer. Guseva, who played college golf at Miami, won on the Epson Tour last year in Utah and earned her LPGA card. Her runner-up finish last week in Hawaii moved her to No. 25 in the Race to CME Globe, one spot behind Rose Zhang. Eroshenko has kept busy since leaving UCF. He missed out in the early stages of Q-School for the PGA Tour, and plans to go Q-School for the Asian Tour. He has been using his girlfriend’s caddie at the Bermuda Championship. And it helps having another golfer — Guseva — in his gallery at Port Royal. “I’m crazy. I get golf, golf, golf. I get way too on top of myself and a lot of thoughts,” he said. “So yesterday she was just like a mental coach. She’s like, ‘You’re crazy. Just stop thinking about this and this.’ That’s been a huge help just taking my mind off golf and goal. So that was great.”"

Oregon had the ball in field-goal range after Wisconsin turned it over on downs just outside the two-minute warning. Facing a fourth down after Wisconsin had used two of its timeouts, the Ducks elected to send the field goal team out on the field to potentially extend the lead to 19-13. Instead, Oregon ran a fake, and punter Ross James got tripped up a yard short of the line to gain.

However, Oregon avoided disaster and a lot of second-guessing when Matayo Uiagalelei grabbed a deflected pass from Braedyn Locke and sealed the win with an interception. MATAYO UIAGALELEI PICKS IT ‼️ @oregonfootball #B1GFootball on NBC 📺 pic.twitter.com/rwqA0LJz06 — Big Ten Network (@BigTenNetwork) November 17, 2024 Lanning and the Oregon coaching staff likely felt comfortable with the risk of the fake given the way Wisconsin had been unable to move the ball. Locke was just 12-of-28 passing for 96 yards. The Badgers had 226 yards of total offense and 193 of those came on their three scoring drives. Oregon’s offense wasn’t its usual explosive self, either. Dillon Gabriel was just 22-of-31 passing for 218 yards and a red-zone interception, though he had a clutch fourth down throw to Terrance Ferguson in the second half. Jordan James rushed 25 times for 121 yards and Oregon’s only TD, but the Ducks averaged 3.4 yards a carry as a team. A game like this was to be expected in the Big Ten, however. Teams have struggled traveling across multiple time zones in the conference’s massive geographic footprint this season. And Oregon hadn’t had a close road game all season. Before Saturday night, Oregon’s closest win on the road was a pair of 21-point contests. The win also clinched a spot in the Big Ten title game for Oregon. The Ducks are off in Week 13 before a home game vs. Washington on Nov. 30. Even if Oregon loses that game, it will play either Indiana, Ohio State or Penn State on Dec. 7 for the conference title and a bye in the College Football Playoff."

After LSU kicked a field goal to cut Florida’s lead to four with 5:18 to go, the Gators made it a two-score game just three plays later when Jadan Baugh ran 55 yards for a score. CAN'T CAGE THE GATORS‼️📺 ABC pic.twitter.com/UKkOLYZKvN — Florida Gators Football (@GatorsFB) November 16, 2024 It was the second big play in the second half for a Florida offense that hardly ran any plays. Baugh’s run was just the 41st offensive play of the game for the Gators. Florida scored in three plays on its previous drive after a bizarre LSU fumble. Garrett Nussmeier lost the ball as he was being sacked and ended up with LSU offensive lineman Emery Jones Jr. As Jones rumbled up the field to try to get a first down, Jones got stripped and lost the ball. Florida took over inside LSU territory and a 36-yard pass from DJ Lagway to Elijhah Badger set up a 1-yard go-ahead TD from Ja’Kobi Jackson. .@24jjack GIVES THE GATORS THE LEAD!!📺 ABC pic.twitter.com/7jIMNXRtKi — Florida Gators Football (@GatorsFB) November 16, 2024 The win makes Florida 5-5 with a home game vs. No. 11 Ole Miss in Week 13 and a road trip to a 1-9 Florida State team in the regular season finale. Given how terrible Florida State has been, the Gators should be considerable favorites. Simply settling for a bowl game is not how a Florida football season is supposed to go. But it's also an accomplishment of sorts given the Gators' injuries this season and a schedule that's been the toughest in college football. A 7-6 season would provide a glimmer of hope for Billy Napier entering his fourth season. Florida didn't win seven games in either of Napier's first two seasons in Gainesville and Gators athletic director Scott Stricklin said earlier in the month that Napier would return in 2025. LSU’s offense disappeared in the second half as the Gators kicked just two field goals over the final 30 minutes. As Florida ran 43 plays counting the two kneel-downs to end the game, LSU ran 92 and gained just 382 yards. Nussmeier continued his midseason struggles and was just 27-of-47 for 260 yards. Florida’s defense made life rough for him, too. Nussmeier was sacked six times on Saturday. He had been sacked six times in LSU’s previous nine games. The loss drops the Tigers to 6-4 overall and assuredly outside of the College Football Playoff’s top 25 coming Tuesday. Even with winnable games remaining at home against Vanderbilt and Oklahoma, it’s shaping up to be a disappointing third season for Brian Kelly in Baton Rouge."

The foul in question occurred midway through the third quarter of Friday's 123–118 win by the Golden State Warriors over the Memphis Grizzlies. As Green was driving to the basket, he lost the ball and fell in the lane near Edey's feet. Edey picked up the ball and passed downcourt. But as the rookie attempted to run, Green clamped his left elbow on Edey's right foot, causing him to fall to the floor.

But that was changed to a Flagrant 1 after the league looked at the play on Saturday. ""It definitely wasn't a basketball play,"" Edey said, via ESPN. The rookie finished the game with 14 points and nine rebounds. Draymond Green’s (GSW) foul against Zach Edey (MEM) at 7:06 of 3rd qtr on 11/15/24 has been upgraded to a Flagrant 1 after league review. https://t.co/bX7YS8MaV4 — NBA Official (@NBAOfficial) November 16, 2024 The foul was not reviewed during the game, which Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins criticized afterward. ""Very disappointing, there was that one play, we were about to start the break and he's been playing really hard to try to outlet, and Draymond grabs his leg and pulls him down and it doesn't get reviewed,"" Jenkins said, via ESPN. ""So I know there's a code in this league,"" he added, ""and I don't understand how that wasn't reviewed. Very disappointing."" The transition take foul awarded Memphis a free throw. Had it been called a Flagrant 1 during the game, the Grizzlies would have received an extra foul shot. The team already had possession on the play. Green was eventually ejected from the game after receiving his second technical foul with 30 seconds remaining in regulation. He finished with 13 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Draymond Green was ejected from the game after getting his second technical foul. pic.twitter.com/9YyFiqDE0s — ESPN (@espn) November 16, 2024 The flagrant foul was Green's first of the season. But that wouldn't be notable if the Warriors forward didn't have a history of problematic fouls. Last season, Green was suspended indefinitely for swinging around and hitting Phoenix Suns center Jusuf Nurkić in the face. The NBA cited Green's ""repeated history of unsportsmanlike acts"" in issuing the penalty. An NBA player receives one penalty point for a Flagrant 1 foul, two for a Flagrant 2 infraction. After five penalty points, he receives a one-game suspension."

The Tigers QB ran for a 50-yard TD with 1:16 to go to give No. 20 Clemson a 24-20 win over Pitt on Saturday. Klubnik’s run came on the third play of the drive after Pitt took a 20-17 lead with 1:36 to go. Klubnik found Antonio Williams for an 18-yard gain before a seven-yard completion to Jake Briningstool. Then he made the game-winning play on what he said was a call for a QB draw with the receivers running stick routes. cade klubnik 50 yard touchdown run pic.twitter.com/1k5mUeuA7R — ◇ (@HOODH3RO) November 16, 2024 Pitt still had plenty of time and a timeout to get a touchdown, but its last drive ended with a fourth-down Nate Yarnell interception near the goal line as time expired. Yarnell started the game for Eli Holstein and played well, though he was sacked eight times by Clemson’s defense. Yarnell was 34-of-54 passing for 350 yards and a TD and an interception. Before Klubnik’s run, it looked like he had done enough for the Panthers to pull the upset. Pitt got its go-ahead field goal after stopping Clemson on a fourth-down run. The Pitt defense had dominated against Clemson’s run game … until Klubnik broke the game open. Even with the 50-yard run, Klubnik finished the game with 10 carries for 41 yards (after accounting for sack yardage taken). RB Phil Mafah had 17 yards on 17 carries. The Tigers are now 7-1 in ACC play and 8-2 overall with two non-conference games to go. However, they need a loss from No. 9 Miami or No. 14 SMU if they want to play for the ACC title or some help from Louisville and Georgia Tech. The conference is likely going to come down to the common opponent tiebreaker and Louisville has two conference losses to Georgia Tech’s three. Assuming the Cardinals stay ahead of the Yellow Jackets in the standings, Clemson would be on the wrong side of a head-to-head tiebreaker against Miami or a three-way tiebreaker against both Miami and SMU because both the Hurricanes and Mustangs beat the Cardinals and Clemson did not. To avoid that scenario and make the ACC title game, Clemson needs to end up in a two-way tie for first-place, finish in a solo second or have Georgia Tech pass Louisville in the conference standings to change the common opponent tiebreaker with Miami. Got all that? Good. There’s still a lot to play for in the ACC over the final two weeks of the season. And all Clemson can do is watch the results from everyone else."

They were wrong.,"SEATTLE -- While Jamie Oleksiak led the celebration line after his point shot gave the Seattle Kraken a 3-2 lead with 3:13 to play in regulation, the New York Islanders were quick to wave down the officials and get a review. As Oleksiak released the puck from the point, Brandon Tanev, on his own, went into the blue paint and bumped into netminder Ilya Sorokin. The shot deflected off of Nelson and less than a second later snuck under an off-balanced Sorokin and in. But after review, the call on the ice stood, and the Islanders left Seattle with a regulation loss, their first in five games: everyone thank mr oleksiak rn!!!! pic.twitter.com/LP6aE7c2tq — Seattle Kraken (@SeattleKraken) November 16, 2024 While the Islanders did have 3:13 to come back and find an equalizer, they were given a two-minute penalty for the failed challenge. Brock Nelson, who scored earlier in the third period, got on a breakaway but was stoned by Kraken netminder Joey Daccord. After the game, Patrick Roy was furious that the challenge did not lead to a call reversal. ""[The explanation] was a funny one. He said it was not enough,"" Roy said. ""He went in by himself. He bumped into our goalie while the puck was coming. And apparently, there's enough and not enough in our league."" The New York Post's Ethan Sears began to ask Roy a question starting with ""Do you think"" but the Islanders' bench boss didn't let him finish. ""That we got robbed?"" Roy said. ""Yeah."" Sears then asked Roy if he felt like he had a strong understanding of the rule and how the NHL enforces it. ""I guess tonight, I don't because there's enough and not enough,"" Roy said. ""Somebody's going to have to explain to me what's enough and not enough. You're in the crease, or you're not in the crease by yourself. You bump into the goalie, or you don't bump into the goalie. That was the first time I ever heard that. I guess I didn't play enough games. Newsday's Andrew Gross then said,"" Yeah, I was confused"" in which Roy replied with,""Totally. We all are."" I went up to Anders Lee after the game and asked what he saw on the replay.  Steven Bisig-Imagn Images ""With the calls that are going on in this league right now, it's tough to even know,"" Lee told The Hockey News. ""I saw it the other night against Toronto and Washington. So many of these are up in the air. You might as well give it a shot and it didn't go for us tonight."" Here's the play that Lee is referring to from the Toronto-Washington game, where barely any contact was called goalie interference: This was ruled goalie interference 😂pic.twitter.com/YyiUT3x5Ld — Spittin' Chiclets (@spittinchiclets) November 14, 2024 Nelson, who made it clear that he needed to block the Oleksiak  shot completely, shared his thoughts on the failed challenge. ""I feel like there's quite a few different interpretations of goal interference between the league and referees and players, so we thought he was in the crease without being pushed in by one of our guys and made contact,"" Nelson said. ""I guess they deemed it not to be enough of interference."" Here's what the league said regarding their decision: ""Video review confirmed that Brandon Tanev’s position in the crease did not impair Ilya Sorokin’s ability to play his position."" The Islanders didn't lose this game because of a failed challenge. They were up 2-1 in the third period but blew the lead after having chances to extend it.  Steven Bisig-Imagn Images Did they deserve a point, with every point critical in this Metropolitan Division and Eastern Conference wild-card race? Yes, they did, especially since they continued to play strong hockey despite still being down two-thirds of their top line and the entire left side of their defense. Unfortunately, the Islanders, instead of having points in six straight games, lose their second game in their last three (1-1-1) and head to Calgary with a sour taste in their mouth."

Barmore will be removed from the NFL's non-football illness list, according to ESPN's Mike Reiss, and will be available to play. The 25-year-old Barmore practiced on Thursday for the first time this season and Patriots head coach Jerod Mayo said there was a chance that Barmore could play. “[Thursday] was a good day,” Mayo said. “Just to see Barmore out there was a great sight to see. The expectation is there is no expectation. When he’s ready to go, he will play. ... We’ll leave the final decision up to the medical professionals.” Following Thursday's practice, Barmore posted on an Instagram story: “Where there's no pain, there is no gain."" Barmore had a breakout third season in 2023 after the Patriots selected him in the second round of the 2021 NFL Draft. The Alabama product appeared in all 17 games and had 65 tackles with 8.5 sacks and 13 tackles for loss. The extension he signed with the team included over $40 million in guaranteed money. “Very excited to have another playmaker on the field. Barmore is one-of-a-kind, very good pass-rusher. So glad to have him back in that element,” said defensive tackle Davon Godchaux. In order to activate Barmore, wide receiver Tyquan Thornton was waived. Thornton, 24, was selected by the Patriots in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft. In three seasons, Thornton had 39 receptions for 385 yards and two touchdowns with New England. He only suited up for four games this season and made four total receptions."

NASCAR has dropped a clause from its charter deal that would have prevented the teams from running as open teams next season because they brought legal action against the sanctioning body. Neither team has signed the charter agreement with the sanctioning body and have filed an antitrust lawsuit against NASCAR accusing it of monopolistic practices. “We are pleased to announce that NASCAR has removed the anticompetitive release requirement in its open agreement, which will now allow 23XI and Front Row Motorsports to race as open teams in 2025,” attorney Jeffrey Kessler said in a statement. “My clients will continue their appeal to the 4th Circuit to issue an injunction so that they can run as chartered teams therefore avoiding irreparable harm.” “Both race teams are pleased that they will continue to be a participant in this sport that they love while fighting to make it fair and just for all.” The teams’ initial request for an injunction was denied last week. The two teams are appealing the ruling as they ask to compete as chartered teams next season while the lawsuit proceeds. Chartered teams are guaranteed entries into every race on the Cup Series schedule and get a larger share of purse money than open teams do. The two teams were the only ones to not sign NASCAR’s new charter agreement. The previous agreement expired at the end of the 2024 season. The teams have called NASCAR “monopolistic bullies” and 23XI Racing co-owner Denny Hamlin had said that NASCAR’s offers to teams had not improved over the course of the season. Both teams competed as two-car entries in 2024. 23XI Racing fielded cars for Bubba Wallace and Tyler Reddick, while Front Row had cars for Michael McDowell and Todd Gilliland. While the removal of the clause means that both teams will at least be able to attempt the Daytona 500 without a guaranteed starting spot, the fates of their potential charter deals for third cars are still unknown. Stewart-Haas Racing closed down at the end of the 2024 season and had an agreement to sell a charter to each team. If both 23XI and FRM compete as open teams in 2025, it’s unclear who will own the charters if the deal doesn’t go through."

The school announced Saturday morning that it had signed its first-year coach to an eight-year contract extension. Cignetti was hired from James Madison over the offseason and the No. 5 Hoosiers are 10-0 with two games remaining in the regular season. Cignetti will receive $8 million per season in a deal that basically doubles the per-year salary of his initial deal. ""Since arriving on campus, Coach Cignetti has been the architect of one of college football's greatest turnarounds and has shown the world that IU is also a football school,"" Indiana president Pamela Whitten said in a statement. ""Coach Cignetti exemplifies IU's goal to win in all that we do. The success he has brought to Indiana football is shining a light on all that is amazing about Indiana University. We are excited that Coach Cignetti and his wonderful family will be a part of the Hoosier Nation for many years to come."" Indiana has been the biggest surprise of the 2024 college football season so far. The Hoosiers can clinch a spot in the Big Ten title game with a win at Ohio State on Nov. 23. Indiana has never played in the Big Ten championship game. And the Hoosiers had never won 10 games in a single season until 2024. Cignetti overhauled the roster through the transfer portal in the offseason. The group of new players included quarterback Kurtis Rourke from Ohio. Rourke has completed nearly 72% of his passes for over 2,400 yards so far and is averaging just over 10 yards per throw. He’s also thrown just four interceptions to 21 TD passes. The Hoosiers’ success this season also means Cignetti’s remarkable coaching streak continues. He has never coached a team with a losing record since becoming a college football head coach in 2011. Cignetti was hired by IUP 13 years ago and went 53-17 with the Crimson Hawks. He was then 14-9 in two seasons at Elon before taking over at James Madison in 2019. The Dukes were 33-5 in three seasons at the FCS level and made the semifinals in each of those seasons. James Madison moved up to the top level of college football in 2022 and promptly went 8-3, though it was ineligible for a bowl game. The Dukes were 11-1 in 2023 under Cignetti and went to the Armed Forces Bowl."

The 31-year-old scored 31 points and added 14 rebounds, while Lakers rookie Dalton Knecht scored 27 points. LeBron James managed 21 points, seven rebounds and five assists for the visitors but failed to extend his career-best streak of four consecutive triple-doubles. Brandon Boston Jr and Brandon Ingram, who had 32 points for the hosts, made consecutive three-pointers to give the Pelicans a 97-95 lead. But 39-year-old James responded with back-to-back three-pointers to give the Lakers a 101-97 lead with 37 seconds remaining. ""Big-time win. We want all the wins we can get. We don't have no time to feel out the first month or two,"" James said. ""Every game is important. To get this win in a hostile environment was big for us."" Elsewhere on Saturday, Jayson Tatum scored a three-pointer at the buzzer to guide the Boston Celtics to a 126-123 overtime win over the Toronto Raptors. Tatum narrowly missed a triple-double with 24 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists as Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 27 points.

The incident happened at Estadio Francisco Morazán in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, as Aguirre, 65, was approaching Honduras manager Reinaldo Rueda for a post-match handshake. Here’s the video. Great night for Honduras marred - once again - by bad fan behavior.We’ve gotten too used to fans chucking things. It shouldn’t take this for the culture to shift, but here’s a wake-up call.https://t.co/2eiXvBN168 — Jon Arnold (@ArnoldcommaJon) November 16, 2024 ""Nothing, nothing, it's football,"" Aguirre said of being hit with a beer can that ended up bloodying him. ""They deserved to win, they were better than us in areas, I've got nothing left but to congratulate them, and well, to try to lift my team's spirit. The other thing, there's no point in even mentioning it because well, it's football, I'm not one to complain."" Said Rueda of what happened, ""I’m sad about what happened at the end. That truly can’t ever happen again, here or in any other stadium in Honduras or any stadium in the world. “I’m sad because he’s a human being, because just like they hit [Aguirre], they could’ve hit me. That’s something that can’t happen, we send our apologies to Mexico, its people and Aguirre. The party gets damaged, all the efforts our players made on the pitch get tarnished. Something like this happening is regrettable.” Mexico's soccer federation condemned the actions in a statement released after the game. ""The FMF unequivocally condemns the acts of violence that occurred tonight at the Francisco Morazán stadium in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. Such behavior has no place in our sport. ""We demand that CONCACAF take immediate and decisive action to address this matter in accordance with its regulations. Soccer should be a celebration, not a battleground. We urge all parties, including institutions, managers, players, fans, and the media, to work together to create a safe and respectful environment for everyone involved."" CONCACAF has begun an investigation and referred the incident to the CONCACAF Disciplinary Committee for further review. After losing the first leg, Mexico needs to score at least twice in Tuesday's second leg at home to have a a chance to move on to the semifinal round in March. Nations League utilizes away goals as a tiebreaker in this stage of the competition."

Magic Johnson is third with 138. Oscar Robertson's 181 are second all-time. And Russell Westbrook tops the list with 199. The most triple-doubles James has ever notched in a season is 18 during the 2017-18 campaign. Perhaps it's surprising that he didn't record any as a rookie in 2003-04. He got two of them during the following season. James also didn't get any triple-doubles in 2011-12 and recorded one in both the 2006-07 and 2013-14 seasons."

""I've been a fan of his for a long time,"" Edwards told Timberwolves reporter Lea B. Olsen after the game. ""I mean, just watching him, I always felt like he was underrated, underappreciated by everybody. He showed us today who he is. To me, he's one of the best point guards in the league, and he showed it, man. I was guarding him; he scored on me a whole bunch of times. I got a couple stops. ""That's what you love about the game, you know -- the best two players on the floor going at each other, so that was fun."" ""I've been a fan of his a long time... that's what you love about the game, the best two players going at each other.""Ant with some major praise for De'Aaron Fox after his 60-point explosion!Edwards dropped 36 in the Wolves' OT win 😤 pic.twitter.com/gBNaCetMRZ — NBA (@NBA) November 16, 2024 Fox and Edwards certainly appear to bring out the best in each other, after the Kings star broke a franchise record for most points in a game with his 60-piece on 22-of-35 shooting from the field and 6 of 10 from 3-point land. Edwards, meanwhile, helped the Timberwolves secure their win with 36 points on 14-of-27 shooting with six 3-pointers. And one night after Edwards' praise, Fox made sure to back those words up. The 26-year-old went on two score 49 points Saturday night against the Utah Jazz, passing Boogie Cousins (104 points) for the most points over a two-game span in Kings franchise history.

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Will he or won't he? The case for Juan Soto reaching Shohei Ohtani's record $700 million contract,https://sports.yahoo.com/will-he-or-wont-he-the-case-for-juan-soto-reaching-shohei-ohtanis-record-700-million-contract-022124127.html,"Sat, 16 Nov 2024 02:21:24 GMT",Can the Yankees star match the biggest outlier contract in sports?,"At some point in the next month or two, Juan Soto is going to sign a piece of paper and become an obscenely rich man. It's unclear, however, if that new wealth will be record-breaking. Shohei Ohtani currently has the largest contract in sports history with the 10-year, $700 million contract he signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers a year ago. That deal didn't just break Mike Trout's record for baseball money, it surpassed it by nine figures. An entire Nolan Arenado contract could fit in the distance between the money in Ohtani's deal and Trout's $426 million. Soto was long earmarked to land the next mega-deal when the star outfielder hit free agency this offseason, but Ohtani's deal now looms over the negotiations. Will Soto be able to come close to the deal that made the baseball world gasp, or will Ohtani's deal remain an outlier? Here's what you should know about what Soto has going for him, and why his case is different than Ohtani's. Both players are elite hitters, and that is pretty much where the similarities end. It might be a bit of a surprise considering Soto and Ohtani both made their MLB debuts in 2018, but the 26-year-old Soto is more than three years younger than Ohtani was at the time of his own free agency. Ohtani found stardom in Japan, then came over to MLB at the age of 23, while Soto shot up through the Washington Nationals' minor league system as a teenager. That three-year gap is significant, because those are three more years of prime a Soto bidder will be getting if they land him. Let's perform an exercise. We won't pretend like Soto can match Ohtani's $70 million average annual value (and we'll get into why that number is misleading later). Instead, let's look at the second-largest average annual value a player has received: Aaron Judge's $40 million ($360 million over nine years). It's been a couple years since Judge signed that deal, so let's add $5 million and say Soto could receive $45 million per year. That's an expansive hand wave, but we're in a rush here. Now let's consider Judge is signed through his age-39 season. We could also look at Soto's similarity score on Baseball Reference and see his most similar batter through his age-25 season, who has already played a full career, is Hall of Famer Frank Robinson. By OPS+, Robinson remained an above-average hitter until he retired at age 40. We are doing some back-of-the-napkin math for a very complicated process, but paying Soto $45 million until his age-40 season gives you a 15-year, $675 million contract. Throw in another year, and he's past Ohtani. That would be the longest contract in MLB history, surpassing Fernando Tatis Jr.'s 14-year, $340 million deal, but that's what becomes more possible when you hit free agency at Soto's age. The problem with comparisons to Ohtani's contract is the $700 million is something of a lie. Yes, when Ohtani's paychecks from this contract are all added up, they will total $700 million. However, as most fans know, Ohtani isn't getting that $700 million the normal way. He famously deferred $680 million of that money until after the contract is up. Because of inflation, that means Ohtani won't be getting $700 million in value as we currently understand it. MLB treats the deal like a 10-year, $460 million contract, which sounds positively reasonable when compared to Trout's previous record. Here's the the thing, though: Ohtani wanted those deferrals. He brought it to the table with the Dodgers, who eagerly accepted, because every business in the world would gladly defer the wages of its highest-earning employee by a decade if they were allowed to. Now let's remember Soto retains the services of Scott Boras, the guy you hire when you want the number on your contract to be as large as possible. Odds are Soto and Boras are not interested in replicating Ohtani's generosity, and that means teams aren't going to get the bargain Ohtani gave the Dodgers. Forget who did and didn't make the World Series, the biggest winner of the trade that sent Soto from the San Diego Padres to the New York Yankees might have been Soto. By joining the Yankees a year before his free agency, he became something the Yankees could lose. Much was made about how the Yankees had a year to sell Soto on what he could accomplish in the Bronx, but the opposite is true too. Soto helped slug the Yankees to the World Series in his first year in pinstripes, and now the team is facing the possibility of having to get there again without him. Fans wouldn't like that, especially considering who else is in the running. The three other teams who have meetings with Soto this week are two of the Yankees' division rivals, the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays, and their crosstown rival, the New York Mets. The Mets are the most intriguing option there, because a) they have Steve Cohen, the richest owner in baseball and b) Cohen has made very clear he doesn't care about his team being profitable if it wins. The baseball world knew for years that if the Yankees really wanted a free agent, they were getting that free agent. The Mets have a chance to loudly declare that is no longer true. The best possible outcome for Soto's bank account is for emotions to come into play while Cohen and the Steinbrenner family are making bids, and that seems to be where the situation is trending. Signing Juan Soto will get you a great baseball player. Signing Shohei Ohtani got the Dodgers an international icon, as well as a great baseball player. Maybe there's a more delicate way of saying this, but Ohtani's fame is different than Soto's. Soto could be the second coming of Ted Williams, but Ohtani is the national hero of the third-wealthiest country in the world. Every single company in Japan would love to be associated with Ohtani, and that's why the Dodgers' business side reportedly didn't bat an eye when they were told of a potential $700 million expense. Through sponsorships and advertisements, the Dodgers have already made tens of millions of dollars by employing Ohtani (or even $120 million, if you believe A.J. Pierzynski). That's money Ohtani brings in before he swings a bat, to say nothing of the financial boost the Dodgers got from winning the World Series. Soto doesn't come with that built-in revenue stream. He will certainly help your team win and attract fans, but it's hard to overstate just how big the gap in international fame there is between Ohtani and the rest of the world's baseball players. The easiest way for a contract to go south is for that player to become injury prone. It's more common with pitchers, but we've also seen it with the likes of Ken Griffey Jr. and Mark Teixeira. If Soto's career up to now is any indication, teams probably don't have much to worry about in that regard. Since making his first Opening Day roster in 2019, Soto hasn't missed more than 13 games in a single season. He's also a guy who doesn't rely on tools that could degrade with age. His best tool, plate discipline, is known to age well. Meanwhile, the Dodgers are hoping that Ohtani's second UCL surgery goes well, otherwise they lose what made him the greatest two-way player the game has ever seen. But on the other hand ... If you're going to bet on a guy to be great into his late 30s, it stands to reason you want to bet on the guy who does more things well than any other player in baseball. That guy is Ohtani. Even if Ohtani is no longer the pitcher he once was, the Dodgers reportedly wanted him more for his bat anyway. Then he went ahead and became of the best baserunners in baseball, posting the first 50-50 season in MLB history. And let's not forget, Ohtani occasionally played in the outfield in Japan. With his speed and arm strength, it is quite conceivable he could become a good outfielder again if pitching is no longer an option. He wouldn't be the first Dodger superstar to make a position change for the good of the team. We don't know what Ohtani's game will look like when he's 39, but it will probably still be valuable. Meanwhile, Soto's value is focused entirely on his bat. He isn't a good baserunner and he isn't a good fielder. The contract number that Soto ends up posting will be significant for the rest of MLB. It's hard not to see Ohtani's contract as the ceiling of all possible deals for the foreseeable future, much like Alex Rodriguez once did with his then-Earth-shattering $252 million pact with the Texas Rangers in 2001, but Soto can beat back that narrative this winter. At the very least, Soto appears poised to top Ohtani when it comes to actual contract value, but that could be due to Ohtani's choices as much as Soto's value."

He's set to start Saturday night.,"Tennessee will have its starting quarterback Saturday night against Georgia. According to multiple reports, Nico Iamaleava has been cleared from concussion protocol and will start for the No. 7 Volunteers in Athens vs. the No. 12 Bulldogs (7:30 p.m. ET, ABC). Iamaleava missed the second half of the Vols’ win over Mississippi State in Week 11. On Monday, Tennessee coach Josh Heupel said Iamaleava would be good to go for the weekend. But he needed to get through concussion protocol, a development that became public Tuesday. Iamaleava is 144-of-221 passing for 1,879 yards and has thrown 11 TDs to four interceptions this season. He began the season as a Heisman Trophy favorite, though he’s fallen from that race as Tennessee’s offense has struggled to find explosive plays during its SEC slate. Had Iamaleava missed Saturday’s game, Gaston Moore would have been in line to make his first start. Moore replaced Iamaleava in the second half against Mississippi State and was 5-of-8 passing for 38 yards. Georgia is likely playing for its College Football Playoff life Saturday night. The Bulldogs fell to the first team out of the 12-team bracket in Tuesday’s rankings and would fall further with a third loss. With games remaining against UMass and Georgia Tech, it would seem unlikely that Georgia could get into the playoff at 9-3. Tennessee, meanwhile, may have a path to the playoff even if it loses on Saturday night. The Vols could finish the season at 10-2 with wins over UTEP and Vanderbilt to end the season. That could be good enough to sneak into the field depending on how the rest of the conference shakes out."

This time, the NBA is floating a shift to a four-team tournament for the 2025 All-Star Game, according to ESPN's Shams Charania. Three of those teams would reportedly consist of eight All-Stars each, while the remaining team would be the winner of the Rising Stars Game. Essentially, it sounds like the league either wants to adopt the format of the Rising Stars Challenge, which is currently a four-team tournament, or flip the formats with the All-Star Game. The NHL has also used this four-team tournament for its All-Star Game since 2016. The 2025 NBA All-Star Game is scheduled for Feb. 16 at the Golden State Warriors' Chase Center. Warriors star Stephen Curry is reportedly one of the All-Stars providing input on how to change the All-Star Game and is also in talks to bring back his NBA versus WNBA 3-point challenge alongside Sabrina Ionescu. ESPN reports there would be some variation of that event, which could include other NBA and WNBA players, with Klay Thompson and Caitlin Clark specifically mentioned. You can bet the NBA would be happy to feature the WNBA's league-altering superstar. You don't need an explanation for why the NBA would do this if you have watched a recent All-Star Game. It should be a marquee event for the star-studded league, but is instead a high-scoring slog in which players openly allow each other to score for the benefit of their highlight reel. Last year's game had a final score of 211-186. There have been calls to make the games more competitive (read: have the players actually play defense) and this format might help in that regard for one reason: the Rising Stars team. Teams featuring LeBron James and Kevin Durant might let each other do what they want, but it might be different if one of those teams is facing a team of rookies and sophomores. It comes down to pride for these guys, and the idea of losing to a 20-year-old might actually move them. Until 2018, the NBA All-Star Game featured an East vs. West format in which the players played a typical game of basketball. Here are all the ways the NBA has changed how that works: 2018: The NBA switches from East vs. West to a playground-style team-captain selection process. 2019: The NBA actually starts televising the selection process. 2020: The NBA institutes the Elam ending, in which the fourth quarter is untimed and the teams play first to a certain number of points. 2023: The NBA has its team captains make their picks immediately before the game rather than days in advance. 2024: The NBA goes back to East vs. West and eliminates the Elam ending. The league has seen its ratings dwindle over that span, though the reason it made the changes is the ratings weren't good to begin with. The 2018 All-Star game saw 7.7 million viewers, while last year's event received 5.5 million. That was a bounce back from the all-time low of 4.6 million in 2023."

In the World Series, Graterol pitched in three games, allowing no runs and three hits over 2 1/3 innings with four walks and a strikeout. Los Angeles Dodgers RHP Brusdar Graterol had right shoulder labrum surgery on Nov. 14 performed by Dr. Neal ElAttrache. He’s expected to return to the mound in the second half of the 2025 regular season. — Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) November 15, 2024 The sixth-year pitcher has one more season of arbitration eligibility next year before becoming an unrestricted free agent. In 2023, Graterol compiled a 1.20 ERA in 68 appearances, striking out 48 batters in 67 1/3 innings. He had a scoreless streak of 25 innings during the season. Graterol is one of several Dodgers who are undergoing surgery since the team won the World Series. Shohei Ohtani had arthroscopic surgery on his left labrum after hurting himself on a slide against the New York Yankees. He's expected to be ready for spring training, but rehabbing his shoulder could delay the two-way star's return to pitching. Clayton Kershaw also had procedures on his foot and knee after the season, repairing a torn meniscus in addition to a bone spur, arthritis and a ruptured plantar plate. No timetable has been set for Kershaw's return. The three-time National League Cy Young Award winner and NL MVP made only seven starts last season after recovering from left shoulder surgery last offseason. Additionally, shortstop Miguel Rojas is expected to undergo surgery to repair a sports hernia but should also be ready for spring training. Mookie Betts will move back to the infield next season, but will likely play second base with Rojas and Tommy Edman available to play shortstop."

""The game’s fast. Things happen quick. But you never want to see that.""","Update: Ryan Reaves will have a hearing on Sunday with the NHL's Department of Player Safety, the department announced. Ryan Nugent-Hopkins was disgusted. But it had nothing to do with the 4-3 overtime loss his team had just suffered. About an hour earlier, the Edmonton Oilers winger had witnessed teammate, defenseman Darnell Nurse, being helped off the ice after taking a nasty hit to the head from Toronto Maple Leafs' Ryan Reaves. And while the hit was clearly illegal from a rules standpoint, what Nugent-Hopkins kept going back to was also how unnecessary it was. ""I think it’s a dangerous play,"" said Nugent-Hopkins. ""He’s got to know that Nurse doesn’t see him coming and choose the right path there — he doesn’t. It’s tough to see one of your teammates on the ice like that. Dangerous play.

The Oilers reported that he had an upper-body injury and would not return to the game, but didn't off any more information on his injury. ""I’m worried about the player,"" said Knoblauch. ""Obviously, contact to the head, we don’t want that. I won’t go into details about how severe it was and all that.

Gardner-Johnson made it clear the NFC East runs through Philly, which looks like the case this season even if it hasn't always been the case in the recent past.","PHILADELPHIA — As Philadelphia Eagles cornerback C.J. Gardner-Johnson trotted back to the home locker room, he opened and closed his right palm as if to mime someone talking. “Washington — respect y’all,” Gardner-Johnson shouted. “But y’all know this s*** run through us.” The Eagles had just outlasted the Washington Commanders, 26-18, giving Philadelphia control of its postseason path. At 8-2, the Eagles are now 1.5 games and a head-to-head tiebreak ahead of the 7-4 Commanders in the NFC East. The 3-6 Dallas Cowboys and 2-8 New York Giants are each unlikely to catch up, or even make the playoffs. So Gardner-Johnson, a member of the 2022 Eagles team that won the NFC title game, shared a little of his trademark trash talk. C.J. Gardner Johnson after 26-18 win keeps Eagles atop NFC East: “Washington—respect y’all, but y’all know this s*** run through us.” pic.twitter.com/FJGTMCG2OX — Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) November 15, 2024 He tipped his head to an upstart Commanders team whose rebuild has come together much more quickly than the league imagined. But Gardner-Johnson didn’t want respect only for the Commanders. He wanted respect for his own squad. The Eagles have won six straight. They’ve rounded into form under each of their first-year (in Philadelphia) coordinators, Kellen Moore on offense and Vic Fangio on defense. And while Washington’s lead after three quarters on Thursday signaled what should be the return of a great division rivalry between teams led by Jalen Hurts and Jayden Daniels, the Eagles have already built the caliber of team Washington wants to. Eagles coaches and players resoundingly voiced respect for what the Commanders are again becoming under new leadership in team owner Josh Harris, head coach Dan Quinn, general manager Adam Peters and quarterback Daniels. Gardner-Johnson tempered the praisefest after the Eagles' defense held Washington to 3-of-12 on third down in addition to securing a key fourth-down stop that set the stage for Philadelphia to outscore Washington 20-8 in the fourth quarter (and 20-0 before the last 30 seconds). Daniels completed 22 of 32 passes for 191 yards, the last-minute touchdown and an interception. He also rushed seven times for 18 yards on a day in which the Eagles emphasized containing him. Gardner-Johnson, who had three total tackles and one of Philadelphia’s four pass breakups, spoke to the division pecking order. “We’ve been doing this since before I got here,” he said from his locker after the game. “You know who run[s] this division; no disrespect. That's a great team, but we know what happens. We know what we gotta do. “We hear all the noise, but we understand that we've been winning this division for what, the past three, four years? It’s not a diss or a shot at nobody. “We just gotta understand: Keep what’s rightfully yours. Just keep playing ball.” C.J. Gardner-Johnson respects Commanders. But he said Eagles will keep what's rightfully theirs.""You know who run this division, no disrespect. … We've been winning this division for what, the past 3-4 years?""Cowboys won NFC East '21, '23. Eagles in '22. Washington in 20. https://t.co/NVB2N0v4k4 pic.twitter.com/zhREW4NF15 — Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) November 15, 2024 Gardner-Johnson’s facts were a bit off, excusable perhaps on account that the only prior season he played for Philadelphia, 2022, the Eagles won the division. This year, they have the upper hand to do so. Gardner-Johnson played for the New Orleans Saints from 2019-21 and for the Detroit Lions last year in an NFC North that has become increasingly competitive. Grace aside, the NFC East famously has not fronted a repeat champion since the Eagles defended their title in 2003 and 2004. The Cowboys won the division in 2023, the Eagles in 2022, the Cowboys in 2021 and the Commanders in 2020. The change-of-hands streak is on track to continue this season as a spiraling 3-6 Cowboys team prepares to play its last eight games without franchise quarterback Dak Prescott. (Prescott underwent season-ending surgery to repair a torn hamstring on Wednesday). Gardner-Johnson’s teammates and coaches carried a different tone after their latest win. Even running back Saquon Barkley, who advanced to the playoffs just once in five Giants seasons, was cautious in celebrating regular-season success he had not experienced in New York. “We don’t get a trophy for midseason,” Barkley said. “So at the end of the day, we got to keep going.” The Eagles’ talent collection suggests they will. This isn’t just about a perennially top-tier offensive line now working in tandem with a talent collection featuring Hurts, Barkley and receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. This is also about a front office finding defensive anchors in the draft and free agency, from homegrown defensive tackle Jalen Carter and rookie cornerback duo Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean to free-agent linebacker Zack Baun playing the best football of his five-year career. The Eagles held top Washington receiver Terry McLaurin, who has six touchdowns and four 100-yard games this season, to just one catch for 10 yards. The talent is there. A division title may soon crown it, if the Eagles can keep this pace. Head coach Nick Sirianni’s halftime message to his team on Thursday night applies halfway through their season as well. “It's a street fight,” Sirianni said, “and it's not about who is tougher — but about who is tougher longer.”"

	Jon Jones successfully defended his UFC Heavyweight championship at UFC 309 in New York.","Jon Jones (28-1) knocked out Stipe Miocic (20-5) in the third round to retain the heavyweight championship at UFC 309 from Madison Square Garden in New York.  Jones opened with a couple shots up top, a leg kick, and eventually a takedown. On top, Jones worked the ground and pound, refusing to give Miocic any room on the ground in a dominant first round — but while it looked like Jones could have ended it early, Miocic was able to hang on. Miocic opened the second round with a more measured approach, waiting for his own opportunities to attack without being taken down. The former heavyweight champion was relatively flat-footed before opening a more active approach in the third, but as Miocic moved, it was Jones who picked apart Miocic.  Jones hurt Miocic with a big right hand midway through the round, but kept the champ at bay with a combination of his own. Jones hurt Miocic with a spinning back kick to the body, then finished him off with lefts and rights on the ground before the referee stoppage.  Jones’ return to the UFC on Saturday was just his second bout in the heavyweight division. He hadn’t fought since last year, claiming the UFC Heavyweight belt in his debut in the heavyweight division against Ciryl Gane. Jones is arguably the greatest fighter in UFC history, but his background is riddled in controversy amid two victories over another greatest of all-time contender, Daniel Cormier. Miocic hadn’t fought since 2021, when he suffered a second-round knockout at the hands of Francis Ngannou.  Jones as the winner has an interesting path forward. On one hand, the interim champ, Tom Aspinall, is waiting in the wings and ready to prove himself against an all-time great. On the other hand, Alex Pereira seems prepped to climb to the heavyweight division, making possibly two weight jumps in three year as the former middleweight and current light heavyweight champion. Jones hasn’t seemed as interested in Aspinall recently, but opened the door to that fight after the win.  After his loss, Miocic retired from the UFC."

	Chuck, Shaq, Kenny, and Ernie will continue covering NBA games in 2025, as ESPN will license the show from TNT starting next year.","When TNT Sports lost the rights to the NBA this summer, with the league opting for a three-network deal with ESPN, NBC, and Amazon, the biggest question from fans was what would the future look like for ‘Inside the NBA’. After initially sounding as though it would end after this season, TNT was able to get Charles Barkley to agree to stick around for the remainder of his contract, with plans to continue the show in some capacity.  Now, we know what that will be, and instead of TNT airing the fellas talking about various sports (as was rumored at one point), they will continue to cover the NBA as part of ESPN’s NBA coverage in a unique licensing deal between Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. According to the Wall Street Journal and Andrew Marchand of The Athletic, the deal will see TNT Sports continue producing the show, but it will air on ESPN.  Separately, Warner Bros. Discovery struck a deal with Disney to license the TNT show “Inside the NBA” to ESPN and ABC starting next season, according to the people familiar with the matter. The show, which features the former players Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal, has an enthusiastic and large following. The show will air throughout the course of the season. This all happens alongside a larger settlement between the NBA and WBD, with Bleacher Report and House of Highlights maintaining rights to NBA videos. That is all excellent news for those at TNT Sports and those outlets, and sources inside TNT Sports tell Dime that they are “considering it a best case scenario” after losing NBA game broadcasts. [UPDATE: This post previously stated WBD would continue operating NBA TV and the league’s digital platforms, as was reported by the WSJ, but that was incorrect. NBA Digital and WBD will continue their current relationship but will not be operated by WBD (as is the current structure), while NBA TV will not be operated by WBD in the future.] For NBA fans the biggest news is that Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson will still be on our televisions — one would assume from Studio J in Atlanta still if TNT is producing it — each week during the NBA season. One would expect they’ll move from their Thursday slot to Wednesday for ESPN’s biggest night of games — as the other options are Friday and Sunday and I have a hard time imagining them moving to either of those. The move allows the best show to continue without any changes to talent in front of or behind the camera, which is particularly important, and one would think if ESPN is adding the show they will understand what makes it so good and give it the kind of space and time it deserves, rather than what they currently do with their studio offering. It remains to be seen what happens with NBA Countdown, as they’ll still need to have something for those Friday and Sunday games, but may shake up their main crew with the Inside fellas becoming their A-crew and Finals team."

	The NBA has big plans for how it wants to build on 2024's shooting competition between Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu.","The NBA struck gold at All-Star weekend in 2024. While the game itself was bad enough that the league is considering a major shake-up in its format and the Dunk Contest was a dud, a shooting contest between Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu injected a whole lot of excitement into the festivities on Saturday night — Curry was able to win, but it was awfully close. With the 2025 edition of the All-Star Game taking place in the Chase Center, it would make a ton of sense for the league to run back a Steph vs. Sabrina shootout. According to Shams Charania of ESPN, that is, indeed in the works, but there’s a catch: They may not be the only NBA and WNBA players involved. Curry and WNBA star Sabrina Ionescu of the New York Liberty participated in the first NBA versus WNBA 3-point challenge at All-Star Saturday night this February in Indianapolis. Curry and Ionescu are in strong conversations to return in a variation of the shootout, which could include other NBA and WNBA players such as Klay Thompson of the Dallas Mavericks and Caitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever, sources said. Expanding on the competition and including Thompson and Clark always made far too much sense, so it’s good to see that the NBA might do something that would obviously be a huge draw."

	The NBA is considering a shakeup to make the All-Star Game a 4-team tournament like Rising Stars -- and include the Rising Stars winners.","The last really good NBA All-Star Game was in 2020, which was both the first year of the Elam Ending format and just a few weeks after Kobe Bryant’s tragic death. Players took the game more seriously than we’ve seen in quite some time, as it was a league-wide celebration of the Lakers legend, but since then the game has fallen back into old habits of being a glorified pickup run with barely a hint of defense being played.  That has led to fans tuning out and TV networks being upset, and Adam Silver seemed like a broken man after last year’s game was the highest scoring in history, handing Giannis and the East the All-Star Game trophy with the glowing praise of “you scored the most points. Well, congratulations.” The truth is, the All-Star Game just isn’t important enough for players to go all-out, especially with how much money is at stake for them nowadays. It’s no longer the biggest national stage some of them will get to show out and build their profile, and the result is a bunch of guys trying not to get hurt while producing a few highlights.  For that reason, the league needs to get creative. We offered our thoughts on what that should look like last year, as they’ve bounced back-and-forth between formats and how they pick teams to varying degrees of success. This year we might see a significant change to the format, as ESPN’s Shams Charania brought word that the league is in deep discussions on a new format that would be similar what they did with the Rising Stars Game, breaking the All-Star rosters into 4 teams and having them play a semifinal game and then the winners of those playing in the final. The teams would be 3 teams of 8 All-Stars and the winning team of the Rising Stars Challenge from Friday. Charania highlights how discussions around this format started at Summer League and have included league personnel, team executives, players (including Stephen Curry), and coaches, with significant momentum towards being adopted for the 2025 game in San Francisco. At the very least, you could bet that whatever team of All-Stars got matched up with the Rising Stars winners would likely have a little more juice to not lose, which would yield the intended results of raising the level of competition.  I think anything would be an improvement over a regular four-quarter game, and the Rising Stars games have been improved as a result of this format change. Even if they aren’t suddenly the greatest basketball games in history, they move quicker and when it’s close late the competitive juices get flowing in a way we don’t see often in the current All-Star format."
Sports – UPROXX,It Is Silly That Nikola Jokic Has Somehow Gotten Better To Start The 2024-25 Season,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/nikola-jokic-start-2024-25-nba-season-denver-nuggets/,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 21:41:00 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	Nikola Jokic entered this season as an all-time great already. Somehow, someway, he keeps getting better.","There’s this fun thing I like to do sometimes that I affectionately call the Barry Bonds game. How it works: You go onto baseball-reference, pull up the page for the legendary San Francisco Giants slugger, and just look at how ridiculous it was that Bonds was able to put up the numbers he did during his prime. Yes, steroids, I know, but even with that caveat, individual players are not supposed to break their sport the way that Barry Bonds was able to break the game of baseball. We’re not fully there yet, but going onto Nikola Jokic‘s basketball-reference page is getting to a similarly very silly point. Ever since becoming the no-doubt cornerstone of the Denver Nuggets back in 2018-19, Jokic has consistently put up some of the wildest numbers in the league. His last four years feature three MVPs and a second-place finish while averaging 26.1 points, 12.2 rebounds, 8.7 assists, and 1.4 steals in 34.1 minutes per game while shooting 58.8 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from three. The advanced stats especially love him — scroll on down to the “Advanced” section, a lot of stuff is bold (led the league) and a few things are gold (all-time career marks). There is no one quite like Jokic, and there has never been anyone quite like Jokic. His career True Shooting percentage is third in league history, behind only Rudy Gobert and DeAndre Jordan, while attempting 1,942 more three-pointers than those two combined. His career total rebound percentage is 15th, right in between ABA legend Mel Daniels and Marcus Camby. He’s 25th all time in assist percentage — the three names directly behind him are Ja Morant, Ricky Rubio, and LeBron James. The dude just has his fingerprints all over games in a way that no one has ever consistently matched. I say all of that to say this: Somehow, someway, on a team that needs him more than ever (which says a lot as the entire franchise is built around having him), Jokic has raised his game through the first stretch of the 2024-25 season. This should not be possible. It’s not even like he’s suddenly adding something new to his bag of tricks, he’s just better than ever at being Nikola Jokic. Small sample size caveats are prominent here, but here’s some stuff to consider: Points per game: 29.7 (fifth in the NBA, his current career-high is 27.1 PPG)
Rebounds per game: 13.7 (leads the NBA, current career-high is 13.8 RPG)
Assists per game: 11.7 (leads the NBA, current career-high is 9.8 APG)
Steals per game: 1.7 (t-9th in the NBA, current career-high is 1.7 SPG) The only players to ever average a triple-double over a full season, of course, are Oscar Robertson (once) and Russell Westbrook (four times). Neither of them, in any of their triple-double seasons, were in the same galaxy as Jokic’s current True Shooting percentage of 66.7 percent — both guys, funny enough, posted a TS% of 55.4 percent in their most efficient season with a triple-double. And all of the advanced stats that tend to show that Jokic is a marvel (PER, win shares per 48 minutes, box plus/minus) are outrageous — if the season ended today, he’d post the highest single-season PER (33.31) of all-time, the highest BPM (15.02) of all-time, and the fourth-highest WS/48 of all-time behind some guys named Kareem and Wilt. So, yeah, Jokic is a joke, the single best basketball player in the world today and the guy spearheading a Nuggets team with some flaws that came as the result of a talent drain over the last few years to an early 7-3 record and, as of this writing, the longest-active winning streak (five games) in the Western Conference. And here’s the funny thing: If Denver did not have Jokic playing like this, they would be in some serious trouble. Have a look at how dire things get when he is not on the floor, via PBP Stats: There is a reason why, when asked what the ideal number of minutes is for Jokic to be on the floor for the Nuggets, Michael Malone said “48.” We’ve seen plenty of teams over the years be totally helpless when the sun around which everything revolves goes to the bench — LeBron’s teams in his prime were famously horrendous when he would sit, the Sixers have an organizational commitment to being awful without Joel Embiid, etc. — but seeing as how Jokic is either scoring or assisting on nearly half of all the points that Denver scores, well, it’s pretty important that he never comes off the floor. That’ll have to change at some point (well, probably), but Jokic playing like this means it’s easier for the Nuggets to slowly bring along their young guys who have to take on bigger roles this season — although it must be said that Christian Braun has impressed as the de facto Kentavious Caldwell-Pope replacement. They can also afford to be patient with Jamal Murray, who still hasn’t quite looked like himself on the heels of a pretty nasty run of injuries that made his postseason and Olympic efforts hard to watch at times, but just got paid in a big way and absolutely has to get on track. Of course, at some point, Denver is going to need to totally round into form, even if there are some really encouraging signs beyond Jokic. Aaron Gordon has been awesome so far this year when healthy, while Michael Porter Jr. continues to just do his thing as a huge dude who can shoot the hell out of the basketball. When 75 percent of the core your team is built around is playing at a high level from the start of the year — and that final member of your core has a reputation for saving his best for when the lights get brighter — you’re usually in a pretty good spot. There are still big picture questions that can only be answered when the playoffs roll around, which is the curse of being a team with title-or-bust aspirations. In the meantime, all anyone can really do is sit back, watch, and marvel at the spectacle that is Nikola Jokic, the best player in the world at the very height of his powers, someone who keeps finding ways to break the game of basketball, and an all-time great who stands shoulder-to-shoulder alongside the greatest players to ever set foot on the hardwood. And the scary part? As the early portion of this season has shown, if anything, he’s only getting better."

	'We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust.'","Tonight, November 15, is the much-publicized boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Ahead of the fight, which will stream on Netflix, Iron Mike was asked by internet-famous teen reporter Jazlyn Guerra, a.k.a. Jazzy’s World TV, for his thoughts on legacy. He took it very seriously.   “Well, I don’t know. I don’t believe in the word ‘legacy,'” Tyson replied. “I just think that’s another word for ego. Legacy doesn’t mean nothing. That’s just some word everybody grabbed onto. Someone said that word, and everyone grabbed on the words, and now it’s used every five seconds. It means absolutely nothing to me. I’m just passing through. I’mma die, and it’s gonna be over. Who cares about legacy after that?”  Tyson somehow wasn’t done. “What a big ego,” he continued. “So I’mma die. I want people to think that I’m this, I’m great. I’m, no. We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust. We’re absolutely nothing. Our legacy is nothing.” Guerra responded to Tyson’s stream-of-consciousness existentialism with a polite “thank you so much for sharing that,” but 50 Cent had another takeaway. “G*ddam it! Mike ya scaring the kids, WTF chill,” the rapper wrote on X. “Note to self, keep the kids away from Mike.”  You can watch the video here. Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson streams on Netflix beginning at 8 p.m. ET."
Sports – UPROXX,Ranking The 2024-25 NBA City Edition Uniforms From Worst To Best,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/nba-city-edition-uniforms-ranked-2024-25/,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 18:01:22 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	This year's NBA City Edition unis were officially unveiled on Thursday, so we're ranking them from 30 to 1.","The NBA and Nike officially unveiled the 2024-25 City Edition uniforms for all 30 teams on Thursday, and while the designs have been leaked since this summer, I like to wait until we get the official images to rank them. That is because the actual jerseys themselves almost always look better than their 2D mock-ups, which is certainly the case with this year’s crop. The leaks got roasted to no end on social media and while I’m not crazy about this year’s group of uniforms, they aren’t as bad in actuality as the leaks looked.  That said, there are some heaters and some really bad ones, along with a big crop this year of very “meh” looks as it’s fair to wonder if Nike and the teams are running a bit short on ideas — good news guys, at least another 12 years of these! Here we are ranking the uniforms from worst to best, where there’s one that should become part of one team’s permanent look.  NBA
Creating good alternates is hard when you have an iconic jersey set, and that’s the problem the Celtics (and Lakers) run into every year. These are just bad and don’t even seem to be trying to do anything interesting. Wear your normal (and great) uniforms, please.  NBA
Same goes for the Lakers. These are just unbecoming of a once proud franchise.  NBA
I’m honestly kind of stunned they went back to the Heat Culture well again after the reaction to when they did this last year, but it does look a little better on the all red uniform. Still, c’mon guys, stop trying to make this a thing. NBA
On the opposite end of the spectrum from Boston and L.A. is OKC, which has had one uniform in its history that I thought was legitimately good (the 2018 City Edition honoring Oklahoma’s Native American heritage). Everything else has been either “meh” or outright bad. I’ll say this, these aren’t the worst unis they’ve ever had, but I just am not a fan.  NBA
The Pacers have done this look before in black, and it’s just not for me.  NBA
A retro look that just doesn’t really land for me. I will say, I bet the court they have for this color scheme will look great, but I’m just not a big fan of the lettering.  NBA
I wouldn’t call these bad, they just don’t land for me, but that’s also been the case for a number of the Brooklyn City Editions over the years.  NBA
I’m just out on the 5280 thing. I like the mountains on the side and the topographical map thing, and while I think there are better executions, leaning into the rainbow coloring is generally good for Denver. However, I just can’t get on board with the 5280 in place of lettering. NBA
All of the uniforms in this tier have the same issue of not being bad, but also not being particularly inspiring. Dallas’ are particularly plain, which, again, not necessarily bad, but not memorable either.  NBA
I get they’re going for the Chicago musical font here, but it feels like they weren’t willing to go all-in on it and the end result is pretty bland.  NBA
I get what Minnesota’s going for, but I just see an old Windows 98 screensaver in that design.  NBA
They aren’t as bad as the Lakers and Celtics, but they also have a similar problem where their normal uniforms are iconic classics and trying something new often just makes you want them to do what they always do.  NBA
The Magic are at the top of this group by virtue of having the best lettering/logo — the Magic with a star for the A is always great — but Orlando has great uniform looks and this one just falls flat comparatively.  NBA
Like Orlando, Charlotte has some great throwback looks and this just makes me wish they were wearing one of those instead.  NBA
My colleague Mark said the logo looks like it should be for store brand paper towels and I can’t unsee it. I do like that shade of blue though.  NBA
Perfectly fine, even though it’s still a little confusing when the Bucks are wearing all-blue.  NBA
Never seen a more Oklahoma State jersey in my life. Go Pokes.  NBA
I actually kinda like these, but they are giving off strong vibes of made up Houston jerseys for a movie that couldn’t afford NBA licensing.  NBA
If I were to guess, these will be among the most polarizing unis. I dig New Orleans leaning into being a little different and weird, and the herringbone pattern with actual bones certainly does that. They will likely be at the bottom of some folks rankings but I don’t think their standard unis are so good that they can’t get weird and have it work.  NBA
These have grown on me a bit, in part because they at least look like Warriors uniforms — unlike their Michigan/Marquette alternates from a year or two ago. They aren’t the best uniforms in the world, but a solid attempt at playing off something unique to the Bay (the Golden Gate Bridge).  NBA
I really like the District font and this year they put it on a nice color instead of whatever the hell the black and green and orange thing was a year ago. The Wizards won’t be good this year, but I do think they’ll look good in these.  NBA
I like this Spurs font, they’ve done it before but it works for me. I also like this shade of blue. These aren’t as good as their fiesta look in the past, but a solid choice and I just like when the Spurs have a little pop of color.  NBA
I like these, even though I will not immediately spot this color and go “Cavs” in my brain. Part of why these will work is their court that goes with them is phenomenal.  NBA
Another one that gets a big boost from an unbelievably good court design. These play off the old 1995 All-Star logo, and while I’m not crazy about the font, I still dig them. If they incorporated the saguaro cactus into them, they’d be higher.  NBA
The Blazers almost always do a good job with the City edition uni, and this year is another good addition to their rotation. A big part of that is their “Rip City” font just looks good on anything. NBA
The Jazz are finally making the move back to the purple mountains with their full-time uniform set, and this year’s City Edition is a very good version of that.  NBA
The throwback to the Memphis Sounds just looks fantastic. I love that Memphis font and these are going to look fantastic on the floor — even if it’ll take a little adjustment to seeing a team in red and thinking “Grizzlies”.  NBA
The Kings also have another really good throwback look, taking it to the days of the Cincinnati Royals. The royal blue and red just pops, and they didn’t try to do too much with a uniform that doesn’t need much more.  NBA
I’m a sucker for this spectrum Sixers look. I just think it’s so clean and the white edition is even better than the navy look from a couple years back.  NBA
The Vince Carter Raptor doing his legendary between-the-legs dunk is so good and the Raptors need to just make it their permanent logo. These with the purple retro look they brought back this year is a damn-near perfect uniform set and it’s a shame they will move on to something new next season."
Sports – UPROXX,We’re Picking Winners For Week 11 Of The 2024 NFL Season,https://uproxx.com/sports/nfl-picks-winners-week-11-spread-best-bets/,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:03:27 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	Come get these winners.","Sometimes, you simply want to unplug the season and plug it back in. That is where we are when it comes to NFL handicapping in 2024. After a pair of encouraging weeks, the ugliness returned in Week 10, including a Falcons-Saints game that impossibly stayed under with three missed field goals and other malodies. We won’t be deterred from the goal of righting the ship but, hey, you could also fade these picks if you’re feeling spicy. Before delivering this week’s five-pack, let’s take a look at the carnage in 2024.  Come get these winners. A Thursday night Under? Let’s get back to basics. Washington has been an “over” team to the tune of 7-3 this season, but Philadelphia has been quietly stout on defense in recent weeks. This is, of course, a short week for both teams, and Washington has some injury issues along its offensive line. I tend to think the Commanders defense is a touch undervalued in this spot as well, and this is a favorable price. The Saints got the bounce last week after firing their coach and, with the help of one of the worst kicking performances of the season for Atlanta, New Orleans won a game it shouldn’t have won. That could benefit us this week, as the Browns are underdogs in a spot where they probably shouldn’t be. Let’s ride the Jameis roller coaster and hope it goes well. Detroit is a wagon. They seemingly cover every week and, when they don’t like in Week 10, they somehow win the game despite a million turnovers. With that said, getting a full 14 here on Jacksonville is something I can’t pass on. Trust me, I know how ugly it is. Seattle is healthier and coming off a bye, including the projected return of DK Metcalf. I’ve also been a touch low on San Francisco all season, and I simply can’t get this to 6.5 points, even with McCaffrey back for the 49ers. This teaser happens to involve a pair of prime time games, but I would like it even if it didn’t. Candidly, I love each leg here, with the Bengals more than able to get in the backdoor if things go south at the outset. Houston is on the road, which does scare me a bit, but the situation in Dallas is rather dire, and the Texans may be discounted a bit after a maddening loss to Detroit."

	Giannis got called for a foul despite getting all ball. But fortunately for the Bucks, as Rasheed Wallace once said, ball don't lie.","The Milwaukee Bucks played host to the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night, and while there is still a ton of basketball left to be played this season, you won’t find a more insane final 90 or so seconds of regulation than what we got out of these two Central Division opponents. The two teams traded the lead back and forth, and after a Marcus Sasser three tied things up with just under 30 seconds left, Milwaukee got the ball and had a chance to win. A wide open look by Taurean Prince did not fall, and with a hair over a second left on the clock, Detroit called a timeout, advanced the ball, and tried to replicate the magic it found on a sideline out of bounds play on Tuesday night against Miami. It looked like that was going to happen, as Cade Cunningham lobbed one up to Ron Holland near the rim, but Giannis Antetokounmpo was able to break things up … well, at least it looked like he did, but the referees called a foul that stood after a review even though it really did not look like Giannis fouled Holland at all. However, in the words of the great philosopher Rasheed Wallace, ball don’t lie. Holland stepped up to the charity stripe and missed short twice, which ended up sending the game to overtime. It would’ve been an awfully harsh way for the game to end for Milwaukee, but, again, Sheed’s got us covered here."
Sports – UPROXX,Draymond Green Claims Steph Had Extra Juice For Warriors-Mavs Because Klay ‘Ghosted Him’,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/draymond-green-klay-thompson-ghosted-steph-curry-warriors-mavs/,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:16:08 +0000","<div class=""upx-component upx-embed-url""><div class=""embed-holder""></div></div>Steph Curry apparently had a little extra motivation for Klay Thompson's return to the Chase Center.","Klay Thompson made his return to the Chase Center on Tuesday night as a member of the Dallas Mavericks. It went the way that things tend to go when teams travel to take on the Golden State Warriors: Steph Curry did some absolutely ludicrous Steph stuff, and the Warriors went on to pick up a 120-117 win to start their NBA Cup campaign. Curry scored all 12 of the Warriors’ points during a 12-3 run to close out the game, and plenty of people noted that he looked especially fired up after hitting a three with 27 seconds left that essentially iced things. It turns out there’s a reason why: According to Draymond Green, Curry was ghosted by Thompson in the lead-up to the game. “I’m stirring the pot, I pissed Steph off,” Green said on his podcast, which you can watch at the 4:30 mark of the video at the top of this post. “He’s like, ‘Yeah, I talked to Klay last night about’ — cause he was supposed to speak before the game. He was like, ‘Yeah I called Raymond and told him I’m not speaking. I just need to lock in on the game, so I ain’t speaking and I talked to Klay about it.’ He tried to check in with Klay about something else, and Klay ghosted him, so he got pissed. And here we go. Locked in.” Steve Kerr said that Curry was supposed to address the crowd before the game, but he and Thompson decided against it, while Green did drop a hint after the game that Thompson isn’t an easy guy to get a hold of when he told the press “You ever try to keep in touch with Klay? It’s very one-sided. The love is there. The relationship is there.”"

While the team previously said that Popovich’s absence was due to an illness, on Wednesday afternoon, the Spurs revealed that Popovich suffered what was described as a “mild stroke” ahead of their game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 2, 2024. “The San Antonio Spurs today announced that Head Coach Gregg Popovich has suffered a mild stroke,” the team said in a statement. “The episode occurred on Nov. 2 at the Frost Bank Center. Popovich, who has already started a rehabilitation program, is expected to make a full recovery. At this point, a timeline for his return to the sidelines has not been determined. During this time, the organization is grateful to the extended community for providing privacy and space to the Popovich family.” Assistant coach Mitch Johnson, who has been part of the Spurs’ famed coaching system since 2016, has filled in for Popovich as he’s been away from the team for the last six games. When asked last week for an update on Popovich, Johnson said that the Hall of Fame coach was “in good spirits,” even though there was no word on when fans could expect to see Popovich back on the sideline. One of the greatest basketball coaches of all time, the 75-year-old Popovich has been at the helm of the Spurs since 1996. He is a 5-time NBA champion, a 3-time Coach of the Year, and is the NBA’s all-time wins leader among coaches."

	Let's be honest, Charles Barkley and Shaq were always going to do this at some point.","It’s been a rough start to the year for the Toronto Raptors. While they were never expected to compete for a championship this year, injuries to a number of key contributors like Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickly have played a big role in the team going 2-10, which is the worst record in the league at this early juncture. A bright spot has been the play of Gradey Dick, the No. 13 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who is shooting 37.3 percent from three and his upped his scoring to 20.1 points per game. He’s a good player whose last name has led to stuff like this happening, and shockingly, it was not until Tuesday night that the Inside the NBA guys had their inevitable meltdown over him.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  “This boy’s ballin right here, y’all,” Charles Barkley told the crew. “I think you pointed that out, Gradey Dick,” Ernie Johnson responded. “I can’t say his name,” Barkley shot back. “I just can’t say his name. I’m not gonna say his name, I don’t give a damn what y’all say around here.” It was right around this point that we got one of the consistently funniest things on Inside: Shaq laughing so hard at something insane that Chuck said that he sounds like he’s furiously trying to clear his throat. Anyway, the fellas kept going down this road for a bit longer, because there was never going to be any stopping this riff once it finally happened. As for how the rest of Dick’s night went, he scored a career-best 32 points with five rebounds and three assists in a 99-85 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks."

	There was some extra juice in the building for Klay Thompson's return to the Bay, and Steph reminded the fans whose house it was late.","The biggest game of the night in a packed slate of NBA Cup games was the Mavs taking on the Warriors in Klay Thompson’s first game back in San Francisco since leaving as a free agent this summer for Dallas.  It was an emotional scene as they played a terrific tribute video and had the crowd in captains hats to honor their former star, but once the game got going there was plenty of juice on both sides in a reunion that wasn’t all happy. The two teams went back and forth, as the stars on both sides all played their roles, with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combining for 52 for the Mavs, while Thompson hit 6 threes on his way to 22 points in his return, including a big one late that gave Dallas a five-point lead midway through the fourth quarter.  That lead would get up to seven before Stephen Curry took over for the Warriors, scoring 12 points in the final 3:10 of game time, including a personal 10-0 run (aided by some spectacular defense from Draymond Green) that turned a Golden State deficit into a 4-point Warriors lead. His final bucket of that run was a vintage stepback three-pointer over Dereck Lively II, as he hit the Mavs big man with his signature “night night” celebration, before making a demonstrative declaration to the crowd that “this is my sh*t.”  STEPH CURRY HAS THE LAST 10 WARRIORS POINTS. 10-2 run to put GSW up 4 with under 30 seconds. 🏆 DAL-GSW | West Group C action🏀 #EmiratesNBACup on TNT pic.twitter.com/xNxak7xWr5 — NBA (@NBA) November 13, 2024  The Mavs would hit a three to cut the lead to one, but a pair of Curry free throws and a missed Luka three saw the Warriors win in regulation, 120-117. Curry finished with 37 points in the win, and while it’s clear there’s not actual bad blood between either side in the Splash Bros. breakup, there did seem to be a little extra fire from Curry for a mid-November game to make a statement at home with Klay now on the other side. While the “night night” is nothing new, the jersey popping and yelling “this is my sh*t” was more than we ever see from Curry in a non-playoff environment, and while I am a fan of the NBA Cup and think it brings out more competition in these games, I think this had more to do with who was on the other side than the Cup ramifications of this game."

	Shaq, who is never shy about being brutally honest when modern big men come up, did not mince words about Joel Embiid.","Joel Embiid took the floor for the Philadelphia 76ers for the first time this season on Tuesday night. Embiid, who has spent the start of the year ramping up to play after some knee problems, looked like someone who needs to work off a ton of rust, as he went for 13 points on 2-for-11 shooting with five assists and three rebounds in a 111-99 loss to the New York Knicks. It’s probably safe to assume that Embiid will be fine as long as he can manage whatever is up with his knee, while the Sixers — which find themselves 2-8 at this early juncture — have to get him, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey all healthy and clicking as soon as possible. But even if that happens, Shaquille O’Neal is not optimistic about Philly’s ability to win a ring with Embiid at the center of things, which he expressed at halftime on TNT. “In New York, it’s a tough team to play,” O’Neal said. “But this was the fear I had for Joel Embiid. You announce arrogantly, I’m not playing back-to-backs, Ernie. I’m not injured but I’m sore. I’ll come back when I want to come back. Now, when you say things like that, you’re supposed to come back with extra energy. 0-for-3? I would have been 0-15. But you know what y’all would have said. ‘Hey, Shaq’s not playing well, but he’s playing aggressive.’ The plan that they are having, it’s not working. And not only that, I say this respectfully, Joel Embiid will never win a championship until he gets his mind and his attitude right.” Shaq has essentially staked out a place in the basketball punditry world as the guy who will call out big men when he feels they aren’t living up to what they’re capable of, and clearly, he thinks Embiid is the kind of guy who can lead Philadelphia to a championship. In fairness to Embiid, while he did say he may not play in back-to-backs going forward in an effort to be healthy when the playoffs roll around, he said after the loss to the Knicks that he wants to play in Wednesday’s game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, even if the decision is out of his hands."

In the East Group B, the Detroit Pistons played host to the Miami Heat and looked like they were going to cruise to a win before Miami got hot down the stretch of regulation. With things tied up, the two teams went into overtime, where Miami was able to take a lead with just under two seconds left before things got very, very weird. First, the Pistons drew up a beautiful sideline out of bounds play to get a dunk for Jalen Duren that tied things up. And then, a furious Erik Spoelstra walked onto the court and called a timeout. There was just one problem: Miami didn’t have one, which meant we had a classic Chris Webber situation on our hands — perhaps it was fate that one of Webber’s Fab 5 teammates, Jalen Rose, was in attendance and lost his mind. Malik Bealey stepped up to the free throw line, buried it to put Detroit ahead, then on the ensuing Pistons possession, got fouled one more time with 0.1 seconds left to seal the game. It was, quite frankly, stunning to watch Spoelstra make such a big mistake, but at the very least, we got a really entertaining end to a game that suddenly has some stakes to it because of the NBA Cup."

	Caitlin Clark found a very unique pitfall of fame at The Eras Tour: Getting so many friendship bracelets you start to lose circulation.","Taylor Swift’s “The Eras Tour” has been the biggest show in the world for the past few years, as the tour has had millions of fans pass through the gates at stadiums around the globe. After finishing her international leg of the tour, Swift added another run of U.S. tour dates, which included recently playing three nights in Indianapolis at the start of November.  In attendance for those shows was the biggest sports star in the city at present, as Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark wasn’t about to miss a chance to see her favorite artist play shows in her new home city. The only problem for Caitlin at the Eras Tour was that she’s too popular in Indianapolis, which meant she was being constantly given friendship bracelets from other Swifties. That’s a very nice problem to have, but in her effort to wear every one she was given, it started to create an issue, as she explained at the Women’s Leadership Summit.  “Taylor Swift, I just went two nights in a row in Indianapolis. I’ve been three times,” Clark said. “I had a ton [of bracelets], all the way up the arms. I had to take them off, my circulation was getting cut off! Everyone was just chucking their bracelets at me. I’ve seen her three times, and every time the show has just gotten better.”  She showed off her collection on Instagram during one of the shows and it was a lot of bracelets.  Clark has spent the last year or two learning the ups and downs of life as a superstar, but this is certainly a very unique pitfall of fame, being so popular you get too many friendship bracelets and start to lose feeling in your arm."

	The NBA Cup is back for a second season, and here's how it will all work and what groups each team ended up in.","The NBA’s efforts to add a little excitement to the doldrums of its regular season will return on Tuesday evening. For the second straight year, the league will hold its new cup competition, now known as the Emirates NBA Cup. The first year was fun, with the Los Angeles Lakers winning the whole thing by knocking off the Indiana Pacers in Las Vegas, and now, the NBA will continue its efforts to turn this nascent event into a crucial part of its calendar. What does this all mean? Well, we tried to answer that today by explaining what’s new this year, how the whole thing will work, and why we’re excited to watch this as it tries to become a tentpole event on the NBA calendar. So is this just the In-Season Tournament but with a new name? It is! While the NBA has never explicitly said this, my assumption is that they spent the first year calling it the In-Season Tournament so fans would get a sense of what it is before calling it what they always wanted to call it: The NBA Cup, or more specifically, the Emirates NBA Cup. Or maybe they just couldn’t find a sponsor in the first year. What’s that Emirates thing? I’ve seen its logo on courts but never actually looked into what it is. It’s an airline based out of the United Arab Emirates that sponsors a lot of stuff. They’re sponsoring this event, which is the second-best thing that the NBA does, and fortunately, Emirates has plenty of experience sponsoring the second-best thing, as they are the shirt sponsor for Arsenal. What? Just let me cook. Ok, so, any major differences from last year other than the name? A big one are the courts. Last year, they came under criticism from players (who kept slipping on them) and fans (who thought some were huge eyesores, particularly because of the weird, cumbersome stripe they had going down the middle of the courts). They’re not nearly as bad this year, as they replaced the stripe with rings in the center of the floor and got rid of some of the more abrasive designs that just do not work on television. I’m sure not everyone will love them, but I think they are a huge improvement on last year — we just have to see if players struggle with their footing on them, or else the aesthetic changes do not matter at all. What about point differential? I know some players disliked that. Well, that’s still sticking around as a potential tiebreaker for which teams do and do not advance. Frankly, I think it’s fine and we saw last year that some of the European players were trying to egg their teammates on — Domantas Sabonis was the main one I remember — but it’ll still take a bit of a shift for everyone to get on board with it. Remind me how determining how teams advance will work again? Sure! Right from the league: So the easiest way to move on is to just win your group and not worry about any tiebreakers. That is correct. Well then, what do the groups look like? Once again, the NBA broke things up into three groups of five teams in each conference — this will, hopefully, look a lot cleaner when expansion happens, we get up to 32 teams, and they can do groups of four in each conference where each team plays group games home and away. The group games will happen on Tuesdays and Fridays starting tonight and running through Dec. 3. Here’s how it all looks: West Group A: Minnesota, LA Clippers, Sacramento, Houston, Portland West Group B: Oklahoma City, Phoenix, LA Lakers, Utah, San Antonio West Group C: Denver, Dallas, New Orleans, Golden State, Memphis East Group A: New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Charlotte East Group B: Milwaukee, Indiana, Miami, Toronto, Detroit East Group C: Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington How do these teams qualify for the knockouts? Same as last year — win your group and you get a spot. Both conferences then get one remaining spot for a wild card team, which goes to the best remaining team that did not automatically qualify by winning its group. This is probably where those aforementioned tiebreakers would come in, but you never know. And will the knockouts work like last year, too? Yup! Single-elimination basketball games, with the quarterfinals happening on-site at home arenas and the semifinals and final happening in Las Vegas. The quarters are on Dec. 10 and 11, the semis are on Dec. 14, and the final is on Dec. 17. And are these games all considered regular season games, too? For the most part they are — group games, the quarters, and the semis will all count towards regular season records again, while the championship game will not. So it looks a lot like last year, then. That’s right, the league has, essentially, decided to keep a lot of things the same other than the name and the courts. Oh, also, as a programming note: home teams will wear their Statement Edition uniforms, while road teams wear their Association edition uniforms, according to the league. Huh, well then, ok. You don’t seem enthused about all of this, dear reader. Yeah, I mean, I am still unsure why I should care about this. Well that’s easy: You don’t have to! You’re an adult with agency and the ability to care about whatever you want, times are tough, maybe you don’t want to get super personally invested in a new thing the NBA is doing, that’s fine. But you seem to like this. I do! Why? I think a big split I have noticed here is “fans who like soccer” and “fans who do not,” with the former being more open to the idea of a midseason cup competition — Adam Silver has compared the NBA Cup to the FA Cup in English football, but basically every domestic league has a secondary cup competition. The thing is that these competitions are universally considered not as important as winning the league, but they are still important because it’s an opportunity to win something historic and provide some validation for a team’s season. The NBA Cup is only in its second year, so clearly, it has a way to go before it gets taken that seriously — the whole saga with the Lakers debating putting up a little banner is an example of this. But the FA Cup, for example, is not considered cool because everyone farts around and then Manchester City wins it at the end. It’s considered cool because teams from several levels of English football have a chance to win it, and sometimes, you get magical runs to the very end. We got a glimpse of what that could look like last year when the Indiana Pacers nearly won the whole thing. Hell, if not for the fact that they’re the Lakers, it’d probably be viewed as proof of concept that the final was between a Play-In team and an upstart young squad trying to win something for the first time. That is, to steal a phrase from the English, the magic of the cup. So acknowledging that this isn’t as important as winning the NBA Finals is fine? One-hundred percent. The longer the NBA sticks with this — and, let’s face it, Silver is essentially staking his legacy as a commissioner on this becoming a big deal — the more likely it is that it’ll settle into a spot where fans/franchises like that it is a thing that they can win, all while understanding that the big prize is still waiting for them in June. It helps, of course, that there’s a financial incentive to do well. Remind me what that is. Sure! Players whose teams make the quarterfinals make $50,000, players whose teams make the semifinals make $100,000, players on the runners-up make $200,000, and players on the team that wins the whole thing makes $500,000. Nice. I agree. Anyway, this sounds like, bare minimum, a thing I can have on my television on Tuesdays and Fridays. It is, and really, if that’s all that comes from this for the next year or two, that’s totally fine. Something like this will only become a big deal the more it happens and the more it becomes ingrained as part of the sport’s culture, and as long as this year is a step towards doing that, I’m sure it’ll all work out in the long-run. Nice. Well, I suppose I can tune in. That you can, and if you want to know what games are on, when they’re on, and which networks they’ll be on, you can click right here."

	The NBA Cup starts Tuesday night and we are looking at eight teams that should invest a little extra energy in the early season competition.","The second edition of the NBA Cup (now with a fancy sponsor, Emirates) will begin on Tuesday night as group stage action gets started. Feelings on the NBA Cup vary, but for the most part, it seems to have been at least a mild positive in terms of adding a little juice to November regular season hoops.  Last year, the eight teams that emerged from group play were the Celtics, Bucks, Pacers, and Knicks in the East, and the Lakers, Kings, Suns, and Pelicans in the West. Ultimately, the Lakers beat the Pacers in the final, marking the high point of the season for Los Angeles, while that was just the beginning of a run to the conference finals from Indiana. There are differing views from teams on how they approach the Cup, but because most of the games until you get to Vegas count all the same as regular season games, you should see contenders still trying at least until the quarterfinals where they may punt to avoid adding a trip to Vegas to their schedule.  Not every team has the Cup schedule circled on their calendars, and for some, it gets in the way of the long-term goals (either to get lottery balls or winning a title). But as the Pacers showed a year ago, for a young team without much playoff experience, the Cup can get guys feet wet to that kind of environment and build some confidence for the tournament everyone cares about come April, May, and June.  Here, we’ll look at eight teams that we think should be willing to invest early season energy into trying to get to Vegas and hoist the NBA Cup.   Houston’s gotten off to a strong start this season at 7-4, and I think they’re in a similar position to the Pacers last year, as they can use this as a way to test their young roster without much playoff experience. A successful run to the knockout rounds (and maybe beyond) would be a genuinely big deal for the Rockets, who can assert themselves as a genuine threat in the West playoff race with a strong tournament showing.  We saw that the Lakers were willing to raise their level a year ago in the Cup competition, and it’d be kind of incredible if they went back-to-back. Their group is a bit less daunting now that the Thunder are without Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein (although that’s still an excellent team), and if they make the knockout rounds, a team with LeBron and AD is always going to be a threat in a single-elimination basketball game. We’ll see if they approach it with the same aggression, but this is a team that has to try and chase wins regardless, so I’d expect the effort to be there, even if they can’t replicate the same kind of run.  The Grizzlies want to prove they are fully back as West contenders, and they can make a strong statement if they come out of the aforementioned Group of Death. They are playing at a high level right now, led by Jaren Jackson Jr.’s continued brilliance, and if they can get to Vegas, they’d have a very good chance at lifting the Cup. And if Ja Morant can get healthy and come back in time, absolutely no one will want to see that guy in a one-off. By the time the season is over, the Spurs will likely have filtered out of the Play-In race, but this is the exact kind of team I think should place an overemphasis on the NBA Cup. The Spurs are still building around Victor Wembanyama and figuring out what that should look like, but this team has been fairly competitive early (5-6) and could take advantage of some injury woes for the top teams in their group to try and make a little noise in the Cup. We saw in the Olympics that Wemby loves some heightened competition, and this might be a good chance to turn him loose and make an all-out push for something in November, understanding that they probably don’t have the roster just yet to really threaten the playoffs.  Will the Cavs ever lose? At some point, yes, but why not keep the good vibes rolling as long as possible and try to win the Cup? Yes, they’re a title contender, but unlike, say, Boston, this isn’t a team that’s had any real playoff success. Building some good habits in the knockout rounds could pay dividends down the road, and seeing as how they’re in the same group as the Celtics, I’m sure they’d love to use this as a statement of intent in the event they cross paths in the postseason. The Bucks desperately need something to turn around their season, and maybe the Cup gives them a carrot to chase that can wake things up. I’m skeptical they have the juice to make this happen, as the vibes are just horrendous in Milwaukee right now, but theoretically, Giannis and Dame (who will miss their opener with a concussion) are good enough as a tandem to beat anyone. That will require them to get on the same page, which hasn’t really happened to this point, but perhaps playing on different courts can change the mojo in Milwaukee.  Like every team other than the Cavs and Celtics in the East, the Knicks are off to a sputtering start at 4-5. Their star-studded roster isn’t clicking just yet, the defense has taken a major step back, and the offense hasn’t been quite good enough to make up for it. Their group, at one point, looked like the toughest in the East, but the Magic are without Paolo Banchero and the Sixers … well, we’ll get to them in a second. That cracks the door for the Knicks to try and lay a foundation of winning they can build on as the season progresses and create that chemistry that’s been lacking in games with a slightly bigger game feel. Joel Embiid is back for the Cup games, but Tyrese Maxey is out and Paul George has been on a minutes restriction. This team is desperate to go on a run, and with the big fella back, there’s no time like the present to try and climb out of the East’s basement. Like the Bucks, Philly just needs to stack some wins and get some positivity, and if they can somehow make it to Vegas, they can erase a decent amount of the early season concern about them."
Sports – UPROXX,How Darius Garland And The Cavs Got Their Confidence Back,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/darius-garland-interview-cleveland-cavaliers-confidence/,"Mon, 11 Nov 2024 21:37:23 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	The Cavs are off to an 11-0 start, and we talked to Garland about the work this summer that led to the return of his confidence and smile.","The Cleveland Cavaliers came into the 2024-25 season with plenty of pressure, as this felt like a make-it-or-break-it season for their Core Four. They re-signed Donovan Mitchell and gave contract extensions to Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, while Darius Garland is entering the second year of his own 5-year deal. A ton of money has been committed to this group, with the expectation that they would take another step forward as a real threat in the Eastern Conference under new head coach Kenny Atkinson.  While they can’t fully answer whether they’ve done that until May and June, the Cavs have made an emphatic statement to open the season, as they are the NBA’s last remaining unbeaten at 11-0. That hot start is the byproduct of confidence and trust in their group, something they’ve built over the years but had to fortify by figuring out how everyone can play to their strengths. One of the difficult tasks of building confidence as a unit is that each player has to first have that confidence in themselves. The story of the young season for Cleveland has been strides in that area by the two youngest members of their core, as Garland and Mobley are playing some of the best basketball of their careers.  For Garland, he’s bounced back after a difficult 2023-24 campaign that saw him suffer a broken jaw early in the year and never get fully back to his peak level. As he explained to DIME over the weekend, after missing a third of the season, he wasn’t too interested in vacations this summer, instead opting to get in the gym and build back the strength, confidence, and wiggle that had been missing at the end of last season.  “It’s a total difference. It’s a big difference,” Garland said of how he feels starting this season compared to the second half of last year. “I’m in a good head space right now. I’m fully healthy — some little nicks, but nothing too major right now. And yeah, just came in with a lot of confidence over the summer, put in a lot of work. Especially after last year, I didn’t play a lot of games, so wasn’t a lot of vacations for me this summer, or a lot of hangout time. It was really just strictly in the gym trying to get better, trying to put some more weight and some more muscle on that I lost from last year, from having to jaw surgery. And yeah, trying to get my confidence back, trying to get my wiggle back, and my ball handling and just trying to stay consistent with it.”  Garland’s summer in the gym helped him remember how much he loves the game. One of the lasting images from the end of last season for Garland and the Cavs was Donovan Mitchell on the bench putting his arm around Garland and saying “I believe in you,” as Garland was mired in the midst of a shooting slump. It was a touching moment between teammates, but also telling of how difficult things were for Garland, who had lost his perpetual smile and was finding it difficult to have that same sense of belief.  This season, his confidence is back, as is his infectious smile, and Garland is looking to spread that positivity beyond the court as well. For Veteran’s Day weekend, that means welcoming a pair of Gold Star families from the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) to the Cavs’ games against the Nets and Bulls, as Garland is helping honor a pair of families of fallen veterans from his hometown of Gary, IN.  “It’s super cool just to have some veteran families around me,” Garland said. “My grandfathers were veterans, so just trying to show some love and support for some of the families, and show that they’re loved and that they mean a lot to us, and we know how it is battling some things that they’ve gone through and that they’ve been through. So yeah, just to have their backs and just show that they’re loved and that we really appreciate it.” Both families have ties to Garland, as his mother went to high school with both of the fallen service members. He wants to take the opportunity his platform provides to show them love and do his favorite thing: put a smile on someone’s face. “I try to do it a little bit more often now, especially to kids and those with special needs,” Garland said. “I was one of the kids growing up looking up to Kobe, LeBron, Dame Lillard, Steph, so when I was growing up and they were giving back to younger kids and other people, I just always wanted to do the same. I know that it’ll just make their whole day and change the way that they look at things. So, trying to do it often and just try to put a smile on somebody’s face. That always means a lot to me, because I always wear a smile on my face.”   A post shared by Cavs Care (@cavscare_)  The way the Cavs have played so far this season has put an awful lot of smiles on faces in Cleveland, and Garland credits their hot start to the connectivity of the group and the confidence that’s instilled up and down the roster. This is the third year together for the Core Four, and many of their reserves have also been part of the team for at least a year or two. That familiarity has created a culture of accountability, with Garland noting that from players to coaches to the training staff, there’s a camaraderie that allows for honest conversations that make everyone better.  The newest face in the room is head coach Kenny Atkinson, as he took over for JB Bickerstaff (now in Detroit) with aspirations of taking this group to the next level. Garland, like everyone else in Cleveland, has been impressed with how Atkinson hit the ground running with the Cavs, and highlighted the way he instills confidence in everyone as the biggest thing he’s brought to the team. “He was a player, so he knows what it’s like playing a lot of games, and just having that confidence out on the floor — I mean, when you have that confidence, I think you just get boosted a little bit more,” Garland said. “You think that you can do anything and make any kind of shot, and that’s what our team has right now. We’re shooting the ball with confidence, making plays with confidence, and we’re doing it on both ends of the floor, and I think that’s where he’s just instilling us. Even at film, when we don’t shoot a shot we’re wide open, he’s going to get on us about shooting the ball, because that might be the only good shot that we have in that possession. So he wants us to shoot every ball with confidence, shoot every open one and just keep continuing to play hard and trust each other.” Garland has always been a good shooter, but last season, that confidence in his shot waned a bit, particularly in the postseason. That gave Garland plenty of motivation this summer, where he stripped his game back down to the basics and built it back up with a focus on the little details that go a long way in the games.  “Just trying to pay attention to details,” Garland said. “Just try to do all the little things to make me a better scorer, make me a better shooter. Literally the smallest things, like getting my feet ready, staying down low before I even get the ball. I mean, just literally everything, all the little things. I really went back from square one, from when I started basketball and just worked my way up until I could really start moving and going full speed for the entire summer. So I really went back to the basics this summer, and just tried to clean everything up and just try to polish everything, and getting some of the results back right now.”  The results are the best shooting percentages of his career from every level, with splits of 53.8/47.5/95.0 through the first 11 games. He’s finishing better than he ever has at the rim, a byproduct of the strength he added over the summer, and he’s shooting threes at a higher rate and making more of them than he ever has as a pro. That’s a lethal combination, and he certainly seems to have found that wiggle off the bounce once again, helped by his decisiveness and confidence with the ball as both a shooter and driving to attack the defense.  Garland is far from alone in having a strong start, as the Cavs are finding a way to feed off each other and recognizing how each of them can make the others better. Along with Garland’s return to All-Star form, Mobley has become a bigger part of the offense and is a big beneficiary of that boost of confidence Atkinson has provided. Mobley playing with more force and freedom on both ends of the floor raises their ceiling, and Garland is quick to note how his play opens up so much of the floor for everyone else, calling him “our catalyst.” “He gets us going on both ends of the floor, and he can do so many things, especially on offensive side of the ball,” Garland said. “We can set a 1-5 pick and roll with him, and I go set a pick-and-roll, or Don go set a pick-and-roll for him, and let him just work off that screen. And when he gets downhill he’s a great decision maker, so he’s going to make the right read. We really have a lot of trust in him. We just want him to continue to be confident in his game, want him to shoot some more threes, which is getting better over the years. And yeah, just to be the leader on both ends of the floor, especially defensively. Hopefully he’s All-NBA or Defensive Player of the Year this year, which he’s super capable of, and especially him and JA back there, it’s really tough to get anything at the rim.” The grind of the NBA regular season is impossible to avoid, but the Cavs have found an early comfort in leaning on their depth. At the top, they can play to the hot hand among their stars, but they’re finding an ability to be more adaptable as a roster to change their approach and lineups as needed based on matchups and game flow. With Mobley and Allen, they’ve always been able to go big, but against Brooklyn on Saturday, they closed with a four-guard lineup and showed how they can succeed going small, with Caris LeVert and Ty Jerome stepping in and playing well to close out their 11th win to start the season. As Garland explains, their experiences together, the highs and the lows, have taught them a lot about how they need to play, particularly in late game situations where slowing down and getting stagnant to let one player operate can be tempting, but ultimately plays into the hands of the defense.  “We have so much talent on this team and a lot of depth, so we just have a lot of confidence in everybody, and we’ve been in these situations before. Like I said, we’ve been around each other for a couple years now, so we know what to do. We’ve seen all different scenarios, from being in regular season or the playoffs, so when it’s late game situations, I think that we’re starting to get pretty good at it. And even with our depth last night, Ty Jerome and Caris, they ended the game with us. And, I mean, they made a difference when we went four guards and Evan at the five. It’s just so many different things that we can do because of because of our depth. And we got so much talent. I mean, you really have to just pick and poison, either you’re gonna give up a wide open three or a layup or a floater or something.” Garland and the Cavs know there are no banners to be hung for a fast start to the season, but for a team that just never seemed to hit their stride a year ago, this stretch is a reminder to both themselves and the rest of the league that they do have the kind of ceiling where they can beat anyone. There are still 71 games left in the season, but building the confidence and trust internally early on figures to pay dividends down the road.  For now, the Cavs will look to prolong their winning streak as long as they can, but as Garland notes, they have “bigger plans in May and June” and hope to keep putting smiles on faces in Cleveland deep into the spring."

	Barrett did a literal double-take and couldn't stop from blurting out ""Game of Thrones!""","There is no team that has more celebrities attend their games than the Lakers (the Knicks being a close second), as the courtside seats at L.A. games often go a few rows deep with stars from the world of entertainment. There are the regulars like Jack Nicholson and Denzel Washington, but on any given night you might find an actor from your favorite TV show or movie watching the Lakers play.  That happened to Toronto wing RJ Barrett on Sunday night as the Raptors made their annual trek to Los Angeles. After finishing through contact for an and-1, Barrett turned to the crowd in the corner to celebrate only to find himself face-to-face with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, best known for playing Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones. Barrett realized this mid-celebration and did a literal double take, turned back to Coster-Waldau, pointed, and blurted out “Game of Thrones!” at him before turning around and walking to the free throw line.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  It’s a very funny thing to happen in the middle of an NBA game, but also, that’s exactly how I would react if I turned around and was suddenly face-to-face with the guy that played Jaime Lannister. I feel like this is far from the first time someone has pointed at Coster-Waldau and just yelled “Game of Thrones!” at him, as that is by far the role he’s best known for."

	We caught up with Liv Morgan after she made history as the first Women's Crown Jewel Champion.","Before kicking off the Liv Morgan World Tour, and before becoming the first Women’s Crown Jewel Champion, the current Women’s World Champion sat at home nursing a dislocated shoulder. As Liv Morgan recovered for six months throughout 2023, she says she had a moment of clarity.  Over the first decade of her career, she’d allowed her ring work to speak for itself. During her time away, Morgan took a step back and felt like she had lacked a true voice or character. As she plotted her return to the ring, she created the Liv Morgan Revenge Tour built around the realities of her injury, while envisioning a path back to the top of the WWE mountain.  “The Liv Morgan Revenge Tour,” Morgan tells Uproxx Sports, “gave me such a purpose.” Some of the best stories in professional wrestling have been at least somewhat based in reality, and the way Morgan was injured gave her a motive, direction, and something so personal and true, that it allowed her for the first time in her career to really sink her teeth into a story. “Rhea (Ripley) really did dislocate my shoulder,” Morgan says. “I really sat home for six months watching her ascend to the top of the division. And so it was all really personal to me, and I used all that to come back and do exactly to her what she did to me. But I did that and more.” While she’s navigated trying to find her character throughout a decade in WWE, elements of who Morgan is as a person have helped her continue to chip away at this dream. Her drive, passion, wanting to learn as much as she can, and desire to give herself an opportunity to see what she could achieve has brought her this far.  “(My time away) just gave me the time and space that I needed to really settle into my own, which brought out the best version of Liv Morgan than we’ve seen thus far,” Morgan says.  The last seven months have been a whirlwind for Morgan. She kicked off the Raw after WrestleMania 40 with a beatdown of Ripley that would alter the trajectory of her career. A legitimate shoulder injury suffered in the melee forced Ripley to relinquish the title and led to Morgan beating Becky Lynch for the belt. That win kickstarted the pivotal run of her career, with new twists and turns added by the month.  “I like to believe that everything happens for a reason. Even if you don’t know the reason, I know that’s so cliche, but I really live my life by that. And so even when things happen that I feel are bizarre or even unfortunate things, I always tend to think that on the other side of it, it is going to be for a greater purpose,” Morgan says.  “There’s so much beauty in the madness and it’s cool to be able to pivot and adjust when things aren’t going the way we anticipated it, because we took something that was supposed to be great and we made it even greater. And so I just think that the stars are aligned and everything is happening exactly as it should.” Morgan has embraced the “crazy, messy love triangle” that’s followed her dynamic with Dominik Mysterio and Ripley, “whether they love to hate us or hate to love us.” Mysterio switched allegiances, Morgan joined the Judgement Day while Ripley was ousted, Raquel Rodriguez returned to join her side, and Ripley recently suffered another injury that will sideline her for the foreseeable future. Paired alongside Mysterio and thus far able to hold off Ripley, Morgan isn’t just matching the status quo for a world champion — she’s literally doing things that haven’t been done before.  The latest in her evolution from charting a Revenge Tour to creating a Liv Morgan World Tour came with a championship-worthy diamond ring, after claiming the first-ever Women’s Crown Jewel Championship in a win over Nia Jax last week.  “It means so much to me on so many different levels,” Morgan continues. “We’ve made history in Saudi Arabia. We had the very first women’s title match for the Women’s Crown Jewel Championship. And that is so much progress. I feel like since I’ve started in WWE, all I’ve wanted to do is really carve my own path and see how great I could become. And the fact that I’ve made history and the first and only Women’s Crown Jewel Champion, I am just so proud and so honored. And I just hope that I do it justice.” The opportunities are endless for where Morgan goes from here. She’s open to the idea of a second Evolution all-women’s wrestling show, with a loaded roster across Raw, Smackdown, and NXT.  “I don’t think we need our own show to be more prestigious,” Morgan says. “I think we are prestigious and I think people tune in specifically for the women’s segments and for women’s wrestling. But to give the fans what they want is why I would love to have another all women’s show in Evolution part 2.” A WrestleMania main event is something that’s eluded Morgan across her career, but calls it the pinnacle of wrestling in WWE and is without a doubt an accomplishment she’d love to check off her bucket list. “You can’t get any bigger, higher, better, more prestigious than main eventing WrestleMania,” Morgan says. “I spend a lot of my life dreaming and hoping and wishing. And I’ve been fortunate and lucky and blessed enough to have a lot of those things come true. So yes, main eventing WrestleMania is definitely on my list. With whom, I don’t know what that looks like or what it is but I hope that we can find out together.” Morgan can accomplish just about anything because at this very moment she genuinely has the faith and belief that she can. As she continues to build upon her second world title run, the Liv Morgan we see onscreen every week couldn’t be any more different than the one that was Smackdown Champion two years ago.  “It’s just a different Liv Morgan. The Liv Morgan that won the SmackDown Championship from Ronda Rousey, that girl she was just happy to be there. She maybe didn’t even see herself or believe in herself as a champion yet. She was a girl with just a pipe dream, cash in her briefcase at the right moment in the right time,” Morgan says. “This Liv Morgan is the most confident version of herself so far. This Liv Morgan knows her worth. This Liv Morgan knows she’s the greatest women’s champion of all time. This Liv Morgan knows she’s untouchable. This Liv Morgan knows she has the most dominant faction in all of WWE by her side. That’s the difference.”"

	Holmgren fell hard on his right hip after contesting a shot and had to be helped off the floor without putting weight on his right leg.","The Oklahoma City Thunder entered Sunday tied with the Suns for the top spot in the Western Conference, and figured to face a stiff test with the red-hot Golden State Warriors in town. OKC got off to a strong start, taking a 33-26 lead after the first quarter, but there was some considerable concern about their star big man as Chet Holmgren had to be helped off the floor and into the locker room after landing hard on his right hip after contesting an Andrew Wiggins layup attempt at the rim (watch here).  Holmgren slams down onto the hardwood and immediately grabbed at his right hip in pain. He was ultimately helped off the floor and into the tunnel without putting any weight on his right leg by a pair of Thunder staffers. Holmgren has gotten off to a tremendous start to his sophomore campaign, averaging 18.2 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.9 blocks per game coming into Sunday’s contest, asserting himself as a serious threat for DPOY with his work protecting the rim for the league’s best defense so far.  The Thunder will hope Holmgren’s injury was just a painful fall and not something more serious that could lead to an extended absence, as they are already incredibly thin at the center position with Isaiah Hartenstein still out with a fractured hand.  UPDATE: Holmgren was ruled out for the game with what the Thunder officially called a right hip injury. Shams Charania reported later Monday night that Holmgren would miss 8-10 weeks with a hip fracture."

	Giannis played a little prank on Jaylen Brown after catching him with an elbow, but the Celtics star wasn't a big fan of Giannis' antics.","The Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics have had two very different starts to the season, as the defending champs have picked up where they left off with another strong beginning to their repeat bid, while the Bucks have been one of the NBA’s worst teams despite having a healthy Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo.  It has not been the kind of start Milwaukee envisioned, and they were hoping to kickstart a turnaround on Sunday when they played host to the Celtics with a chance to alleviate some of the panic about the team’s start by beating one of the league’s best. As they’ve done on a few occasions this season, the Bucks came out hot, scoring 40 in the first quarter to take a double-digit lead, but couldn’t maintain that offensive output, scoring just 38 in the entire second half to see the Celtics pull ahead and pull away for a 113-107 win.  During the game, Giannis and Jaylen Brown had an interesting exchange, as Antetokounmpo elbowed Brown in the head on a post move and then hit Brown with a fake handshake as they went back down the court, which Brown didn’t seem to appreciate.   A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston)  After the game, Brown gave some brief, but unfiltered thoughts on the exchange. “Giannis is a child,” Brown dead-panned. “I’m just focused on helping my team get a win, and that’s what we did tonight.”  Giannis certainly wasn’t the chief culprit for the Bucks struggles on Sunday, as he had 43 points and 13 rebounds, but this kind of silly exchange doesn’t quite land as well with fans when the team is falling to 2-8 on the season, with the only team worse than them in the East being the Embiid-less Sixers."

	The Chiefs moved to 9-0 after blocking a 35-yard kick by Denver with one second left that would've won the game.","The Kansas City Chiefs entered Sunday as the NFL’s last remaining undefeated team at 8-0, and were heavy favorites to move to 9-0 at home against their divisional rival from Denver. However, the Chiefs offense, which has been sluggish at times this season, could not finish off drives with touchdowns and allowed the Broncos to hang around all game.  On Sunday, it looked like that would finally catch up to them and result in a loss, as the Broncos moved the ball inside the Chiefs 20 on their final drive of the game, trailing 16-14, setting up a 35-yard field goal attempt for the win by Wil Lutz. However, the Chiefs special teams unit still had at least one more miracle in them, as George Karlaftis, Leo Chenal, and company caved in the left side of the Broncos field goal unit and blocked the kick to preserve the 16-14 win.  A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  It’s an insane way for the Chiefs to win that game, as they were completely unable to run the ball (19 carries for 57 yards, 19 yards coming from Patrick Mahomes scrambling), missed a number of big play opportunities and had to settle for field goals, and gave up a critical late game drive deep into their own territory. And yet, they move on to Week 11 at 9-0 on the season with a schedule that isn’t the most difficult if they can get past a road trip to Buffalo next week — although, as Sunday proved, division games can always get weird."
Sports – UPROXX,The Bucks Have ‘Called The Whole League’ Trying To Find A Trade After Their Awful Start,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/milwaukee-bucks-trade-rumors-called-whole-league/,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 22:30:53 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	The Bucks are trying to find a roster upgrade, but with their cap situation, they're finding it nearly impossible despite their best effort.","The Milwaukee Bucks came into the 2024-25 season hopeful that having both Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo fully healthy and coming off a full training camp together would vault them back into being a threat in the Eastern Conference. Instead, the Bucks are 2-6 with their only wins over the tanking Jazz and the Sixers on opening night — who were without Joel Embiid and Paul George and have also looked awful to start the season.  It’s been rough on both sides of the ball for the Bucks, as they are in the bottom half of the league in both offensive and defensive rating through the first few weeks of the season, and while things should improve if and when Khris Middleton can get back healthy for an extended period of time, it’s also pretty clear this roster has some flaws in need of fixing. The problem for the Bucks is, as a second apron team, making a trade is extremely difficult, as they’ve found out the hard way recently.  On Friday’s episode of NBA Today, Brian Windhorst said the Bucks have “called pretty much the whole league” trying to find a trade that could improve their roster, but have run into the same issues with just about everyone.  “The Bucks are doing something that we don’t see very often, which is scouring the trade market in the first week of November,” Windhorst said. “As I was talking to teams this week, they were like, ‘The Bucks just called. The Bucks just called.’ I think the Bucks right now are just kind of searching and trying to cover their bases. And by the way, Giannis is not on the table, Dame is not on the table, they’re looking to try and (find) help for some of their wing play — Khris Middleton’s absence has been extended.  “I talked to one team who said, ‘Yeah, we talked to the Bucks. We came up with two or three different scenarios and realized we’re not allowed to make any of those trades.’ The Bucks are hemmed in as a second-apron team with the new rules. They can’t aggregate players together, they can’t put like two or three players together in a trade. They can’t do a trade where they bring in more money. They have traded away the next six first round picks, either the picks or the swaps, they have traded away the next six second round picks. They are $75 million in the luxury tax. I don’t think help is on the way through the trade market. But they are making calls, which is interesting because from what I can tell, they called pretty much the whole league.” The two players the Bucks were reported to be shopping over the summer (and even last trade deadline) were Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton, but as Windhorst notes, being unable to aggregate those salaries together means they have to find a player to trade for that matches salary exactly or makes just a little less than either of those two. Given Portis makes just over $12.5 million and Connaughton makes just under $9.5 million, that’s a tough thing to do if the goal is to add a strong contributor for a contender. As such, Windy doesn’t expect them to find a miraculous deal out there, and it sounds like, despite the front office’s best efforts in working the phones, it’s going to come down to this roster to turn things around in Milwaukee."

	Come get these winners.","More than half of the 2024 NFL regular season is over. That reality is painful for those enjoy consuming every aspect of professional football and, in this space, things haven’t gone particularly well. In fact, it was largely a disaster for the first seven weeks but, after back-to-back winning performances, optimism is beginning to creep in.  Would it have been better if the Cleveland Browns or Green Bay Packers could’ve taken care of business last week? Certainly. But here we are after a 3-2 showing. Before handing out this week’s selections, let’s take stock as we dig out of the hole.  Come get these winners. I am actually quite high on the Bills dating back to the summer, but I can’t get them to -4 here. Buffalo is riding high with a four-game winning streak, which helps to explain the number, and Indianapolis has flopped with two straight losses. Still, Joe Flacco and company shouldn’t be getting a full four at home, and we have to take the candy. This is just a principle play. We’re taking advantage of a Wong teaser here, sending Pittsburgh through a pair of key numbers and doing the same with Kansas City. The Steelers have been a wagon as an underdog under Mike Tomlin. The Chiefs will eventually lose (I think) but it won’t be here.  As noted a week ago, this credit goes to UPROXX editor Robby Kalland, but NFC South overs are unbeaten this season. Perhaps that will come to an end here, but Atlanta’s offense can put up points in bunches and its defense is capable of letting the Saints hang around. Let’s go touchdowns. I have to admit that I hate this. I know my editors will hate this. But Los Angeles is laying more than a touchdown with a total in the 30’s? It isn’t as if the Chargers have a real home-field advantage either. I’m holding my nose as I type this, but I simply must. New York has been a sharp side all week, and that makes sense. I couldn’t quite give out the Jets in an awesome spot last week, but I think this is a sell-high spot on Arizona after their blowout win over Chicago. Take me there, Aaron Rodgers."

Earlier this month, fans of Kelce’s holiday project with his former Philadelphia Eagles teammates Lane Johnson and Jordan Mailata heard the first track off of their upcoming album A Philly Special Christmas Party, which featured Kelce teaming up with his brother, Travis Kelce, and Boyz II Men on the track “It’s Christmas Time (In Cleveland Heights).” Kelce collaborated with another legendary artist for the latest track off of the upcoming release, as he recorded a duet with Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks. The track, a cover of Ron Sexsmith’s “Maybe This Christmas,” got teased on the project’s Instagram account over the last week and on the latest edition of the Kelce brothers’ podcast, and was officially unveiled on Friday.  A post shared by A Philly Special Christmas (@aphillyspecialchristmas)  “There are no words to describe how incredible it is to have Stevie Nicks on this record,” executive producer Conner Barwin said in a statement given to Rolling Stone. “There is so much emotion in this song, and it was thrilling to be with them in the studio and watch her and Jason connect, be creative together, and witness this beautiful song become a reality.” A Philly Special Christmas Party will come out on Nov. 22, 2024, but if you’d like to listen to the new track, you can do that right here."

	NBA players have been appearing in music videos for years, and today, we highlighted some of the best cameos.","NBA players and musical artists have always been close with one another. One frequent way that we’ve seen that over the years is music videos, as NBA players have frequently made cameos in them, whether they’re just showing their face for a moment or they’re a main character in the story that an artist is trying to tell. Today, we wanted to highlight some of our favorite appearances that NBA players have made in music videos over the years. Players from a number of different eras — and songs from a number of different genres — made it on the list, but all of them feature artists making it a point to get some of the biggest names in basketball into their videos. This wasn’t the only time Kobe linked up with Destiny’s Child — he recorded a verse on a remix of their track “Say My Name.” He does have a cameo in the video for “Bug-a-Boo,” though, as Destiny’s Child — which is trying to get away from a group that is bugging them — dips into a locker room. While going through there, they come across Bryant, who is sitting there and getting ready to play basketball. MJ and MJ just had to appear in a music video together at some point, no? The two appear on a basketball court and shoot hoops with one another, and at one point, Michael (Jackson) teaches Michael (Jordan) some dance moves. These might have been the two most famous people in the world when this video came out in 1992, and it’s a pretty remarkable cultural artifact. The newest release on this list, DeRozan was one of the many celebrities who made a cameo in Lamar’s summer anthem that doubled as the high point of his feud with Drake from earlier this year. It turns out DeRozan has known Lamar for quite some time, and while he said he still has love for Drake despite appearing in this video, well, it sure seems like there might be some tension here. Shaq, as we’ve laid out before, has been in a ton of music videos over the years. His first was the iconic “Make ‘Em Say Uhh!” video, where he sits courtside and looks like he’s having the time of his life as Master P and co. put on a show on the hardwood. One of the biggest music videos of all time — it’s a little more than 14 and a half minutes long, and is absolutely jam packed with some of the biggest names in sports and entertainment at that time. Names like Deion Sanders, Rickey Henderson, and Wayne Gretzky make cameos, while the NBA is well-represented with two members of the Dream Team and, uh, a third player who was almost on the Dream Team. Easily the most … unique video on this list. It features Jimmy Butler dressed up in what I can only describe as an emo cowboy costume and really committing fully to the bit. (The bit, of course, is “Jimmy Butler dressing like this in a Fall Out Boy video.”) There is no one in the NBA quite like Jimmy, and this video is a pretty good example of why that is the case."

	Travis Kelce caught a stray on 'Jeopardy!.'","Travis Kelce has long been one of the NFL’s most visible stars, but recently, he has achieved a new level of widespread cultural notoriety thanks to his relationship with Taylor Swift. Jeopardy! made a nod to that during the November 6 episode. In the episode’s opening round (per J! Archive), the $200 clue in the “The TV Show In Question” category read, “Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? is hosted by this man who’s maybe more famous as a BF than as a 3-time Super Bowl champ.” Contestant Derek Hieronymus correctly responded with Kelce. Here’s a video of the moment. This came shortly after Jeopardy! found itself in a bit of hot water. As USA Today notes, Heather Ryan, a contestant on the October 28 episode, recently spoke out about a clue that read, “Men seldom make passes at…,” with the correct response being, “Girls who wear glasses.” She said, “It is definitely an odd choice. I think it made everybody in the audience and on stage — and Ken Jennings, too — a little uncomfortable. It was like, ‘Oh, that was unexpected.’ Maybe we choose better rhyming phrases in 2024. […] Unfortunately, there are still girls who are (in) middle school, and they don’t want to wear their glasses and they’re losing out on their education. So, I think it’s much better to be able to see than anything else.” Jennings apologized following the incident, saying, “A little problematic, sorry Heather.”"

	Vivek Ranadive has unsurprisingly taken DeMar DeRozan's side in his simmering feud with Drake.","The Toronto Raptors traveled to Sacramento to take on the Kings on Wednesday night in a game that has suddenly given us a little spiciness off the court. Sacramento went to Toronto on the night of Vince Carter’s jersey retirement ceremony last week, which was the first time that DeMar DeRozan played in front of Drake since he appeared in the music video for Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us.” While DeRozan, in the immediate aftermath, said he has tons of love for Drake despite his cameo in the video, Drake expressed that he doesn’t want to see DeRozan get his number retired in Toronto when his career comes to an end, and DeRozan seemed to have a lot of fun responding. And on Wednesday with Drake’s beloved Raptors in town, Kings owner Vivek Ranadive decided to show some support to his star forward by wearing a shirt with the words “THEY NOT LIKE US” on it.  A post shared by SLAM (@slam)  The Kings picked up a 122-107 win on Wednesday to move and 5-3 on the season. All five starters scored in double-figures for Sacramento, with DeRozan leading the way with 27 points on 11-for-21 shooting. It is unclear if he was motivated by the fact that the team’s owner showed up and wore a shirt that trolled Drake, but I’m sure at least part of him appreciated it."

	Windhorst thinks the Warriors have an ""itchy trigger finger"" when it comes to trade talks and chasing another star.","The Golden State Warriors picked up a big early season win on Wednesday night when they defeated the Boston Celtics to improve to 7-1 on the young season and offer an early confirmation point that their hot start is the real deal after beating a number of teams in the middle and bottom of the standings.  The Warriors’ depth has been showcased during their hot start, but this is a team that was very active on the trade market this summer trying to land another star-level player to fit between Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. Paul George and Lauri Markkanen were well known pursuits of the Warriors, and their hot start may only further embolden the front office to go star-chasing during the season.  As Brian Windhorst laid out on Thursday’s First Take, the Warriors are the team he most expects to make a splash trade this season, as they have the contracts, young players, and draft assets to make a competitive offer for just about anyone.  ""The Warriors are the biggest candidate in my mind to make a big trade. They tried to trade for LeBron James last trade deadline… This is a team that's got an itchy trigger finger trying to make a big deal."" – Brian Windhorst 👀pic.twitter.com/0wYql9bYW4 — ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) November 7, 2024  Windhorst notes this front office seems to have an “itchy trigger finger” when it comes to trade talks, noting their efforts at landing another star date back to last deadline when they called the Lakers about LeBron. While a move isn’t imminent and they’ll likely ride this wave of positivity for awhile, by the time 2025 arrives and trade season kicks into full gear, they should be seen as a top threat for any star that comes available. We know the likes of Brandon Ingram and Zach LaVine are still available, but that was the case this summer and the Warriors seemed to balk at making a move for either of those two players. Instead, it seems Golden State is keen to wait to see if someone else comes available they could make a run at, but Windy, at the very least, would be very surprised if this Warriors roster looks the same by mid-February when San Francisco is hosting the All-Star Game."

	We caught up with Mercedes Moné to discuss her return from injury, regaining confidence, and how she's blazing a trail for the AEW women.","The last year has been a whirlwind for Mercedes Moné, and more than six months into her AEW tenure, there’s plenty to be grateful for.  What was once considered a career-ending ankle injury could have sidelined Moné for good, she refused to accept the possibility of her childhood dream being over, instead choosing optimism, and willing herself back into the ring. “It’s really just leading with gratitude, thankful to be a part of this wrestling community still,” Moné tells Uproxx Sports. “The last year was the craziest year of my whole life, not knowing where I was going to be in wrestling, but leading with gratitude and staying positive.” Moné landed in AEW in March, carrying the same mindset she’s had throughout her career as she’s trail blazed a new path for women’s wrestling.  “(I knew) where I wanted to be and what I want to leave in professional wrestling, to take this women’s division to whole new heights all over the world,” Moné says. “I wanted to have more for women’s wrestling, so I knew going to AEW was the place to be to make that happen. I feel like the women’s division has really changed the game. The women’s division has been the best it’s ever been. The women’s storylines are headlining AEW pay-per-views. So it’s just been amazing to come this far and I’m really excited for more.” For most athletes, an injury the severity of Moné’s typically requires at least two years to be back at full strength. She says she feels amazing being back in the ring and admits the toughest part of this journey is in the past.  “For me, it was just mentally going into the ring and training and being like, okay, I don’t want to be scared of climbing the top rope. I don’t want to be scared of jumping off the top rope. I don’t even want to be scared of running, because due to my injury, I couldn’t walk for over three months,” Moné says. “So just telling myself that I still got this. I got to train with Tyler Breeze for three months preparing myself for my AEW debut. And it was just getting my confidence back in the ring. That’s what really took some time. But now I’m feeling better than ever, and here I am as two belts Moné, so I’m feeling great.” After returning to the ring in May, Moné was quick to find gold around her waist. She defeated Willow Nightingale to earn the TBS title before claiming the NJPW STRONG Women’s championship just a month later. After sitting in the stands at All In at Wembley Stadium last year, Moné battled Britt Baker in London this year. She’s continued to find her footing in matches against Hikaru Shida, Emi Sakura, and most recently, Queen Aminata.  Moné isn’t just talking the talk, she’s leading the AEW women’s division to new heights and opening doors to elevate talent across the roster.  “I was born to be the best. I was born to have this purpose of leading a charge of making sure that women’s wrestling is known and respected and it deserves the respect that it’s given,” Moné says. “So just leaning on the standard that I put for myself, I’m here to be the best, to show the world that I’m the best, and I’m here to bring the women along with me. So that’s the goal.” While she has her eyes firmly on her next challenger for the TBS championship, Kris Statlander at the Full Gear pay-per-view on November 23, Moné isn’t stopping at defending the belts already in her possession. Mariah May told me ahead of All In earlier this year that she’s interested in mixing it up down the line with Moné, a dream opponent for the talented AEW Women’s champion. When — and if — that match happens remains to be seen.  Moné is never one to shy away from a challenge and says she’s “coming for all the titles” in AEW, while offering praise for one of the promotion’s brightest young talents. “I am super proud to watch from afar. She came in as a super fan, just loving wrestling, loved it so much that she moved from England to Japan, trained out in Stardom just to hone her craft, and now she’s here,” Moné says.   “She is our women’s world champion, beating Toni Storm in one of the best storylines in women’s history. So to see her rise this fast and to see how good she is in the ring, it’s so incredible. Like I said, we have the best women’s division in the game right now. And I’m definitely looking at the title that she has around her waist.”"

	Morant and the Grizzlies beat the Lakers at home for the first time since their tense playoff series in 2023.","Ja Morant and the Memphis Grizzlies took down the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night. It was the first time that Morant got to play L.A. at home since the two teams went head-to-head in a tense playoff series back in 2023 — Los Angeles won in six games — and Morant sure did play like he still has that postseason failure on his mind. In the 131-114 Grizzlies win, Morant tied for the team high with 20 points, along with five assists, four rebounds, a steal, and a block. At one point, he scored over Gabe Vincent and hit him with a too small … only for LeBron James to come back on the very next possession and get him right back.  Ja Morant gave a ""too small"" to Gabe Vincent, and then LeBron gave it right back to Ja 😅pic.twitter.com/0N3OnwlMu1 — Dime (@DimeUPROXX) November 7, 2024  After the game, Morant spoke to the media, and after saying that James’ too small was done “respectfully,” he expressed that he really does not like the Lakers. “I don’t like ’em,” Morant told the press. “They knocked me out the playoffs … they beat us last time, I didn’t get to play, like I said, last year. They came on our home floor, beat us on our home floor, was laughin’, playin’, lookin’ at me, talkin’. My message was, I was in street clothes. This is my first opportunity to get back on the floor playing against them.” As for the whole “getting a too small for LeBron” thing, well, Morant took to Twitter after the win and addressed that."

	JJ Redick was blunt when asked why his starting guard got benched in the third quarter of Wednesday's loss to the Grizzlies.","The Los Angeles Lakers fell to the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night, 131-114, as they attempt to navigate what has been a pretty difficult spate of injuries. One guy who hasn’t been injured, though, is starting guard D’Angelo Russell, although he saw his minutes cut on Wednesday — Russell came out of the game with 5:54 left in the third quarter, did not reenter, and only played 21:33 on the evening. New Lakers coach JJ Redick decided to close the game with Gabe Vincent on the floor, and after the game, he was asked why he kept Russell on the bench. As he explained, part of it was just wanted to see what Vincent gave him, but with Russell, there were some things that he did not like to see. “Level of compete, attention to detail, some of the things we’ve talked with him about for a couple weeks and, at times, he’s been really good with that stuff, and other times, it’s just reverting back to certain habits,” Redick told the press after the game at the 3:05 mark of the above video. “Wasn’t like a punishment, just felt like for us to have a chance to win this game, that was the route we wanted to take. Gabe, in the first half, especially defensively, was fantastic, and I just wanted to see what that looked like.” Russell went 4-for-12 from the field for 12 points, three assists, and two steals before his evening came to an end."

	Miller had 19 points on the night, with his biggest bucket coming as the clock hit zero.","The Charlotte Hornets are built around a young and exciting 1-2 punch in LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller. On Wednesday night, both of the franchise’s pillars needed to come up big in order for Charlotte to pick up a 108-107 win over the Detroit Pistons, with Miller, in particular, playing the hero in the waning moments of the game. After a turnover by Miller, the Pistons went the other way and got a layup from rookie forward Ron Holland to take a 1-point lead. On the ensuing possession, the Hornets were able to get a good look for Grant Williams, who pulled up from behind the three-point line but was not able to convert. Fortunately for everyone in Charlotte, Miller was able to sneak his way into the lane and clean up the miss. He immediately attempted a layup, which went in and gave the Hornets their third win of the season.  A post shared by SportsCenter (@sportscenter)  It wasn’t the most productive night for Miller, who had 19 points on 6-for-16 shooting with six rebounds and four assists. But he got the biggest two points of the evening, so it’s safe to say that he had a pretty good evening. As for his star running mate, Ball had 25 points, eight assists, six rebounds, and two steals."

But they are determined to make the mogul proud, one up their rivals, and bring the school’s band program into a new era. Though the reaction to the planned performance is mostly love, Mills has gotten a bit of trepidation from alums worried about “protecting certain traditions.” He’s not deterred though, “This yields an opportunity to say ‘Look, I got it.’” Blaze, on the other hand, couldn’t be more excited about the collab. “I’ve been waiting for this moment all my life, and didn’t even realize it until now.” He’s not the only person thoroughly anticipating a great performance. Denise Saunders Thompson, Assistant Dean to the Chadwick Boseman College of Fine Arts, takes time out of her busy schedule to meet Mills, Blaze, and the band on the field to complement and encourage their progress. “Were gonna break the internet with this performance,” she tells the group, hoping to manifest this new standard-setting moment with her words.

	Embiid has not played yet this season, but his suspension will not go into effect until after he is eligible to play.","The Philadelphia 76ers will have to wait a little longer for Joel Embiid to play in his first game this season. On Tuesday afternoon, the NBA announced that Embiid received a 3-game suspension following an incident in the locker room on Saturday night where he shoved a member of the media. It is believed that Embiid shoved Marcus Hayes of the Philadelphia Inquirer, who recently published a column criticizing Embiid over not playing this season that referenced his son and late brother, which upset the former NBA MVP. “Mutual respect is paramount to the relationship between players and media in the NBA,” Joe Dumars, the NBA’s Executive Vice President, Head of Basketball Operations said in a statement. “While we understand Joel was offended by the personal nature of the original version of the reporter’s column, interactions must remain professional on both sides and can never turn physical.” Embiid criticized Hayes earlier in the week during a media availability, but he was not in attendance. In its statement, the league announced that Embiid — who has been working his way back from a knee issue — will not start serving his suspension until he is eligible and healthy enough to play. The Sixers have gotten off to a slow start this season without Embiid, as the team is 1-5. Their high-profile offseason addition, Paul George, only just made his regular season debut on Monday night against the Phoenix Suns after getting hurt in the preseason."

	Lou Williams wasn't a fan of what Drake said about DeMar DeRozan on the night the Raptors retired Vince Carter's jersey.","The Toronto Raptors retired Vince Carter’s jersey last week, the highest honor the team can give to one of the most iconic players in franchise history. The game happened against the Sacramento Kings, which are the current team of someone else who will probably get his jersey retired by the Raptors some day, DeMar DeRozan. While the night was all about Carter, there was some tension between DeRozan and noted Raptors fan Drake, which presumably all revolves around DeRozan appearing in the music video for Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us.” The whole ordeal rubbed former Toronto player Lou Williams the wrong way, which he expressed on FanDuel’s “Run It Back.” “If I’m gonna speak candidly, I thought that was selfish of Drake,” Williams said. “Drake, as well as the country of Canada, the city of Toronto, they know what DeMar DeRozan has contributed to the culture up there, and what he’s contributed to the Toronto Raptors, and to that community. It goes way bigger than his personal relationship with Drake, it goes way bigger than his personal relationship with Kendrick Lamar. So for Drake to say, ‘If you put up a banner and I’ll personally pull it down,’ it’s like, is it just about you or is it about the Toronto Raptors?” Drake expressed during the game that if the Raptors put up a DeRozan banner, “I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.” DeRozan was asked to respond to this after the game and told the press that “He gonna have a long way to climb to take it down. So, tell him good luck.” The following day, DeRozan posted a clip from Friday to his Instagram Story, and it’s not hard to read between the lines that he was talking about Drake."

	Caitlin Clark is excited to play for an Indiana legend, and saw how she had the Sun prepared and thinks that'll make the Fever better.","More than half of the WNBA is changing coaches this offseason, as seven of the league’s 13 teams parted ways with their head coach from the 2024 season — and the Golden State Valkyries are entering the league with a new coach as an expansion franchise. Among the teams that fired their coach after the season was the Indiana Fever, as they let Christie Sides go after guiding Indiana to a second-half push that saw them nab a playoff berth before a first round loss.  The Fever figured to be a highly coveted job as it provides an opportunity to coach the last two Rookie of the Year winners in Caitlin Clark and Aliyah Boston. On Monday, the team officially introduced Stephanie White as their head coach, after White parted ways with the Connecticut Sun to return home to Indiana to take the Fever job for the second time in her career. This time, White takes over a roster that has a ton of talent, and in her intro presser she stated her belief that Clark and Boston can be the best guard-big tandem the WNBA has ever seen.  Those two were at White’s introductory presser, and spoke with ESPN’s Michael Voepel about their excitement to play for White, with Clark explaining that the detailed approach the Sun always had in facing the Fever makes her believe White can help them improve some of their weaknesses quickly.  “We know how much of a legend she is in Indiana,” Clark said Monday. “I think that’s really cool. Playing against her, I would say I felt like her teams always had the best scouts against us. I think that just speaks to her knowledge of the game and her way to analyze, and she clearly was on to something. Hopefully, in turn, now that she knows how to stop us, that should be a good way to know how to [help us] beat certain things as well.” Boston added, “There’s nothing better than playing for a coach that you can already tell she’s going to pour into us. She knows the talent that we have and I’m super-excited to get out on the court. You can feel the intensity already.” White will have the next six months to self-scout the Fever and identify the areas they can improve for 2025, as the expectations will only get bigger for Indiana. At the very least, White believes her young star duo is only scratching the surface and if Clark and Boston can level up in 2025 together, Indiana will have a chance to be a real threat to the WNBA’s top-4."

	Ja Morant hit a wild 360 layup against the Nets and decided to do it again later just for fun.","With Ja Morant missing almost all of last season due to suspension and injury (playing just 9 games), he found himself a bit outside the conversation for top point guards in the NBA coming into the 2024-25 season. It was a lost season for both Morant and the Grizzlies last year, and both player and team are looking to remind the NBA of their talents early this season.  While it’s been an up-and-down start to the year, Morant has offered reminders of his unique brilliance with highlight reel plays that only he produces right now in the NBA. On Monday night in Brooklyn he offered up a pair of outrageous finishes as he was strong on the B-button with two 360 layups against the Nets. The first came on a drive against Nic Claxton, where Morant jumped in the air and spun all the way across the lane for a silky finish with his left. The second was even more spontaneous, as Morant went up thinking about a poster dunk on Cam Johnson before changing his mind for another spinning lefty layup, changing hands in mid-air.  A post shared by NBA (@nba)   A post shared by NBA México (@nbamex)  It’s a pair of plays that perfectly encapsulate Morant’s singular ability as a high-flying guard. The first is so smooth as he just glides effortlessly through the air, while the second started with him thinking power but he had the time and ability to change his plan (and hands) mid-flight for the finish."

	The former teammates crossed paths in a pretty tense way on Monday night.","The Golden State Warriors traveled to Washington to take on the Wizards on Monday night, which meant that the Warriors crossed paths with an old friend, Jordan Poole. An important part of the team’s last title, Poole was traded to the Wizards last season in the aftermath of a tumultuous year with the Dubs. During Monday night’s game, the player responsibility for all that turmoil crossed paths with Poole once again, as the high-scoring guard had a run-in with Draymond Green. Poole knocked down a triple in the waning moments of the second quarter as Green attempted to contest his shot, and after it went in, he pointed right at Green. On the ensuing Warriors possession before the half, Steph Curry knocked down a three — Poole tried to contest it, he was unsuccessful, and Green immediately pointed right at him.   A post shared by SportsCenter (@sportscenter)  During training camp ahead of the 2022-23 season, Poole and Green were involved in an altercation during practice that ended with Green punching his then-teammate.

	Kelce said he shouldn't ""greet hate with hate"" and apologized, even though most saw his actions as extremely understandable.","Jason Kelce is more popular on a national scale now than he ever was as an All-Pro center with the Philadelphia Eagles — although, his Super Bowl parade performance cemented his status as a Philly legend. Kelce is on ESPN’s Monday Night Countdown now and has a wildly popular podcast with his brother Travis, as the brothers have seen their stardom leap from the sports world to pop culture in general, due in no small part to Travis’ relationship with Taylor Swift that has brought her legions of fans to them.  While there are the obvious benefits of that popularity in the form of massive media deals, there are also the trappings of fame that come with the territory of being immediately recognizable to most any person. On Saturday, Jason was reminded of that when he was in State College for Ohio State-Penn State and had a heckler call Travis a gay slur for dating Swift while holding his phone out recording. That jackass was seeking a reaction and got one in the form of Jason grabbing his phone and spiking it on the ground, with videos from other nearby going viral immediately.  On Monday night, Kelce addressed the incident at the top of Monday Night Countdown and issued an apology, noting that’s not how he wants to act and that he doesn’t want to “greet hate with hate.” Jason Kelce opens ""Monday Night Countdown"" with an apology. ""I chose to greet hate with hate, and I just don't think that's a productive thing."" pic.twitter.com/9rScqAKpVD — Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) November 4, 2024  The truth is, the majority of people saw him spike the phone and felt that was an extremely reasonable response, as we need to remind people that there are real consequences to saying vile things — something the internet has made far too easy to do with no repercussions. Still, Kelce felt bad enough about it to issue an apology on national television and seemed very genuinely upset by his own actions, even if the majority of people saw them as defensible."

	Stephen A. went on a lengthy rant wondering who is allowed to criticize Kevin Durant.","Kevin Durant and Stephen A. Smith aren’t exactly on the best term, as the Suns star has taken exception to some of Smith’s reporting and pontificating for years. Most recently, Durant expressed his frustration with Smith claiming he isn’t a good leader.  Smith reported this summer that the Suns wanted out of Durant amid rumors the Rockets were pursuing the star in a trade. The Sun’s then denied that publicly and as the 2024-25 season began, Durant was in a Phoenix uniform. Still, Smith continued to prod at the star, calling him out for a lack of vocal leadership and being an aloof star in the locker room. Durant responded on Twitter (as he often does) and then again this weekend when asked about the leadership talk by The Athletic’s Doug Haller.  Durant questioned why anyone listens to Stephen A., calling him “a clown” and calling into question his sources, noting he’s never in practices or the locker room. Unsurprisingly, Smith responded on Monday morning on ‘First Take’ with a lengthy diatribe where he said he wouldn’t respond with the same “kind of pettiness and childishness” and questioned who is allowed to talk about Durant, listing off all the people KD has taken issue with (watch here).  “I got bad news for Kevin Durant, if you’re expecting me to reciprocate with that kind of pettiness and childishness, it’s not gonna happen,” Smith said. “Kevin Durant is one of the greatest players to ever play this game. He’s a future Hall of Famer, he’s a two-time champion, two-time Finals MVP, and I’ve been on the record saying he’s also a good dude. So if he wants to resort to that level, even though we’re both grown men and if he had something to say he knows my number and he refrains from doing so, that’s something he has to live with.  “Having said all of that, respectfully, Kevin Durant can you stop lying, please? I’ve been an NBA reporter and I was a columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer as well. Kevin Durant has seen me in the locker room when he was at Oklahoma City. He has seen me in the locker room when he was at Golden State. He has certainly seen me at games throughout his career. But, unfortunately for him, I don’t have to be at shootaround and I don’t have to be in the postgame locker room. I happen to have a hit show that’s been No. 1 for 12 years, I have other things to do with my time. I go to games all the time. I’m not a beat writer anymore.  “The other thing I would say is this, Kevin Durant is going to have to answer this question: Who is allowed to talk about him? Charles Barkley played this game as a Hall of Famer. He got at Charles Barkley. Shannon Sharpe is a Super Bowl champion and a Hall of Famer. He got at Shannon. He got at players, the CJ McCollums of the world, the Dennis Schroders of the world, and others. He’s gotten at fans, and did it discreetly because he had accounts that didn’t reveal who he was. It’s contemporaries and colleagues, it’s former players, it’s present players, it’s the media, it’s fans, it’s whoever. Is anyone allowed to talk about Kevin Durant? Because I don’t understand it. I don’t get it.” The “he can call me” thing from Stephen A. is always funny to me, because it implies that only he is allowed to talk about people in front of a microphone and if they want to discuss him and his commentary they should do it privately. His final point is probably his strongest, as he notes that Durant has bristled at comments from fellow players, former greats, and all manner of media members and fans. It’s a fair point, and his use of burner accounts in the past has, in particular, left a reputation of Durant having thin skin. That said, at this point, KD happily replies to folks from main, and I think his directness in responding to people — whether it’s Barkley, Smith, or some random Twitter account — breaks down the wall that typically exists in the athlete-critic relationship.  Most athletes either ignore it or internalize it for motivation, but rarely do they so regularly respond and push back on it directly. Athletes love to prove doubters or haters wrong, but they typically throw everyone into one bucket and respond generally. Durant, meanwhile, takes a very different approach by responding directly and asking for critics to elaborate or explain their reasoning further. That tends to throw folks off, including Smith. There is certainly fair criticism to be made about Durant, but I also don’t think it’s unreasonable for him to push back if he doesn’t believe it."

	Barkley spun to break one tackle and then hurdled a defender while facing the other way in an insane run on Sunday.","Hurdling an opponent is one of the great risk-reward moves a ball-carrier can make, as going airborne to avoid a tackle can lead to a huge play but also can result in a player getting absolutely blasted. Some players are much better at it than others, and Saquon Barkley is among the best in all of football at leaping defenders, going all the way back to his college days at Penn State.  On Sunday, the star running back decided to innovate on his trademark move one one of the greatest 14-yard runs you’ll ever see, where he broke out a spin move into what I can only describe as a reverse hurdle, as he leaped over a defender while facing the opposite direction.  THE 180 HURDLE??? DID SAQUON JUST INVENT THIS?! 📺: #JAXvsPHI on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/tYThjnbdgG — NFL (@NFL) November 3, 2024  I really don’t know how you pull this off without injuring yourself or fumbling, but Barkley cleared the defender cleanly and landed on his feet — before taking a shot from another defender and needing to check out for a play or two. Tiki Barber in the FOX booth rightfully loses his mind over this move, and I really hope no young running backs look at this and decide they want to replicate it because it would go extremely poorly for anyone without Barkley’s insane athleticism."

	KD called out Stephen A. Smith for being ""a clown"" and isn't sure why people still listen to him.","The Phoenix Suns picked up their fourth straight win on Saturday night in Portland, improving to 5-1 on the young season to remain tied for second in the West with the Warriors, a game back of the NBA’s last remaining undefeated team, Oklahoma City.  It’s the second season for the Suns star trio being all together, and that has, historically, been when those teams take a leap if they ever do. The first year is figuring out how it all should work and learning how not to step on each other’s toes, and then the second year is when we find out if the ceiling really is as high as it appears on paper. For that reason, the strong start to this season is a very good sign for the Suns, even if there’s still a long way to go this season in confirming their status as a top threat in the West.  An additional subplot to this Suns season is that of Kevin Durant’s reputation, as the future Hall of Famer still gets nagged about whether he’s an effective leader, largely because his greatest team success came when he joined the Warriors where it was clearly Stephen Curry’s team. Charles Barkley has prodded at KD pretty consistently, calling him a follower and bus rider, while Stephen A. Smith regularly takes aim at Durant’s leadership as the thing he lacks compared to other top stars of his generation.  Durant and his Suns teammates and coaches have scoffed at that notion, and on Saturday night Durant was again asked the leadership question by Doug Haller of The Athletic and had some pointed words for Stephen A., calling him “a clown.”  “Yeah, Stephen A., I don’t understand how people even listen to Stephen A.,” he told The Athletic. “I’ve been in the league for 18 years. I’ve never seen Stephen A. at a practice, or a film session, or a shoot-around. I’ve never seen him anywhere but on TV talking s— about players. … He’s a clown to me. He’s always been a clown. You can write that, too.” Durant went on to note that he isn’t taking a different approach or trying to be more vocal this year, insisting that he’s going about his business as always. He bristled, in particular, at commentary from the likes of Smith that he is aloof and distant from his teammates, which his Suns teammates push back on as well when asked by Haller. “To say that I’m just sitting here, you paint this picture of me coming into the locker room, not talking to my teammates, quiet, not talking to my coaches,” Durant said. “Like, come on, man. It’s just ridiculous.” Durant is far from the only NBA star who gets frustrated by Smith’s commentary and, particularly, when he offers up sourced reporting despite not being on the ground covering the league on the road regularly. Smith certainly knows a ton of people in and around the league, but players and fans are constantly skeptical of what he says, largely because it often feels his opinion and any reporting get blended together all into one. That makes it tough to separate the two, especially because he can’t help but go over the top with how he presents things. Durant has voiced his annoyance with Smith in the past, but this is some of his firmest criticism that hasn’t been levied on Twitter."

	Drake also hurled insults at DeRozan during the game's broadcast.","You may have moved past Kendrick Lamar’s chart-topping Drake diss, “Not Like Like Us.” But Drake surely hasn’t. After Akademiks dispelled rumors of a reconciliation between Drake and Future, the “First Person Shooter” rapper attempted to flex his star power against another foe.  Yesterday (November 2), Drake attended the Toronto Raptors and the Sacramento Kings game at Scotiabank Arena. Instead of focusing on the friendly matchup, Drake and his longtime friend Nessel “Chubbs” Beezer decided to laser in on former Raptors star DeMar DeRozan (now the the Kings). Throughout the game, Drake could be heard hurling remarks at DeRozan (supposedly including “p*ssy” and “goof“), and it doesn’t seem to be sports related tension.  At one point, Drake and Chubbs (both courtside) can be seen standing up and staring down DeRozan (viewable here). Well, just as viewers at home caught the suspenseful moment, so did DeRozan. Over on Instagram, DeMar DeRozan decided to troll Drake back by posting a video clip from Friday (viewable here).  In the scene, starring Ice Cube (playing Craig) and Chris Tucker (playing Smokey), Tucker’s character attempts to regain tough points after being punked by the neighborhood bully, Deebo (played by the late Tommy Lister). “I got mind control over Deebo,” says Tucker. “He be like shut the f*ck up. I be quiet. But when he leaves I be talking again.” This comes after Drake vowed to “pull down” DeRozan’s number should the Raptors ever decide to retire it after Vincent Carter’s number retirement celebration. DeRozan claimed that he and Drake were “still family” even after he appeared in the “Not Like Us” music video. However, it appears Drake doesn’t feel that same."

	DeRozan, of course, was in Kendrick Lamar's ""Not Like Us"" video, which surely had nothing to do with any of this!","It was a night for celebration in Toronto, as the Raptors retired the iconic number 15 worn by Vince Carter. And to put a cherry on top of what was a joyous evening in the 6, the Raptors were able to pick up a thrilling, 131-128 win over the Sacramento Kings in overtime, thanks to a 31-point outing by RJ Barrett. Playing the Kings meant that another Toronto legend, DeMar DeRozan, was back in town. Drake, unsurprisingly, was also there, which set up a pretty funny back-and-forth. While sitting in the broadcast booth, Drake expressed that he does not want DeRozan to get a banner, saying “If you ever put a DeRozan banner up, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.” Now, it’s unclear if this is serious or a joke, but it’s worth remembering that DeRozan was in the music video for Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” and appeared on stage at The Pop Out while Lamar performed the song at the height of his feud with Drake earlier this year. And after the game, DeRozan got asked about Drake’s comments and had a simple response before getting up and walking away. “He gonna have a long way to climb to take it down,” DeRozan said. “So, tell him good luck.” It’s worth mentioning that when DeRozan was asked about the Drake-Kendrick feud, he said that “Drake’s still my man, still my man, none of it changed.” We’ll be sure to let you know if all of this tonight was in good fun or if things have changed between these two."

	The incident happened after Philly fell to the Grizzlies on Saturday night to move to 1-4 on the year, with Embiid not playing in the game.","The Philadelphia 76ers fell to 1-4 on the regular season on Saturday night, as the team picked up a 124-107 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. As has been the case every time they’ve taken the floor this year, the Sixers were without the services of Joel Embiid, who is ramping up following an issue the team discovered in his left knee. But despite not taking the floor, Embiid was involved in an incident after the game. According to Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer, Embiid “assaulted a reporter in the locker room.” There wasn’t a ton of information in the aftermath, but eventually, Shams Charania of ESPN reported that Embiid got into it with the person who wrote “a recent column that referenced his late brother,” which featured a shove but no punch. Earlier this week, Embiid spoke with the media in Philly and got uncharacteristically fired up, saying “When I see people saying he doesn’t want to play. I’ve done way too much for this city, putting myself at risk for people to be saying that. So, I do think it’s bullsh*t.” In particular, he called out “that dude, he’s not here, Marcus, whatever his name is,” a reference to Pompey’s colleague, Marcus Hayes. Presumably, the reporter Embiid got into it with is Hayes, who wrote a column in October titled “Joel Embiid disrespects the Sixers, the game, its greats, and himself. Shaquille O’Neal and Charles Barkley are right to rip him.” While the piece has since been edited to remove the references to Embiid’s son and late brother, you can read what it originally said here. UPDATE: Kyle Neubeck of PHLY Sports spoke about the altercation on the PHLY Sixers Postgame Show and explained how the altercation came about, with Embiid telling Hayes not to mention his family, before the two went back and forth for nearly two minutes with Embiid eventually shoving Hayes. Per Neubeck, Sixers security staff and players stepped in quickly."

	Jake Paul came out to to the ring to Phil Collins’ “In The Air Tonight,” riding in a customized low-rider with his brother Logan Paul. The entrance was jam-packed with thinly veiled jabs at Tyson, with the song referencing the boxer’s appearance in The Hangover, and even a bird, referencing the “Now Kith” meme. Tyson, however, walked out to the ring with pure intention of throwing down and nothing more. And all the built-up tension was released as the two combatants entered the ring for the highly-anticipated showdown. 
	While both Tyson and Paul promised to knock the other boxer out before the 5th round, the match surprisingly went for the entire eight rounds. Tyson came out swinging for the first two rounds but Father Time quickly got Iron Mike together, as the icon began to slow down with each subsequent round.

So, Paul stepping on the OG’s foot finally set him over the top, resulting in him slapping his opponent. “[Mike Tyson] hits like a bi**h! It’s personal now. He must die!” Paul dramatically screamed to the crowd while Tyson walked away from the stage.

	The slap marks a shift in Mike Tyson’s behavior towards Paul. Throughout the event’s rollout, Tyson and Paul have played it fast and loose, keeping the banter semi-playful while throwing in a couple of laughs and jabs here and there. However, as the day of the fight quickly approached, Tyson transformed into something far more intense. On Tuesday (Nov. 12), the boxing legend talked to reporters about the fight, promising to unleash “the devil himself” on Friday night. 
	“I’m bringing the devil himself [to the ring],” Tyson told ESPN. “There are no feelings attached. My own mother should be very careful if she has to get in the ring with me. When it’s over, it’s over. But while the process is going on, my intention is to hurt him. I hope he has the same intentions, or he is in trouble.” 
	Mike Tyson’s first fight in almost two decades will go down on Friday (Nov. 15) at 8 PM EST live on Netflix.

Sports,"Carmelo Anthony, Rudy Gay Chime In On Drake-DeMar DeRozan Feud",https://www.vibe.com/news/sports/carmelo-anthony-rudy-gay-drake-demar-derozan-feud-1234943651/,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:22:01 +0000",The biggest topic of the year and all of its subsidiaries continues to make headlines.,"The intersection of Hip-Hop and sports means twice as many people chiming in on topics involving artists and athletes. Former NBA stars Carmelo Anthony and Rudy Gay recently chimed in on the recent back and forth between Drake and DeMar DeRozan, which was a byproduct of the 6 God’s feud with Kendrick Lamar earlier this year. 
	“I think Drake was hurt a little bit because of the relationship he built with DeMar in Toronto,” Melo said on an episode of his show 7PM In Brooklyn. “Representing the 6, Raptors — you know that was a lot of connection with those two. He’s a Raptor for life from a basketball standpoint. Yes, that jersey should be going up.” 

	








 
	Gay, who just recently retired from the NBA, previously played for the Raptors, and is a new recurring co-host on 7PM, disapproved of Drizzy’s behavior. “That’s wack, man. Drake is wack for that,” he asserted. “You gotta pull up on DeMar if you feel that way before you go on camera.” Melo agreed, especially regarding the Toronto rapper’s comments on taking down DeRozan’s banner if the Raptors ever hung one up for him.

	“Drake did a lot when he said I’ma go up there and take it down. That part is a lot,” Carmelo Anthony said. However, he acknowledged that DeRozan turned himself into Drake’s opposition when he joined Kendrick Lamar on stage at The Pop Out concert and appeared in the “Not Like Us” music video. “Those are shots. You my man, we in the crib, we hanging, we building the 6 up. From that standpoint, that would f**k me up, too. I’m gonna feel a way no matter what, but yes, you do have a conversation. As a man, you have a conversation.” 
	Though Rudy Gay did not like the “First Person Shooter” rapper’s actions, he leveled with Anthony on that part. “If you got a problem, come at me,” he said. “To see your man’s out there dancing with the enemy, that’s kinda crazy.” 
	Drake and DeMar DeRozan went viral earlier this month when the For All The Dogs rapper sat courtside for the Toronto Raptors matchup against the Sacramento Kings. At one point, he was interviewed on air and said, “Unfortunately, we’re playing this goof [DeRozan] tonight, but it is what it is” as well as “If you ever put up a DeRozan banner, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.”

	








 
	After the Raptors defeated the Kings, Drake could be seen mouthing “F**k outta here pu**y” as DeRozan walked off the court. During a post-game press conference, the six-time All-Star was asked about the comments regarding the banner and said, “Well he gon’ have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck.” 
	This is a significant change in their relationship, just three years after DeRozan said that Drake would “forever have a friend” in him. When he was traded from the Raptors to the Spurs, despite being told he would not be traded, the five-time Grammy winner invited him to his house and gave him support in his time of disappointment. Even after appearing at The Pop Out and in the “Not Like Us” music video, he claimed that he still had love for the OVO head honcho. Those days are seemingly over.

	Lil Wayne’s history of sports talk goes back even further than that. He used to contribute blog posts to ESPN The Magazine and joined Around The Horn as a guest in 2009. He even found creative ways to bring together football and music, like his 2011 track “Green & Yellow” which was an homage to the Green Bay Packers. In 2016, he created “No Mercy” which was Shannon Sharpe and Skip Bayless’ theme song on Undisputed.

Sports,Bronny James To Play For Lakers’ G League South Bay Team,https://www.vibe.com/news/sports/bronny-james-lakers-g-league-south-bay-team-1234942101/,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 16:19:23 +0000",Bronny will make his South Bay debut in their game against Salt Lake City.,"Bronny James will now play for the Los Angeles Lakers‘ G League affiliate, South Bay.  
ESPN reports that the rookie NBA player will make his debut with the minor league squad in a Saturday exhibition against Salt Lake City. However, Bronny will be on the Lakers roster for their game on Friday, squaring off against the underperforming Philadelphia 76ers. 
	Sources close to the Lakers state that Bronny will only play for South Bay during their home games. James will then “shuttle” between both teams during an undisclosed period of time. While it may come as a shock to some fans, Lakers head coach JJ Redick explained that this was the plan they had for Bronny “since day one.” 
	Bronny James’ situation isn’t unique to him, either. As he was selected to the Lakers with the 55th pick of the 2024 NBA Draft, it was expected that he would get some burn in the G League. Historically speaking, players selected late in the second tend to spend time in the minor league to get additional coaching, structure in their respective team’s culture, and gain game reps.

	








 A post shared by South Bay Lakers (@southbaylakers) 
	Bronny James has only played in four games this season for the Los Angeles Lakers out of the eight games so far. The Lakers are currently 10th in the Western Conference with their 4-4 record.

	After the game, both father and son spoke about the moment and how much it meant to them to share a piece of history. “That moment, us being at the scorer’s table together and checking in together, something I will never forget,” LeBron told ESPN during a post-game presser. “No matter how old I get, no matter how my memory may fade as I get older or whatever, I will never forget that moment.” 
	“I tried not to focus on everything that was going on around me and tried to focus on going in as a rookie and not trying to mess up,” Bronny said. “But yeah, I totally did feel the energy, and I appreciate the Laker Nation for showing the support for me and my dad.” A post shared by Los Angeles Lakers (@lakers) Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"

	In a recent interview with Loaded magazine, the former heavyweight boxing champion opened up about his bouts with addiction and how the experience has shaped his personal outlook. 
	“I still have struggles with my mental well being but thankfully I have better tools,” the Brooklyn native told the outlet. “I’ve learned a lot over the years from being a former drug addict. I understand my triggers and why I self sabotage.”

	








 
	Tyson continued, adding that introspection and self-reflection have aided him in his growth and arc of redemption. “When I’m honest with myself and do that self inventory I feel great,” he expressed.

	“I think many people want to blame others for their problems without realising they are a part of their own story and they can redirect their life at any time. But that’s only possible if you’re honest with yourself about how you got to where you are now.” 
	Elsewhere in the interview, Tyson opened up about his usage of testosterone, attacking the stigma placed around the hormone and those who take it for health and wellness. 
	“I think there is this misconception that if men take testosterone it’s because physically there is something wrong with them,” the 58-year-old said, adding that an insufficient level of the hormone has been shown to alter one’s mind-state and emotions. 
	“But from the age of 30, I don’t care how healthy you are, your testosterone levels drop. This affects more than just your physicality, it also affects your mood,” he reasoned. “Getting a testosterone plan as you age should be as normal for a man as taking a daily supplement in my opinion, because it does so much to stabilize the body and mind.” 
	Mike Tyson is currently preparing for his highly-anticipated boxing match against YouTuber Jake Paul, which is finally set to take place following numerous delays and false starts.

The Philadelphia 76ers star got into a physical altercation with a reporter who wrote a slanderous article about him and, as a result, will serve a three-game suspension.  
	“Mutual respect is paramount to the relationship between players and media in the NBA,” Joe Dumars, NBA executive vice president of basketball operations, said in a statement. “While we understand Joel was offended by the personal nature of the original version of the reporter’s column, interactions must remain professional on both sides and can never turn physical.”

	








 
	The former MVP reacted to an article where Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes called Embiid’s commitment to the game into question and referenced his son and late brother. “The next time you bring up my dead brother and my son again, you are going to see what I’m going to do to you,” he told Hayes during their brush-up. “I’m going to have to … live with the consequences.” No punches were thrown, but the 30-year-old hooper did shove Hayes.

	Joel Embiid’s suspension will force him to miss Wednesday night’s game against the Los Angeles Clippers (Nov. 6), Friday’s game against the Los Angeles Lakers (Nov. 8) and Sunday’s matchup with the Charlotte Hornets (Nov. 10). The seven-time All-Star has yet to play this season due to injury, and will make his 2024-2025 regular season debut on Tuesday (Nov. 12) against the New York Knicks. 
	The Philadelphia 76ers currently sit at 1-5 due to Paul George also missing games over an injury. They will look to right the ship and try to overcome their consistent playoff disappointments at full power, but health is a regular concern for both Embiid and George. 
	A week before the regular season began, the Cameroonian center told ESPN that he would probably never play back-to-back games again. The Sixers are typically a high-seeded team in the Eastern Conference but often fail due to Embiid either being unavailable or playing when he isn’t 100% healthy.

Dot, but the 6 God doesn't approve.","Drake infamously referred to his beef with Kendrick Lamar, other rappers, and celebrities as a “20 v 1,” and it may be more than 20 when adding up everyone who’s done things that can be perceived as against him. Take DeMar DeRozan for example, whom he went back-and-forth with at the recent Toronto Raptors and Sacramento Kings game. 
	The 38-year-old rapper was courtside at Scotiabank Arena on Saturday evening (Nov. 2,) as he often is, but it was a special occasion this time; Vince Carter became the first former Raptors player to have his number retired by the franchise. Despite the emotional celebration, the Raptors’ Global Ambassador still had some petty energy to put into the air.

	








 
	Footage showed him and longtime friend Chubbs standing up and glaring at DeRozan, a former Raptors player, when he was on the court. At one point, in true Drizzy fashion, he got on the commentary microphone and spoke with the game’s announcers. “If you ever put up a DeRozan banner, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself,” he said during an interview. At another point in the evening, when discussing the significance of VC’s jersey retirement, the 6 God said “Unfortunately, we’re playing this goof [DeRozan] tonight, but it is what it is.”

	DeMar DeRozan had a chance to be the hero and send the game into overtime with a game-tying three-pointer, but he missed the shot. As the Sacramento Kings and Toronto Raptors players exited the court, Drake could be seen mouthing “F**k outta here, pussy.” 
	In the post-game press conference, reporters asked the six-time All-Star for his thoughts on the Toronto rapper saying he would pull his banner down if the Raptors ever gave him one. “Well he gon’ have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck,” DeRozan said before exiting the podium. 
	Later that evening on his Instagram story, the Compton-born hooper responded to the situation with a clip from Ice Cube and Chris Tucker’s 1995 movie Friday. “Man sit yo a** down,” Cube’s character Craig told Tucker’s character Smokey as the antagonist, Deebo, left their presence. “Man, I got mind control over Deebo,” Smokey said in response. “He be like ‘Shut the f**k up.’ I be quiet. But when he leave, I be talkin’ again.” The clip was especially fitting as Friday is set in South Central Los Angeles, near Compton, where DeRozan and Kendrick Lamar are from.

	








 DeMar's IG story. Cooked that fraud @Drake pic.twitter.com/Zf9F4yABsW 
	This begs the question: Why is Drake angry at DeMar DeRozan, one of the best players ever to don the Toronto Raptors’ jersey, who spent nine seasons with the team and was on record being his good friend? It all goes back to his feud with Kendrick Lamar a few months ago. In June, when K. Dot held his concert The Pop Out in Los Angeles, DeRozan was captured on stage dancing to “Not Like Us.” He doubled down in July when he appeared in the music video for the track. 
	The 35-year-old hooper had been asked about his relationship with the For All The Dogs rapper following the two appearances and assured people that he still had love for him. “Love Drake, always can play him,” he told FOX40 when asked if he could still play Drake’s music following his feud with the Pulitzer Prize winner. “[But] Kendrick been a friend of mine—Damn near family, we both from the same city. Grew up damn near in the same neighborhood, but it’s always been there, it hasn’t been always publicized, but that’s basically family.”  
	Kendrick Lamar made this clear on “Not Like Us,” when he rapped “I’m glad DeRoz’ came home, y’all didn’t deserve him neither,” referring to DeRozan joining the Sacramento Kings this past summer after stints with the Raptors, San Antonio Spurs, and Chicago Bulls. Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan on stage for “Not Like Us” with Kendrick Lamar pic.twitter.com/c6SnHxDP0T 
	In another interview, DeRozan doubled down and stated that they are still friends, but he did what he did for the culture. “Drake’s still my man, still my man, none of it changed,” he told The Sacramento Bee. “It’s so easy to get overlooked and look at it for what it looks like, but at the end of the day it’s music, entertainment. Two of the biggest rappers in the world went at it from a competitive standpoint and they battled it out.” 
	As for being at The Pop Out and in the “Not Like Us” music video, Derozan said: “It was fun to be a part of. For that moment, it was so much bigger than what people look at it as a beef between (Lamar) and Drake. It brought our whole city together in a different type of light where there wasn’t no issues, no violence. Everybody was coming together in a peaceful manner and that was the beauty out of those moments.”

	








 
	Given the fact DeRozan was one of the people Drake unfollowed on Instagram over these last few months, it is safe to believe that Drake felt betrayed; especially by someone whom he comforted in a difficult time. DeRozan spoke with Shannon Sharpe on a 2021 episode of Club Shay Shay about being traded from the Toronto Raptors to the San Antonio Spurs in 2018.  
	DeMar DeRozan was devastated, especially after being told he would not be traded, and the five-time Grammy winner welcomed him into his home to talk for hours. “When it come to him, he’ll forever have a friend in me and loyalty out of me because he cared,” DeRozan told Shannon Sharpe. “He was there for me when everything was just going crazy.”   Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"

	Following the news, Reese took to X to joke that she can now “afford her bills.” The quip comes after she revealed that her WNBA salary doesn’t cover her $8,000 rent and barely covers her car note. 
	Reese reportedly made $73,439 in her rookie season as the No. 7 overall pick of the 2024 WNBA draft.

(courtesy of San Jose State athletics) Then, Batie-Smoose, Slusser and other current and former players on the team and across the Mountain West filed a lawsuit against the conference and San Jose State that provided further context on the allegations.  San Jose State volleyball player Chandler Manusky is quoted in the lawsuit recounting an incident in early October, when she and other teammates, including the trans athlete, violated team rules by sneaking out of the team hotel the night before a match against Colorado State. Manusky claimed to have then learned about an alleged plan by player Blaire Fleming to ensure San Jose State would lose the match and set up Colorado State player Malaya Jones to spike Slusser in the face during a match on Oct. 3.  ""Manusky said that at Jones’ residence Fleming had shared with Jones the scouting for the CSU-FC game and they had discussed Fleming ‘throw[ing] the game’ and how they would set up Jones to ‘blow up’ Slusser and ‘blast’ her in the face during the game,"" the court documents read.  ""Manusky also said that Fleming stated, ‘I’m going to leave center court open,’ which would allow Malaya Jones to have a wide-open shot to try to ‘blow up Slusser,’ i.e., to try to hit Brooke Slusser in the face with the ball."" The documents allege Manusky confronted head coach Todd Kress and currently-suspended assistant coach Melissa Batie-Smoose about the incident. Manusky claims she was crying as she begged them not to tell Fleming that she had come forward with the story. Kress is alleged to have told Batie-Smoose that he believed the story was not true. ""Kress told Batie-Smoose he did not believe Manusky and thought she had made up the entire story so she would not get in trouble for leaving the team hotel,"" the documents read.  Slusser previously told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that she was made aware of Fleming's alleged plan and believes she has been treated unfairly by the university, arguing the university has not done enough to investigate the matter.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Colorado State University police behind the San Jose State University Spartans bench monitor Moby Arena during an NCAA Mountain West women’s volleyball game between the Spartans and the Colorado State Rams in Fort Collins, Colo., on Thursday, Oct. 03, 2024. (Santiago Mejia/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images) ""If this was me, and I was the one threatening to do this to my teammate who's caused so much commotion, there would have been action taken immediately,"" Slusser said. ""I was definitely very angry, and I was glad at first to know that it was already made aware to the coaching staff and compliance and everyone, but I don't know if that made me feel any differently, I was just angry because I didn't think someone would go to these lengths.""  ""Threatening to want to hurt one of your own teammates, I just feel like there's so many things in that whole conversation that would make a school want to get it dealt with.""  In the first game since the lawsuit was filed, San Jose State beat Colorado State in the rematch of the game on Saturday. Fleming had the game-winning serve and was swarmed by the other Spartan players in celebration, including Slusser and Manusky.  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Trump appeared on Rogan's popular podcast on Oct. 25, engaging in a freewheeling discussion that lasted some three hours. Harris declined to do the show, and Rogan would later endorse Trump. Anticipation built all week that Trump would appear at the fight, and rumors were confirmed by Margo Martin, Trump’s deputy director of communications, who shot video of the president-elect entering his jet to travel to New York.  A photo from inside the jet showed Trump watching the preliminary fights alongside RFK Jr., who he named earlier this week as his pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy, who began the 2024 campaign as a Democratic candidate, suspended his bid and joined forces with Trump in August, becoming a powerful surrogate and a close confidante in the final months of the race. Ramaswamy, an early 2024 Republican presidential candidate who dropped out of the race and threw his support behind Trump, tweeted a picture of him with Kid Rock at the Madison Square Garden fight. It was not clear if they flew with Trump or traveled separately.  Ramaswamy and Musk have been appointed to run what Team Trump is calling the Department of Government Efficiency, which intends to root out trillions of dollars in waste and fraud in the federal budget. Trump and White are longtime friends, the latter making several appearances during Trump’s campaign leading up to the election. DONALD TRUMP HEADS TO UFC 309, EXPECTED TO RECEIVE RAUCOUS CHEERS AFTER ELECTION WIN White, who said Trump is a ""big fan"" of mixed martial arts, was coy about rumors Trump was heading to the Garden during an interview with TMZ Sports.  ""I think that anything is possible,"" White said with a smile. ""Who knows? He could pop in."" White added that a majority of his organization’s fan base has shown love to Trump over the years.  Former President Trump talks with UFC President Dana White during a fight between César Almeida (red gloves) and Roman Kopylov (blue gloves) during UFC 302 at Prudential Center in Newark, N.J., June 1, 2024.

""If he comes [Saturday] night, it will definitely be fun."" Trump showed up at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, for UFC 302 in June, where a thunderous applause rained down from the crowd as well. Former Bellator lightweight champion Michael Chandler, who is back in the octagon after more than two years since his last fight, is a noted Trump supporter and hoped he would be in attendance.  ""I did see Trump, and he said, ""I’ll either be there on Nov. 16 because we won the election, or, if I lost, I’ll be depressed, and I won’t show up.’ Obviously, he won the election, so it sounds like he’s going to be there,"" Chandler said.  Chandler added that winning his fight in front of Trump would be an ""honor.""

The rally drew a packed house, and thousands more supporters milled about on the streets outside the legendary arena. White also spoke at the MSG rally, warning voters Harris is ""status quo"" for an America he believed was in desperate need of change.  ""She can get your party’s nomination without even facing voters,"" White said. ""What else? What else can she offer the American people other than vague promises and no plan? ""She talks a lot about the need for change and her hope for the future. Hope and change. Does that sound familiar? She can use the old Obama playbook, but she’s not Obama, and she is no agent of change. She is the sitting vice president of the United States right now.

Bela Karolyi, best known for training legends Nadia Comaneci and Mary Lou Retton, died at 82. No cause of death was given.

Karolyi briefly became the national team coordinator for the USA Gymnastics women’s elite program in 1999 and incorporated a semi-centralized system that eventually turned the Americans into the sport’s gold standard.

FLASHBACK: US OLYMPIC GYMNASTS SLAM NASSAR INVESTIGATION, ALLEGE FBI 'TURNED A BLIND EYE,' FALSIFIED REPORT During the height of the Larry Nassar scandal in the late 2010s, over a dozen former gymnasts came forward saying the Karolyis were part of a system that created a culture that allowed Nassar’s behavior to run unchecked for years.  Nassar, USA Gymnastics' disgraced team doctor, was effectively sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting gymnasts and other athletes with his hands under the guise of medical treatment. The Justice Department agreed in April to pay $138.7 million to settle 139 claims by those who accused the FBI of mishandling sexual assault allegations against Nasar in 2015 and 2016. Nassar worked at Michigan State University and was the team doctor at USA Gymnastics in Indianapolis.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Draymond Green is used to getting whistled for flagrant fouls.  On Friday, the 13-year NBA veteran found himself back at the center of controversy. In the third quarter of the Golden State Warriors' game against the visiting Memphis Grizzlies, referees called a foul against Green after Zach Edey fell hard to the floor with just over seven minutes remaining. Moments before Edey fell to the hardwood, Green lost his balance and the ball as he was driving to the basket. Green landed on the court near Edey's feet. The Grizzlies center then picked up the ball and tossed an outlet pass to start a fast break.  Before Green got back on his feet, his elbow got tangled with Edey's foot, and Edey tripped over Green's outstretched leg.

Green was initially charged with only a personal foul. ""Draymond grabs his leg and pulls him down, and it doesn’t get reviewed,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said after the game. ""I know there’s a code in this league, and I don’t understand how that wasn’t reviewed. Very disappointing.""

Seth Moulton spoke out against it.,"Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., ripped the Democratic Party as ""very arrogant"" following its stunning electoral defeat at the hands of President-elect Donald Trump last week. HBO late-night host Bill Maher has been one of the harshest internal critics of the Democratic party since Vice President Harris' landslide election loss to Donald Trump. In his latest episode, Maher took aim at those in his party who are still looking to defend trans inclusion in women's sports.  ""Stop screaming at people to get with the program and instead make a program worth getting with,"" Maher lectured. ""What good is liberalism if you don't win elections?""  Maher brought up a recent situation in Massachusetts, where Rep. Seth Moulton has received fierce backlash by those in his own party for speaking out against the left's stance on trans athletes in a New York Times article.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Salem, MA - November 8: Protesters in front of Seth Moulton’s office.  (Matthew J. Lee/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) ""I have two little girls. I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that,"" Moulton said in the piece.  After the comments were made, Moulton's campaign manager and director of his ""Serve America"" political committee Matt Chilliak reportedly stepped down from his position, according to The Boston Globe.  Maher believes that Moulton would be right to let Chilliak leave amid some Democrats' thinking on trans inclusion.  ""Congressman Moulton sounds reasonable to me, but his campaign manager resigned in protest, let me make this as plain as I can to the smart people, the campaign manager that resigned, yeah, let that person go. Marginalize that guy,"" Maher said.  Maher even advocated that it's time ""to make too woke be a cancelable offense.""  Moulton is not alone as a Democrat in wanting to pull back on support for transgender rights, and specifically trans athlete inclusion. His stance marks a growing divide within the party that Maher has now acknowledged, as the issue became one of the party's biggest and most surprising vulnerabilities in its recent election failure.  Trump and other Republicans hammered Harris and Democrat opponents on the issue in the weeks leading up to the election. In response, the Democrats had no clear consensus on a response. Multiple Democrats who signed bills in support of trans inclusion in the past had to publicly pull back on their support ahead of the election. These include Texas Rep. Colin Allred, Texas Rep. Vicente Gonzalez and Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola.  TRANS VOLLEYBALL PLAYER ACCUSED OF PLAN TO HARM TEAMMATE AFTER TAKING SCHOLARSHIPS FROM FEMALE PLAYERS Meanwhile, Ohio Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown was forced to defend himself when being linked to the issue by claiming he was never in favor of allowing biological males in women's sports. Still, many on the left have been vocal about defending trans inclusion. This includes one of Maher's HBO colleagues. ""Last Week Tonight"" host John Oliver recently delivered a passionate tirade against those who have spoken out against trans inclusion in one of his episodes. Oliver criticized the Harris campaign for not being more vocal in defense of trans inclusion, and spouted unsubstantiated claims that biological male trans athletes are not at an advantage to biological females.  ""The Harris campaign failed to formulate a response, especially when it's pretty easy to do,"" Oliver said. ""There are vanishingly few trans girls competing in high schools anywhere, even if there were more, trans kids like all kids vary in terms of athletic ability, and there is no evidence they pose any threat to safety or fairness.""  The Biden-Harris administration issued a sweeping rule in April that clarified that Title IX’s ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions."" And while the administration insisted the regulation does not address athletic eligibility, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that it would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.  Bills like the Equality Act and a Transgender Bill of Rights have been proposed and co-sponsored by Democrats, which would help enable transgender inclusion in women's sports at a national level.  Meanwhile, President-elect Trump has suggested a federal ban of transgender inclusion in women's and girls sports.  In June, a survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago asked respondents to weigh in on whether transgender athletes of both sexes should be permitted to participate in sports leagues that correspond to their preferred gender identity instead of their biological sex.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Students hold flags as they protest against Katy ISD's new transgender policy outside the school district's educational support complex on Wednesday, Aug. 30, 2023 in Katy, Texas. (Brett Coomer/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) Sixty-five percent answered that it should either be never or rarely allowed. When those polled were asked specifically about adult transgender female athletes competing on women’s sports teams, 69% opposed it. The United Nations released study findings that say nearly 900 biological females have been denied medals in sports because they were beaten out by transgender athletes. The study, titled ""Violence against women and girls in sports,"" said that more than 600 athletes did not medal in more than 400 competitions in 29 different sports, totaling over 890 medals, according to information obtained up to March 30. ""The replacement of the female sports category with a mixed-sex category has resulted in an increasing number of female athletes losing opportunities, including medals, when competing against males,"" the report said.   Jackson Thompson is a sports writer for Fox News Digital.

The temporary moniker is an homage to the team’s parent club, which plays 69 miles to the south in New York City, as well as to the agriculture found in upstate New York. New York is the second-largest producer of apples in the US, averaging 29.5 million bushels annually. The logo features an anthropomorphic apple named Empire, “a nod to New York’s status as the Empire State and to the popular apple variety developed at Cornell University in the 1940s,” per the team. Empire is carrying a Statue of Liberty torch and waving a number one foam finger, set against a navy and yellow color palette meant to emulate the New York state flag. The Big Apples will play July 26, August 15, and September 4. The on-field debut of the brand will coincide with the 237th anniversary of the day New York ratified the U.S. Constitution and officially became a state."
SportsLogos.Net News,Cleveland Guardians Announce New Uniforms for 2025 Season,https://news.sportslogos.net/2024/11/15/cleveland-guardians-announce-changes-to-uniforms-for-2025-season/baseball/,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 19:22:52 +0000",The Cleveland Guardians announced today they&#8217;re making changes to all four of their standard uniforms for the 2025 Major League Baseball season. It&#8217;s the first tweak the club has made to their set since they rebranded as the Guardians three years ago. We&#8217;ll start with the home and road set,"The Cleveland Guardians announced today they’re making changes to all four of their standard uniforms for the 2025 Major League Baseball season. It’s the first tweak the club has made to their set since they rebranded as the Guardians three years ago. We’ll start with the home and road set before moving onto the bigger changes announced today, to their two alternate jerseys. At home the Guardians will continue to wear the same scripted red wordmark across their chest as they have since 2022, but it’s now presented straight across the jersey rather than diagonally. New red/blue/red piping has been added to this jersey as well, around the collar and around each sleeve, replacing last year’s single blue stripe. The biggest change to the Guardians home uniform is the new cap they’ll wear with it, which will now be predominantly red instead of blue. The logo on the front of the cap remains their “Diamond-C” logo, but now in blue with white trim. For road games, the only change we’ll see to the Guardians grey jersey is the addition of that same piping we see on the home whites — red/blue/red around the collar and each arm. The “CLEVELAND” wordmark across the chest remains the same. The cap paired with the road grey jersey is now the blue crown with red visor the team wore for home games from 2022-24. The all-blue cap, which had been worn exclusively on the road last year, is history. The Guardians red home jersey will see a totally new wordmark across the chest, as they’ll now use their “Bridge Print” font to display GUARDIANS in blue with white trim. Previously, this jersey used the same scripted-style lettering we see on the home whites. The new piping is present on the red jerseys as well, but now in a blue/white/blue pattern. Photos show the Guardians wearing their blue cap with a red visor alongside this jersey, just as they did last year. The biggest overall change comes to the road blue set, where the arched “CLEVELAND” wordmark has been scrapped in favour of their Diamond C cap logo in red with white trim. The club says this is an homage to the team’s uniforms worn between 1901 and 1945 which also featured a large “C” on the front. Piping is present on this set as well, in a red/white/red pattern around the collar and sleeves. No changes here! In 2025, the Guardians will continue to wear their Guardians of Traffic-inspired navy blue City Connect uniform exactly as it was in 2024. My thoughts? While I like its design, the red cap paired their home white jersey will take some getting used to; they did try this once before, very briefly in 2018, before going back to their usual navy blue lids. I wouldn’t be surprised to see them switch to the blue caps at home at some point in 2025 and instead wear the red caps with the red jerseys. The addition of the piping is nice, but where it looks especially sharp is on the club’s new blue road alternate tops. That classic bright red/white/red immediately gives me flashbacks to uniform styles of the 1970s and 1980s (think of the Big Red Machine). The big bold red “C” on the dark navy blue jersey is also a strong look with nice ties back to the team’s uniform roots. None of the new jerseys are available to purchase yet, the team says they’ll be available at some point before the start of the 2025 season."
SportsLogos.Net News,Puma Unveils New Home and Away Kits for Five African National Teams,https://news.sportslogos.net/2024/11/15/puma-unveils-new-home-and-away-kits-for-five-african-national-teams/soccer/,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 17:53:35 +0000","Countries on the continent outfitted by Puma include Côte d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Morocco and Senegal","With qualification matches underway for the next African Cup of Nations, Puma has unveiled new national team home and away kits for countries they outfit on the continent. Puma officially launched the five sets of jerseys on Friday, November 15, saying in a press release that they “have each been constructed with identity and culture at the forefront, with intricate designs representing different takes on the country’s art, history and pride – reimagined for the Beautiful Game.” “We are incredibly proud to unveil these kits, ones that will be worn by some of the best nations, players and fans on the continent,” said Marco Mueller, Puma’s senior head of product line management teamsport apparel. “Africa is part of the Puma DNA and we are proud to work together with our fantastic nations. This comes at an exciting time for African football, ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations for both men’s and women’s teams in 2025, and we’re excited to see what those next iconic moments in our kits will look like.” Here’s a closer look at all five jerseys and what Puma had to say about each design: The new Côte d’Ivoire kits are inspired by the annual festival ‘La Fête des Masques’ the festival at the heart of Ivorian folklore. The iconic orange Home jersey has been intricately detailed with a fringe effect that is applied to traditional costumes and reminiscent of festival goers, whilst the Away jersey design symbolizes the dances performed at the festival and features a white base with green detailing to allow the elephant to take center stage. Both kits capture the vibrancy and ceremonial essence of Ivorian culture. Egypt has been crowned champions of Africa on seven occasions, so it’s only fitting their new kits acknowledge the Kings and Queens the country is synonymous with. Pharaoh, sphinx, sand dune and pyramid themed designs adorn both kits, with the bold red Home jersey featuring a repeat stylised illustration of Pharaohs, pyramids and sand dunes in an all over print, whilst the white Away jersey features an attention-grabbing Pharaoh design as the centrepiece amongst a pattern of pyramids. Four-time Africa Cup of Nation winners Ghana are iconic in every sense, both in name and nature. Traditional Adinkra symbols form a unique all-over pattern on the Home kit, with a central black star completing the statement, meanwhile the Away kit shines brightly in yellow, similarly incorporating the star and symbols as a nod to Ghana’s rich cultural heritage. Ghanaian native, Jefferson Osei set out to unite Ghanaian tribes through his kit design. Working with renowned Ghanaian painter Daniel Alum Jasper, who painted the graphic element of selected Adinkra symbols by Jefferson resonating with all the different tribes within Ghana, he created a custom print for the new Home kit. Upon initial glance, the white jersey appears to feature a simple star print; but as players begin to perspire, the symbols become more pronounced. The yellow Away kit pays homage to Ghana’s ‘Gold Coast’ and represents the colors often found in Ghanaian culture and has the adinkra symbols on the sleeves of the jersey. Morocco is set for big expectations both on and off the pitch in 2025 as hosts of the men’s and women’s Africa Cup of Nations and having the talent to go far in both tournaments, so ensuring they will be represented with kits that fans feel a connection to is imperative. Having made history as the first African team to reach the semi-final of a World Cup, the kits are a nod to their national history. Abderrahmane Trabsini, born and raised in Amsterdam, was inspired by the beauty of Moroccan and Berber craftsmanship in creating the Moroccan kits. Encapsulating the essence of Moroccan artistry, the Home kit features patterns inspired by traditional Moroccan zellige tiles, with intricate geometric designs symbolizing unity, eternity, and artisanship. Trabsini also incorporated Berber symbols often seen in Moroccan rugs into the Away kit, with motifs representing protection, fertility, and harmony. These elements connect deeply with Moroccan heritage, adding cultural depth to the design. The vibrant red and green palette reflects the national flag, while the inclusion of the indigenous language honors Morocco’s rich history. The new Senegal Home jersey encompasses the theme of ‘Teranga’ – the spirit of hospitality. The kit’s design draws inspiration from the nation’s workers, reflecting a fearless and progressive identity expressed through modern art and culture. This results in a clean strip with accents in the colors of the national flag. The Away kit however takes a bolder approach, with a green and lime palette that incorporates a lion print across the chest, inspired by the country’s art and design."

After teasing the jerseys on National Teddy Bear Day all the way back in September, the P-Bruins finally unveiled them on their social media channels on Wednesday, November 13. They’ll make their on-ice debut during the team’s Retro Weekend, with home games on November 30 against the Utica Comets and December 1 versus the Springfield Falcons. ⏪ Rewinding to Retro ⏪ Get your first look at our all-new alternate sweaters, set to debut on #AHLBruins Retro Weekend (Nov 30/Dec 1) ⤵️🟡 Replicates styling of late 90s/early 00s jerseys🟡 Reversed coloring: Gold 🔄 Black🟡 Reversed logos: Front Crest 🔄 Shoulder Patch pic.twitter.com/j8QRaXOGQJ The new jerseys put a new spin on the 90s/2000s look by flipping black and gold, making gold the predominant color with black stripes outlined in white all the way down the sleeves. It also flips the logos, moving the “pooh bear” logo from the shoulders to the front of the jersey, swapping places with the spoked-P. White and black stripes run around the waist. Inside each black arm stripe are gold numbers with white outlines, along with truncated white and gold stripes. None of the materials that accompanied Wednesday’s announcement showed the names and numbers on the back of the jersey, but it’s safe to assume both will be mainly black. The logo of sponsor Amica Insurance sits on the right chest. Players modeling the new alternate jersey in photos also wore black helmets, gloves and pants. Socks were not visible in any of the promotional materials. Like their NHL parent club in Boston, the P-Bruins wore gold socks with the 90s/2000s black jerseys these new alternates are based on. Gold socks are a distinct possibility, but if the “color flip” theme continues, then they could also be black. The P-Bruins’ Retro Weekend game against Utica will music, graphics and games from the 1990s, while the game against Springfield will focus on the 2000s. Puck drop on Saturday is at 7:05 p.m. ET, while Sunday’s game is at 3:05 p.m. ET."

The club unveiled the logo on their website and social media channels on Friday, November 15, and then celebrated with supporters at an event at a park in Burleigh Heads, a suburb of the city of Gold Coast, Queensland. They also kicked off a new marketing campaign branding themselves as “Fearless” as they head into their 14th AFL season. Fearless. pic.twitter.com/XMrWpMPwXn The centerpiece of the Suns’ new brand is the new primary logo. It’s comprised of three key elements, according to the club: There are also subtle G and C characters hidden in the design, “a nod to our history and original logo. Together, these elements capture who we are, where we’ve come from, and what we strive for on and off the field.” “We knew after 14 years with the same brand that it was time to update our look and feel to better represent how we have evolved and matured as a football club,” said Suns CEO Mark Evans. “Our new logo is modern, bold and innovative, with layers of context which speak to our history and purpose. We’re excited to show the world our new brand, and tomorrow we will reveal our new guernsey and colour palette, marking the start of our new era.” Along with the logo, the Suns unveiled their new guernseys, made by New Balance, for the 2024-25 AFL season. They’re mostly red, with a tonal version of the primary logo on the chest. Curving tonal pinstripes adorn the sides of the guernsey and extend onto the shorts, where a pale gold version of the logo is placed on the left leg. Numbers on the back of the guernseys are the same shade of pale gold. The Suns joined the AFL in 2011, and this is the first time they’ve done a major overhaul on their visual identity. Their previous logo was a red oval with a yellow outline, the letters “GC” inside in yellow and a blue shadow. “SUNS” was written out in red underneath, arching to match the curve of the ball. An alternate version featured sun rays emanating from the center of the football. The Suns are the second of three AFL teams who were reported to be unveiling new logos this offseason to do so. The Adelaide Crows unveiled a new logo but no guernseys earlier this month. The third reportedly changing up their logo is St. Kilda Football Club, based in Melbourne. The Suns open their 2025 AFL Premiership season at home against the Essendon Bombers on Saturday, March 8."

On Thursday, November 14, the NLL unveiled 13 new community identities for its UnBOXed program, which aims to introduce young boys and girls to the game of lacrosse in their gym classes. These are not expansion teams, but the NLL hopes these identities and community-relevant names will help engage people in these markets and encourage them to participate in the UnBOXed program. They also hope they “illustrate the League’s commitment to growing box lacrosse across Canada and the United States” as they work toward their goal of becoming the “next major league.” “NLL UnBOXed illustrates our bold approach and dedicated commitment to growing the game of lacrosse and welcoming new NLL fans to our uniquely entertaining sport. As we invite and welcome more communities, schools, families, and fans to the NLL, while strengthening our connections in these key areas throughout North America, we move one step closer to our goal of becoming ‘The Next Major League.’” The NLL hopes to expand its activation footprint to 60 communities across North America by the time the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles roll around. Those games will include sixes lacrosse — a format similar to the box lacrosse played in the NLL — as a medal sport for the first time since 1908. The NLL is also part of the Elevate 28 initiative, which aims to increase the number of people participating in lacrosse in the U.S. to 4 million by 2030. The 13 new UnBOXed identities, combined with the 14 current NLL franchises, bring the league’s total activation footprint to 36 markets throughout North America. Here’s a closer look at the new identities, with all graphics courtesy of the NLL’s Facebook page: The initial nine UnBOXed identities were launched in November 2023. Since then, though, the St. Louis entry changed its name from the Rhythm to the Howlers, and with the Ottawa Black Bears joining the NLL, the Ottawa Electrics became the Dallas Oilcats, an identity that uses elements of the now-defunct Panther City Lacrosse Club logo. The 2024-25 NLL regular season gets underway on Friday, November 29, with two games. A new Battle of Ontario will spark up with the Ottawa Black Bears playing host to the Toronto Rock, while the Vancouver Warriors visit the Colorado Mammoth later that evening."

The Nittany Lions launched the uniforms on their website and social media channels on Wednesday, November 13, and will wear them on the ice for the first time against Big Ten rivals Wisconsin on Friday, November 15. The jerseys borrow heavily from the Nittany Lions’ look in the 1940s, when Penn State’s hockey program was first founded. The white base has navy blue shoulders and a navy blue “PS” monogram on the front. Navy barberpole-style stripes adorn the sleeves and the socks. The navy blue numbers on the sleeves and back “mimics the number font used on the Generations of Greatness football jerseys,” while the contrasting nameplate on the back is navy blue with white lettering. The retro look is rounded out by brown pants and gloves. The pants also feature an interlocking “PSU” logo used in the 1970s that has a puck between the P and the S. The helmets are navy blue, with a raised white “Penn State” logo on the sides and white player numbers on the front. For captains, the C appears in a navy blue keystone on the right chest. “Penn State’s ice hockey tradition began well before we ever had a Division I program and we owe a debt of gratitude to those previous eras for establishing the foundation of Hockey Valley,” Nittany Lions head coach Guy Gadowsky said on the team’s website. “These throwback uniforms represent the different periods that helped build our program into what it is today and it’s our way of giving those teams a stick tap to the shins to express our appreciation to everyone that laid the foundation for the modern era of Penn State Hockey.” Old Time Hockey! 😤#HockeyValley pic.twitter.com/chvGMCj1wN Penn State played its first varsity hockey game on December 6, 1940, against Carnegie Tech. The program continued for four seasons until it was cut — along with cross country, swimming, gymnastics, tennis and golf — as part of cost-cutting measures during the Second World War. It returned for one season in 1946, but limited facilities meant it was once again dropped. In 1971, 3,000 people signed a petition to bring hockey back to Penn State. The team — dubbed the Icers — played 41 seasons and won seven national championships before the Division I era began in 2012. As a pure “start-up” team, it seemed too gaudy for them to display the name Penn State on the first jerseys. Thus, a custom logo was designed as a unique moniker for the front of the jersey. A creative, stylized amalgamation of letters and hockey imagery, the logo features the initials of Penn State University with two hockey sticks surrounding a puck in the negative space between the letters. The artist responsible for the design, a Penn State student, has remained anonymous despite multiple efforts. Following Friday’s game against Wisconsin — the first of a six-game homestand for Penn State — these alternate uniforms will enter their jersey lineup “as a true alternate to be worn multiple times throughout the next few seasons.”"

Valencia players will wear their black away kits at home on Saturday, November 23, when they host Real Betis. The all-black uniform is meant as “a sign of respect for those who died due to the DANA catastrophe and in solidarity with all those affected.” More than 200 people in the Valencia region died in late October when a destructive weather system known locally as DANA — the Spanish acronym for high-altitude isolated depression — moved through the area, causing torrential rainfall and massive flooding. Valencia’s usual front-of-shirt sponsor has given up their space for the November 23 game, and their logo will be replaced by the motto “AMUNT VALENCIANS” (“Come on, Valencians”). Printed on the back, below the player number, will be another motto: “UNITS CON SEMPRE” (“United as Always”). The black away kit, made by Puma, features an embossed pattern that reimagines the city of Valencia’s flag and its “distinctive blue band filigree as a subtle background pattern on a sleek black shirt with elegant gold accents.” Game-worn jerseys will be auctioned off online afterwards through MatchWornShirt. Proceeds from the auction will go to “help resume sporting and educational activities for children affected by the DANA crisis.” The game against Real Betis will be Valencia CF’s first match since the DANA tragedy. An away match against RCD Espanyol scheduled for Sunday, November 9, was postponed. Puma and Valencia CF have also teamed up to offer a solidarity T-shirt for sale, with proceeds again going toward sports and educational activities for children affected by the storm. It features the “UNITS CON SEMPRE” motto on the front and a list of cities and towns affected by flooding on the back. The shirt is available through Valencia’s online store and through Puma.com."

That was also the first season that USC sported the trojan head logo on the sides of its cardinal helmets, as well as a modified Northwestern striping pattern on the sleeves of its cardinal home and white road jerseys. This design was worn until the 2002 season, when then-head coach Pete Carroll reintroduced the crescent-shaped shoulder design the Trojans initially wore from 1958-71 and still wear to this day. USC will wear metallic helmets with chrome face masks as a modern update to the classic look for Homecoming. #FightOn pic.twitter.com/5zP4pF6sBR This will mark the first time that USC has deviated from its standard home or road uniforms since the Trojans wore a metallic version of their cardinal helmets with chrome facemasks for select games during the 2014-15 seasons. They also added gold flakes to their standard gray facemasks in 2012, but – aside from that small detail – they have consistently worn Saturday’s throwback uniform or their current design for more than 65 years. The Trojans wore these uniforms, which are complete with their standard gold pants with two cardinal stripes down the sides, under legendary coach John Robinson (1976-82, 1993-97), who passed away on Monday at the age of 89.

Though they were unveiled and worn in a match in late October, Genoa continued to build up hype around their new black jerseys for the 2024-25 season this week. First, they posted a teaser video featuring the signature bells from the start of the WWE Hall of Famer’s entrance music, which they followed up with photos of the four-time WWE Champion wearing the kit, manufactured by Kappa. ⏳⚫️🍯 pic.twitter.com/go87j1WHkq The black base of the kit features a repeating pattern of tonal griffins isolated from the club crest. That crest appears on the left chest in black and gold, while gold Kappa logo sit on the right chest and each shoulder. The collar and sleeve cuffs are solid black with gold trim. The version worn by the Deadman — whose real name is Mark Calloway — features gold sponsor logos on the chest, left sleeve and lower back, along with a Serie A patch on the right sleeve. Genoa gave fans a look at the third jersey in a video posted to social media two days before Halloween, when the club wore the kits in a 1-0 loss to ACF Fiorentina. 🌑 The Ǥøłđɇn̷ Dark side of Genoa ✨✍️ Noi non siamo come nessun altro.

As part of the series, the Nets will take on the alternate identity of “Les Nets” during their six Quebec-based games. The team’s temporary red-and-blue logo features two fleur-de-lis on a blue circle, a nod to the Quebec flag. A large red circle within the blue includes Montreal’s Mount Royal cross, stylized to represent a basketball while incorporating the city name. The incorporation of red isn’t because the Long Island Nets typically use red (I mean, of course, it is); it’s a tribute to Montreal’s McGill University, where James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, taught in the 1880s. “Montreal has a vibrant basketball legacy, and this partnership presents a unique opportunity to blend our culture with the Laval community,” said Morgan Taylor, Head of Business Operations for the Long Island Nets, in the press release. “We look forward to engaging with a new fanbase and creating memorable moments both on and off the court.” The arrangement brings up memories of the unique situation Minor League Baseball’s Buffalo Bisons found themselves in during the 2021 season. With their MLB affiliate from Toronto residing in their home stadium due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Bisons shifted their home games to Trenton, NJ. They played with a split identity, using their usual Bisons name and uniforms on the road but taking on that of the Trenton Thunder at home.

FC Barcelona announced the new “multi-year partnership agreement” on their website on Saturday, November 9. The club said the deal “brings a new collaborative strategic partnership model between the two organizations.” This new partnership consolidates Nike as a Main Partner of the Club and Official Technical Partner across all professional and amateur teams, bringing a unique model that strengthens the brands association and fuels the global retail and licensing business growth. Nike has a key strategic role in the Club’s Retail Operations and together with Barça Licensing & Merchandising will join forces in the development of specific plans related to product creation, supply chain and global distribution.   Nike has outfitted Barça since 1998. Since then, Barça’s men’s first team has won four Champions League titles, 12 La Liga titles, seven Copas del Rey, three World Club Cups and three European Super Cups wearing Nike uniforms, while the women’s first team has won nine league titles, three UEFA Women’s Champions League titles and nine Copas de la Reina in that time. The terms of the deal between Barça and Nike were not disclosed in Saturday’s announcement, but ESPN reports “the deal will total significantly more than €100 million ($107m) per year, but that the agreement is incremental and that the total amount is also dependent on certain add-ons.” They also report that Barça president Joan Laporte has previously claimed it would be the biggest deal of its kind in world soccer. According to Mundo Deportivo, Barça will receive €1.7 billion over 14 years, or about €121 million per year. It also includes a signing bonus of €158 million, which will also be spread over the 14 years of the contract. Mundo Deportivo also reports that Barça was allowed to field offers from other companies, and they did receive a proposal from German sportswear brand Puma, which Nike then matched. The previous contract between Nike and Barça was set to expire in 2024. There was some friction between the two sides earlier this year, with Footy Headlines reporting in July that a Spanish court had blocked Barça’s attempted to end their contract early. They also reported that retailers were having a hard time ordering Barcelona products from Nike, and Barça’s 2024-25 third kit celebrating women’s sport was released about three weeks later than similar third kits for other high-profile clubs outfitted by Nike."

This offseason, Boston is primed to make major changes to their roster with the hopes of becoming postseason and World Series contenders in the near future. Last week, the Red Sox had their first meeting with superstar free agent Juan Soto and his representation, and manager Alex Cora was reportedly in attendance. Cora recently spoke on the state of his team and their plans this offseason. “I think the talk (internally) has been more about the big league club instead of player development, and that’s a positive for the fan base,” Cora said (via MassLive). “We have a plan in place. We know there’s certain aspects of the roster that we have to improve. I think we’re going to be very aggressive on that. “We talked about if after the season on the stage (at the end-of-year press conference), where we’re at right now as an organization. We’re in a good place... We made some strides. That’s the bottom line. There were some individual players, if you go by pieces of the puzzle, there were some good stories. Guys got better. Guys can still get better. And there’s a plan in place. “I truly believe what we talked about — I can’t talk for Scott (Boras) and what the industry’s saying — but what we said the last time we were together at Fenway. We were very honest and I think we’re going to execute.” Boston's fans are restless after three seasons of failing to make the postseason, so making moves will certainly get the fan base excited again and give the team better opportunities to hoist a trophy.

Entering the Week 11 game against the Baltimore Ravens, Boswell had made 23-of-24 field goals on the season, all 20 of his extra points. When the Steelers were struggling to score touchdowns earlier in the season, it was Boswell who always delivered to put points on the board. The Steelers haven't had too many struggles finishing drives since Russell Wilson took over in Week 7, but Pittsburgh had no shortage of issues in that department against the Ravens on Sunday. Thankfully, Boswell was in cooking in Week 11. The Steelers called on Boswell to kick a whopping six field goals in the crucial game versus the Ravens, and the veteran kicker answered the bell each time. Boswell made one kick in the first, two in the second, a pair in the third and one more in the fourth. That last field goal in the fourth proved to be massive, as the Ravens scored a late touchdown to cut the deficit to 18-16, but failed on the two-point conversion, which ultimately helped Pittsburgh seal the win. Following his latest outstanding performance, Boswell has scored 107 points on the season, which is just 22 less than the rest of the team COMBINED. If you take out Justin Fields' stats, he has more than the rest of the team. Update: Boswell 107, all others aside from backup QB 96, Justin Fields 30 https://t.co/ACIx7LdYaJ Of course, Boswell's 18 points were more than the Ravens' offense could score as a whole on Sunday. There are no words for how valuable the 33-year-old has been this season. You can certainly make the argument that he's the Steelers' Most Valuable Player through 10 games.

Is Sunday the day the streak comes to an end? Kansas City's road battle with the Bills certainly looks like the toughest matchup on the team's remaining schedule, though two more division leaders are still to come in the Steelers and Texans. Buffalo has won each of its past three regular season games against the Chiefs, all of which were played at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. Sunday's game comes in a much tougher environment for the Chiefs, as a raucous Highmark Stadium crowd will be looking to set the tone ahead of the playoffs and get inside Patrick Mahomes' head. Fortunately for both offenses, it will be a balmy day by Buffalo standards with a forecasted temperature of 56 degrees. Will Swift be among the Chiefs faithful in a sea of Bills fans on Sunday? Here's what you need to know about her whereabouts for the AFC showdown.  NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule There has been no update about Swift's attendance for the Chiefs-Bills game in Week 11 with with the game set to kick off.  While it wasn't known whether Swift will be cheering on Travis Kelce at Highmark Stadium, her schedule lined up just about perfectly for her to attend the game. Swift played an Eras Tour show in nearby Toronto on Saturday night, and she doesn't pick up the tour again until Wednesday back in Toronto. With Buffalo just a short flight over Lake Ontario away from Toronto (or drive, but you know the drill).  What are the odds that such a critical matchup between the Chiefs and Bills in Buffalo lined up so well with Swift's schedule? The NFL claims they are just as surprised as everyone else, apparently. The scheduling was ""completely unintentional,"" CBS Sports reported. Regardless of how it happened, the schedule is set up well for Swift to return to Highmark Stadium after she was in attendance for the Chiefs' playoff win over the Bills in January. This section will be updated if Swift is spotted at Sunday's game in Buffalo. Swift played her final U.S. show in Indianapolis on Nov. 3, and Sunday's game will be right in the middle of her second-to-last stop of the entire tour: Toronto.  Given the city's proximity to Buffalo, she should be in the building for Sunday's game.

Here is why the NBA says officials made an incorrect non-call.,"Gilbert McGregor Jayson Tatum made the second buzzer-beating, game-winner of his career Saturday, draining a side-step 3-pointer to give Boston a three-point overtime win over Toronto. Impressive as the shot was, it has not come without controversy. In the immediate aftermath of Tatum's clutch jumper, basketball fans on X (formerly Twitter) quickly pointed out that he shuffled his feet before putting the ball on the floor. The discussion has now shifted to whether or not Tatum should have been whistled for an infraction before his heroics. Did Tatum travel against the Raptors? Here is a closer look at the play and how fans across social media have reacted to a slow-motion breakdown. SN's NBA HQ: Live NBA scores | Updated NBA standings | Full NBA schedule With under 10 seconds remaining in overtime, the Celtics and Raptors were tied at 123. Tatum received the ball near the right wing and after a series of jab steps, used three dribbles to create space from Toronto forward Ochai Agbaji. Tatum rose for a 3-pointer with under one second remaining. The ball left his hands before time expired, giving Boston its 11th win of the season while Toronto fell to 2-12. JT JUST CALLED GAME 😮‍💨🚨#TissotBuzzerBeater #YourTimeDefinesYourGreatness pic.twitter.com/0j5IPloASF Tatum finished one assist shy of a triple-double with 24 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. It was a big win for the Celtics, though the Raptors were on the second end of a back-to-back and were without several key players, namely Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickley. Tatum should have been called for a travel before his game-winner vs. Toronto, the NBA announced Sunday. On the Last Two Minute Report for Saturday's game, the NBA says officials made an incorrect non-call as Tatum ""slides his pivot foot before releasing his dribble."" After Tatum's game-winner, BBALLBREAKDOWN on X posted that Tatum ""got away with some fancy footwork"" before his game-winner. A slow-motion look at the play appears to show Tatum shuffling his feet on the jab series, which by rule would be a travel. If I were a Raptors fan, I'd be pretty pissed right now as Tatum got away with some fancy footwork on his game winner 🤦‍♀️ pic.twitter.com/HVEdGlX8G3 Celtics fans argued the potential non-call on Tatum is offset by a non-call on Jaylen Brown. No foul was called when Brown was dislodged by Raptors guard Davion Mitchell during the play. The Last Two Minute Report also acknowledges that Mitchell should have been whistled for a foul and that officials were incorrect in the non-call. The Raptors did not have a foul to give and Brown would have been awarded free throws. Yahoo Sports NBA writer Vincent Goodwill posted that there was ""a whole lotta steps there,"" jokingly calling Tatum's move ""A whole Cupid shuffle."" NBA agent and entrepreneur Nate Jones called it a ""Bunny hop in the pea patch."" Because Saturday's game came down to the final play, the NBA will provide a definitive answer on Tatum's footwork with its Last Two Minute report. Within the report, the league will share whether or not the game's officials made the correct or incorrect non-call.

After a title run with hardly any starting pitching to speak of, reinforcements are on the way. Shohei Ohtani, Tyler Glasnow, and Tony Gonsolin should all be ready to go by Opening Day, and Clayton Kershaw seems destined to return to L.A. for one more year. Add all that to the fact that the Dodgers are tied to every big-name free agent on the market (i.e. Roki Sasaki, Corbin Burnes, Max Fried, etc.), and it seems unlikely that one hometown kid will be back in Dodger Blue in 2025. Jack Flaherty, the Harvard-Westlake graduate who came to his hometown team at the trade deadline, was vital in keeping the Dodgers afloat amid all sorts of starting pitching injuries. But it doesn't seem all that likely that L.A. will make an earnest effort to bring him back. Recently, Zach Pressnell of Newsweek predicted that Flaherty would instead sign with the Philadelphia Phillies, one of the Dodgers' primary threats for a second-straight National League pennant. ""Looking at free agency, there are multiple ace-caliber pitchers like Corbin Burnes and Blake Snell. But on the tier below that, you will find Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Jack Flaherty,"" Pressnell said. ""Flaherty was a key piece to the Dodgers World Series championship in 2024 and Spotrac only projects him to sign a three-year, $60 million contract. Flaherty would be much more affordable than the other top pitchers on the market which could fit what the Phillies are doing perfectly."" The Phillies have an opening in their rotation thanks to the brutal struggles of Taijuan Walker, and Flaherty may be just what they need to get back on track. The 29-year-old righty tossed 162 innings with a 3.17 ERA last season, racking up 194 strikeouts. Of course, there's a simple way for the Dodgers to keep Flaherty away from the Phillies: pay him market value to stay in town. But they may have their sights set on reeling in a bigger fish.

The second-year quarterback turned in the best performance of his young career in a 28-27 upset victory on the road against the New York Jets. After being benched by head coach Shane Steichen due to a lack of attention to detail in his game-planning throughout the week, Richardson showed just what he can bring as the future of the franchise. The 22-year-old quarterback completed 20-of-30 passes (66.7%) for 272 yards, one touchdown, no interceptions and a 106.5 passer rating. He also added 10 rushing attempts for 32 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns, including the go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter. Richardson was hot to begin the game, showing much more poise in the pocket and avoiding the temptation of playing hero ball. Richardson led the offense to scoring drives on three of their first four drives to begin the game. While the offense stalled out during the third quarter, he led two impressive touchdown drives during the fourth quarter. Richardson led those two fourth-quarter drives consisting of eight and six plays, respectively, of 70 yards each. Despite dealing with a battered offensive line that included two rookie starters along with an injured and inefficient Jonathan Taylor, Richardson put the team on his back in an impressive win. This was exactly the type of performance the Colts needed to see from their young quarterback, and it makes the outlook of his career trajectory much more promising. It won't all be perfect for Richardson moving forward, but if he can play under control like he did Sunday, the Colts certainly have a chance to sneak into the playoffs as a wild-card team.

New England's defense was horrendous in this contest. They allowed Matthew Stafford to complete 66.7% of his passes for 295 yards and four touchdowns. They also surrendered 107 yards on 5.4 yards per attempt to the duo of Kyren Williams and Blake Corum. The Patriots' game plan didn't make much sense, as they had Christian Gonzalez lined up on the boundary against DeMarcus Robinson for most of the game. That allowed Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp to make play after play all afternoon. Alex Van Pelt's offense was up-and-down. Drake Maye completed 75% of his passes for 282 yards, two touchdowns and an interception that ended a late comeback attempt in the fourth quarter. He had six targets catch at least four passes, including Kendrick Bourne, Hunter Henry, DeMario Douglas, Austin Hooper, Kayshon Boutte and Rhamondre Stevenson. Maye's two touchdowns went to Bourne and offensive tackle Vederian Lowe on a trick play. The rookie quarterback also lost the ball on a strip-sack after his left guard (Michael Jordan) and center (Ben Brown) were unable to pick up a twist. New England's trio of running backs (Stevenson, Antonio Gibson and JaMycal Hasty) rushed for 93 yards on just 3.6 yards per attempt. Maye rushed for 27 yards on three carries and cornerback Marcus Jones rushed once for five yards.

Here are our best player prop and anytime TD scorer bets, including Ja'Marr Chase and Ladd McConkey.","Week 11 SNF bets are coming to you live from Los Angeles, where Joe Burrow and the Bengals (4-6)  meet Justin Herbert and the Chargers (6-3). It’s getting late early for Cincinnati’s playoff hopes, and they’ll need to go on quite a run to land an AFC Wild Card berth. The Bengals trail the Steelers (7-2) by a month’s worth of losses and stand very little chance of winning the AFC North. The Chargers trail the Kansas City Chiefs (9-0) by three games in the AFC West because it’s hard to keep up with teams that don’t lose. However, their wild card odds are extremely favorable compared to Cincinnati’s. On odds boards at NFL betting sites, Los Angeles is favored by -1.5 and the over/under sits around 47.5. Beyond the spread and totals, there are some exciting SNF prop bets and anytime TD scorer bets for Bengals and Chargers:  The lingering uncertainty around WR2 Tee Higgins' hamstring injury continues to make Mike Gesicki TD scorer wagers tantalizing. Ja’Marr Chase will continue breaking big plays and looking like the NFL's fastest and most dangerous WR in the open field. Higgins' absence has changed the target share significantly. With Higgins sidelined, Gesicki has feasted on 23 targets in the past three weeks. Even if Higgins returns on SNF, he may be on a snap count. Gesicki seems likely to continue getting lots of targets, and Joe Burrow is absolutely slinging it this season.  

  Rookie WR Ladd McConkey has quickly earned the trust of QB Justin Herbert and the Chargers coaching staff. Averaging 13.3 YPC and scoring 4 TDs this season (including a highlight-reel worthy 60 yarder), the Georgia product has helped pace a Chargers passing game that doesn’t have Keenan Allen for the first time since 2012. He leads the Chargers with 492 receiving yards. The Bengals pass defense has been an issue this season, ranking 23rd in yards surrendered per game. They’ll be tested deep by Quentin Johnston and McConkey. 

 Also check: Top sports betting sites | Best sportsbook promos   Ever since the Bengals drafted Chase out of LSU he’s been elite. Chase has scoring jaunts of 70,70, and 63 yards and a whopping 10 TDs total this season. Chase is only 19 yards short of cresting the 1,000-yard mark, and his 14.9 YPC clip speaks to how hard he is to stop when he gets the ball in space. Fresh off a 264-yard receiving game vs. Baltimore, you don’t have to be a riverboat gambler to imagine Chase making some big plays on SNF. The Chargers defense has surrendered only 12 TDs this season, but its hands will be full with Chase and Burrow. 

  The Bengals' season would look a lot different if their defense wasn't ranked 23rd, and they'd had a different fate in even just a few of the one-score games they've lost. However, Bill Parcells is right: You are what your record says you are. The Cincinnati D's inability to keep WRs and TEs covered is a good reason to consider making this Chargers prop bet. While nobody is going to confuse Dissly for Antonio Gates, nobody is going to confuse the Bengals defense with one that does well against the pass, either. Dissly netted five catches for 30 yards on six targets last week, and even though his 8.2 YPC doesn’t mean he's a big-chunk play kind of guy, he may be worth targeting for Week 11 SNF props.

The 32-year-old notched a sack on Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Mac Jones in the Week 11 game on Sunday. The play came in the fourth quarter after the game was well in hand, with the Lions leading 49-6. Jones dropped back to pass and Smith, who was actually lined up inside, broke through Jacksonville's offensive line to get the sack. With that sack, Smith now has six on the season, which surpasses the 5.5 he totaled all of last last season. Making the sack even better, Smith's celebration was excellent. Debuting in style @zadariussmith#JAXvsDET | 📺 CBS pic.twitter.com/aHpOtFzOn6 The Lions acquired Smith just ahead of the trade deadline after losing both Aidan Hutchinson and Marcus Davenport to season-ending injuries. He's under contract for 2025, also, so he won't be a short-term rental, assuming everything goes well. The veteran didn't make his debut last week, with head coach Dan Campbell wanting to give him the week off because he didn't get a bye week with the Cleveland Browns, who traded him during theirs. ""Man, very excited,"" Smith said of his impending Lions debut. ""I was just talking to coach, I can't wait. I hate that he gave me this week off. Obviously, I didn't want it.

Here's a review of both teams' ahead of today's critical game. - TE Noah Fant - CB Nehemiah Pritchett - WR Dareke Young - OLB Trevis Gipson - G Sataoa Laumea - DT Myles Adams The biggest name here for the Seahawks is obviously Fant, who's dealing with a groin injury after being limited for much of the early part of the season with a toe issue. For the year he has totaled just 27 catches, 285 yards and zero touchdowns. - TE George Kittle - CB Charvarious Ward - QB Josh Dobbs - WR Ronnie Bell - OL Ben Bartch - DL Kevin Givens - DL Khalil Davis The Niners are also missing their top tight end, but losing Kittle is a far bigger blow to San Francisco than losing Fant is for Seattle. Kittle has been killing the Seahawks, totaling seven touchdown catches over their last five meetings. Ward being out is a significant development, as well.

Pitino denied that he disliked the chants during the postgame press conference per The New York Post’s Zach Braziller. “Rick Pitino said he was not upset with the ‘Who's your daddy’ chants,” Braziller tweeted. Pitino not disowning the chants is an objectively funnier narrative than him not liking a rabid Manhattan crowd cheering him on in a friendly and light-hearted way. It’s quite the juxtaposition with the prevailing storyline in the days following a St. John’s win over Wagner: his Red Storm players’ parents being too “over the top.” “For years, coaches had been making millions and players had gotten nothing. Now, they’re being paid a great deal of money,” Pitino said on the November 14 episode of WFAN’s “Boomer and Gio” (h/t The New York Post). “What I will say what I like about it, I’d say my players give about 80 percent of the NIL to their parents to help them out and their families. That’s a great thing. “The parents are great parents. They’re very interested, they’re just a little over the top. One of my players on the team hasn’t been rebounding well, and his parents said ‘You gotta get your numbers [up]. You gotta get those rebounds up.’ These kids have enough pressure with social media. They don’t need that. It is a little over the top. They are wonderful parents, they’re loving parents, they’re great, but they’re just a little too involved. I wish they would just be less involved in their lives in terms of when it comes to performance. Leave that up to the coaches.” Ultimately, Pitino sounds like a happy father following St. John’s fourth win of the 2024-25 season in the ""Pitino Bowl."" “It was a great win with a great crowd and a great day,” Pitino said to reporters. St. John’s faces Baylor, Georgia, Harvard, and Kansas State next in a true prove-it stretch for the Red Storm.

Porter Jr. suffered the injury in the third quarter of the contest versus the Ravens, and it appears to be a lower leg injury. The former first-round pick was shaken up after it appeared he took an inadvertent shot to his leg from a Ravens defender. Porter Jr. was down on the field for a bit before he was helped up and walked off under his own power. He was able to job a bit while leaving the field, so that's a positive sign. Here's the latest injury update. UPDATE: Porter Jr. has exited the game again with an injury after briefly leaving earlier in the game with a leg issue.

That’s a given. He’s won a World Series, was a runner-up MVP multiple times, and was an All-Star and Silver Slugger multiple times.

Sporting News RSS,Justin Tucker missed field goals: Why some fans believe Travis Kelce is to blame for Ravens' star's struggles,https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/justin-tucker-missed-field-goals-travis-kelce-ravens/6e86d4371cb7b532f5d7a428,"Sun, 17 Nov 2024 20:18:59 +0000","Ravens kicker Justin Tucker does not look like the same player he once was, and some believe an interaction with Travis Kelce might be the reason.","Dan Treacy The Ravens are successful year-in and year-out partly because they tend to be one of the most fundamentally sound teams in the NFL. Sure, having a Hall of Fame-caliber quarterback helps. For the last decade, though, defense and kicking have been constants in Baltimore. That's not quite the case this year. The defense has started to slip for the Ravens this season after losing three key defensive coaches from John Harbaugh's staff, but the kicking woes have been even more jarring. Justin Tucker suddenly looks nothing like the Justin Tucker of old, and two missed field goals against the Steelers halted Baltimore's momentum in the first half in Week 11. Father Time might just be winning again, but is it possible Travis Kelce actually has something to do with Tucker's struggles? Here's a look at Tucker's stats from 2024 and why some fans believe an interaction with Kelce might have thrown him off his game. NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule Tucker is 15-of-21 (71.4 percent) on field goal attempts this season after his two misses on Sunday, which came from 47 and 50 yards out, respectively. Ian Eagle's *first* announcer's jinx on Ravens kick Justin Tucker pic.twitter.com/MXT8qNRDqs A 71-percent field goal rate would be concerning for any kicker, but it's downright stunning for Tucker. The soon-to-be 35-year-old entered 2024 as the NFL's all-time leader in field goal percentage at 90.2 percent, but that mark is now down to 89.3 percent amid the uncharacteristic year. One more missed field goal would tie Tucker's career-worst mark, set in 2015, and there are signs these issues aren't just a fluke. The veteran started to show some cracks in the foundation last season when he made only 1-of-5 attempts from at least 50 yards out, down from a 15-for-20 rate between 2021 and 2022. Tucker is 2-of-6 from at least 50 yards after Sunday's miss from 50, and he's already done something he didn't do in 2023 by missing two field goals from between 40-49 yards out.  Tucker is in his mid-30s, but kickers tend to have longer careers than most other position groups. Did something else throw him off his game? Fans have a theory. MORE: How the Steelers contain Lamar Jackson so well Many have asked how the Chiefs keep winning close games. Is there some kind of voodoo magic working in the favor? Well, if there is, it's gotten the best of Tucker. Chiefs TE Travis Kelce made headlines before last season's AFC championship when he tossed Tucker's helmet, footballs, and kicking tee away during warmups to make room for himself and his teammates. Travis Kelce told Justin Tucker he needed to move because their QB Patrick Mahomes had to warm up. So Kelce kicked his ball away and threw his helmet. 😂 pic.twitter.com/pFF0DC1yA7 Tucker smiled rather than engage with Kelce, but nothing has been the same ever since. Justin Tucker being broken by Travis Kelce throwing his stupid kicking tee is one of my favorite NFL stories ever. Tucker did make his only field goal attempt in an otherwise disappointing AFC championship game for the Ravens, so that might pour some cold water on the idea he was shaken up by Kelce. Since that point, though, his struggles are undeniable. A kicker largely seen as invincible for more than a decade now looks like a liability from long range, and whether age is the only explanation remains to be seen.  Dan Treacy is a content producer for Sporting News, joining in 2022 after graduating from Boston University.

While Ball has one of the league's most authentic personalities and is often an incredible quote, his lack of a filter sometimes gets him in trouble. After Charlotte earned an impressive win over Milwaukee on Saturday, Ball used homophobic language when describing the Hornets' defensive game plan on superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo during the game's final play. The league did not take kindly to Ball's choice of words and the 23-year-old was handed a $100,000 fine for his comments. Here is why the NBA league offices fined Ball for his postgame interview. SN's NBA HQ: Live NBA scores | Updated NBA standings | Full NBA schedule Ball was fined $100,000 for ""making an offensive and derogatory comment in a postgame interview,"" the league announced Sunday. During Ball's postgame interview, FanDuel Sports Network's Shannon Spake asked the guard about Charlotte's defense on Antetokounmpo to close the game. Ball's use of homophobic language came as he explained the Hornets' decision to force Antetokounmpo into a jump shot. ""On that last play, when he took the shot?"" Ball said. ""We loaded up — no homo — but that's what we wanted, put a hand up and lived with the result."" There is a precedent for the NBA assessing fines for the use of the same phrase. Nikola Jokic was fined $25,000 in 2018, Cam Thomas was fined $40,000 in 2023 and Roy Hibbert was fined $75,000 in 2013.

The announcement comes as Ajax prepares to celebrate its 125th anniversary on March 18th, 2025. Speaking [&#8230;]","Amsterdam, Netherlands – In a move that is sure to delight their passionate fanbase, Dutch giants Ajax have announced that their iconic classic logo will make a triumphant return as the club’s official emblem starting from the 2025/2026 season. The announcement comes as Ajax prepares to celebrate its 125th anniversary on March 18th, 2025. Speaking on the decision, CEO Menno Geelen emphasized the importance of honoring the club’s rich history and DNA. “Ajax will celebrate its 125th anniversary on March 18. The celebrations will include the announcement of the return of the classic logo. We know that the majority of our fans have cherished this wish for years, and we felt that our 125th anniversary was the perfect moment to give back the classic logo to our fans and ourselves.” Geelen went on to highlight the club’s commitment to upholding its core values and football philosophy, stating that “history has shown that we are at our best when we remain true to the Ajax DNA.” The reintroduction of the classic logo, he said, “symbolizes this commitment and serves as both a tribute to our rich history and an inspiration for the future.” The classic Ajax logo, with its distinctive red-and-white striped shield and iconic “Ajax” lettering, has long been a beloved symbol of the club. It was first introduced in 1928 and remained the club’s primary emblem until 1991, when it was replaced by a more modern design. Now, after 34 years, the classic logo will make its return, gradually being implemented across all of the club’s expressions and appearing on the match shirts once again. “The 125th anniversary feels like a very fitting moment to give the logo back to the club, the fans, and ourselves,” said Ernst Boekhorst, Chairman of the Board of Directors. “We are delighted to make such a contribution.” The return of the classic logo will be celebrated today in a sold-out Johan Cruijff ArenA, where the Ajax Legends will face the Real Madrid Legends. This symbolic event underscores the significance of the occasion for the club and its supporters. The decision to revert to the classic logo is a testament to Ajax’s deep-rooted commitment to its heritage and the unwavering loyalty of its fanbase. As the club prepares to embark on its next chapter, the return of this iconic emblem serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring spirit and tradition that have defined Ajax for over a century."

With both teams locked on four points in Group 1 of League A, the outcome of this final group stage fixture will be crucial in determining which nation avoids demotion to League B. [&#8230;]","The battle for UEFA Nations League survival takes center stage on Monday as Poland host Scotland at the Stadion Narodowy in Warsaw. With both teams locked on four points in Group 1 of League A, the outcome of this final group stage fixture will be crucial in determining which nation avoids demotion to League B. Poland have struggled to find consistency in this season’s Nations League campaign, picking up just one win, one draw and three losses so far. Despite holding group leaders Portugal to a 0-0 draw last month, the Bialo-czerwoni were ultimately overpowered 5-1 in the reverse fixture on Friday, with Cristiano Ronaldo netting a brace. Veteran striker Krzysztof Piatek has been the team’s main goal threat, but the absence of talisman Robert Lewandowski has been keenly felt. Scotland, on the other hand, come into this clash buoyed by a crucial 1-0 victory over Croatia in their previous outing. Returning hero John McGinn scored the winner to keep Steve Clarke’s side’s slim quarter-final hopes alive. The Scots have been inconsistent, with two losses, a draw and a win in their last four Nations League matches. Poland have managed just one win in their last six competitive fixtures, a 3-2 triumph over Croatia in September. Their recent form has been particularly poor, with three losses in their last four matches across all competitions. Scotland ended a 10-game winless run in all competitions with their victory over Croatia. Prior to that, they had suffered three consecutive defeats in the Nations League, including a 2-1 loss to the Poles in the reverse fixture. In the previous meeting between these sides in September, Poland emerged 3-2 victors thanks to goals from Robert Lewandowski and Sebastian Szymanski. Overall, the head-to-head record is even, with the teams mostly ending their matches with stalemates. Although historically Scotland has beaten Poland only once while the later have two wins. At least two goals have been scored in their matches played. Poland will be without Arkadiusz Milik and their captain and all-time top scorer Robert Lewandowski, who is sidelined with a back injury. Scotland are expected to field a similar lineup to the one that defeated Croatia, with teenage winger Ben Doak likely to feature prominently. Veteran goalkeeper Craig Gordon and midfielder John McGinn, who scored the winner last time out, should retain their places. This match promises to be a closely contested affair, with both teams desperate to avoid relegation from League A. Poland’s defensive vulnerabilities could be exposed by Scotland’s attacking threat, but the hosts’ home advantage and the potential absence of Lewandowski may prove decisive. – Poland to win: The home side are the favorites to secure the three points and avoid relegation.
– Over 2.5 goals: With both teams needing to go all-out for the win, this fixture could see a high-scoring encounter.
– Krzysztof Piatek to score anytime: The Polish striker has been his team’s main goal threat and will be looking to add to his tally."

Match [&#8230;]","Concluding League A Group 1 of the 2024-25 UEFA Nations League, Croatia and Portugal lock horns in a top-of-the-table showdown at the Stadion Poljud in Split on Monday. The Selecao have already secured their spot in the quarter-finals as group winners, but Croatia need a point to guarantee their place in the knockout stages. Portugal have been in imperious form in the Nations League, sweeping aside the competition in customary fashion. Talisman Cristiano Ronaldo was responsible for two goals in their 5-1 thrashing of Poland on Friday, including an acrobatic overhead kick to bring up his 132nd international win – the most by any male player. Roberto Martinez’s side have lost just one of their previous 10 Nations League matches away from home, with that solitary defeat coming against Switzerland in June 2022. Croatia, on the other hand, have had a mixed bag of results since their 2-1 friendly victory over Portugal in the summer. After taking seven points from nine on offer between September 8 and October 15, the Chequered Ones squandered an opportunity to rubber-stamp a second-placed finish in the group, suffering a 1-0 loss to Scotland at Hampden Park. Portugal’s recent form has been nothing short of exemplary, winning four and drawing one of their last five competitive and non-competitive fixtures. In contrast, Croatia have won two, drawn one and lost two of their previous five matches across all competitions. Portugal hold a dominant 7-2 advantage over Croatia in their previous nine encounters, with the Selecao avenging their summer friendly defeat by the same scoreline in their first Nations League showdown of the year back in September. With top spot in the group already secured, Martinez has allowed some of his big-hitters, including Ronaldo, Bernardo Silva, and the suspended Bruno Fernandes, to head back to their clubs early. This could open the door for Fabio Silva and in-demand Sporting Lisbon full-back Geovany Quenda to feature. Livakovic; Pongracic, Caleta-Car, Sutalo, Gvardiol; Modric, Kovacic; L. Sucic, Pasalic, Perisic; Kramaric R. Silva; Cancelo, Djalo, Araujo, Tavares; Vitinha, Neves; Conceicao, Felix, Trincao; F. Silva With Martinez resting some of his key players, Croatia should be able to capitalize and secure the point they need to join Portugal in the Nations League quarter-finals. However, the Selecao’s wealth of talent means they are still likely to pose a significant threat, and a draw seems the most plausible outcome. – Both teams to score (Yes)
– Over 2.5 goals
– Fabio Silva to score anytime"

Serbia and Denmark go head-to-head, with the winner set to secure a spot in the competition’s quarter-finals. Serbia have had a mixed Nations League campaign so far, taking four points from Switzerland and only one from group leaders Spain. Despite the abundance of proven goalscorers in their squad, the Eagles have managed just three goals in five group games. Captain Aleksandar Mitrovic and Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic will be under pressure to deliver in this must-win finale. Denmark, on the other hand, suffered a setback in their last outing, losing 2-1 at home to Spain. However, they remain second in Group 4 and are 90 minutes away from reaching the Nations League’s new knockout stage. Former Brentford assistant Brian Riemer will take charge of his first away fixture as Denmark’s national team manager. Serbia’s recent form has been inconsistent, with two draws, two losses, and one win in their last five competitive matches. They’ll be hoping to build on their late equalizer against Switzerland and secure a vital victory on home soil. Denmark have been slightly more consistent, winning two, drawing one, and losing two of their last five games in all competitions. Their last defeat to Spain was their first loss in four matches. The Danes have a slight edge in the recent meetings between these two sides. They’ve won three of the last four games against Serbia, including a 2-0 victory in September, without conceding a goal. Serbia will be without the services of Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and his brother, goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic, while Torino’s Ivan Ilic is sidelined due to a knee injury. Denmark’s new coach, Brian Riemer, faces a tough decision upfront, with Rasmus Hojlund, Kasper Dolberg, and Yussuf Poulsen all vying for a starting berth. Serbia: 3-4-1-2 Petrovic; Stojic, Milenkovic, Pavlovic; Nedeljkovic, Maksimovic, Gudelj, Terzic; Samardzic; Vlahovic, Mitrovic Denmark: 4-2-3-1 Schmeichel; Bah, Andersen, Vestergaard, Kristiansen; Hjulmand, Hojbjerg; Skov Olsen, Eriksen, Dorgu; Hojlund With both teams desperate for a win, this is set to be a closely contested affair. While Serbia will have the home advantage, Denmark’s defensive solidity and counter-attacking threat could prove the difference. A 1-1 draw seems the most likely outcome, which would secure Denmark’s spot in the quarter-finals."

The game was suspended for 12 minutes when Hungary’s Adam Szalai suddenly fell ill on the sidelines, with medical staff rushing to attend to him. While the players waited anxiously, Netherlands striker Wout Weghorst stepped up and converted a penalty to give his team the lead once play resumed. However, Weghorst’s exuberant celebration was widely criticized by Dutch pundits, who felt the timing was insensitive given the troubling scenes that had just unfolded. When you score and celebrate like Wout Weghorst did, it really makes my stomach turn,” said former Tottenham star Rafael van der Vaart. “You also see the other players following him and thinking: ‘Oh, let’s just follow him.’ This could have been [more restrained].” Netherlands manager Ronald Koeman defended his player, saying Weghorst “must be happy that he scored the penalty.” But the striker later acknowledged the negative reaction, stating: “In hindsight, I understand the negative reactions, but it was just a relief on my part.” The match ultimately finished 4-0 to the Netherlands, but the unsavory incident cast a pall over the proceedings and sparked a wider debate about the appropriate behavior expected from players in such emotionally-charged situations."

The Roja have already secured their place in the quarter-finals, sitting top of the group with 13 points from five matches. Luis de la Fuente’s side have been in impressive form, winning each of their last four games after drawing their opener against Serbia. Spain have scored 10 goals and conceded just twice in the competition so far, with Mikel Oyarzabal and Ayoze Perez on the scoresheet in their 2-1 victory over Denmark on Friday. The European champions will be looking to finish their group stage on a high, with a number of fringe players expected to be given opportunities. In contrast, Switzerland’s Nations League campaign has been a disappointment. Murat Yakin’s team have picked up just two points from their five matches, confirming their relegation to League B. The Swiss drew 1-1 with Serbia last time out, with Zeki Amdouni scoring their goal. Switzerland have struggled for form, losing their first three matches against Denmark, Spain and Serbia before drawing at home against Denmark last month. Their only victory in all competitions since the European Championships came in a 2-0 win over Italy in the last 16. The two sides last met in September, with Spain running out 4-1 winners in the reverse fixture. Overall, Switzerland have only beaten Spain on two occasions, including a famous 1-0 victory at the 2010 World Cup. Spain have released Martin Zubimendi, Alex Baena and Mikel Oyarzabal from their squad, with the latter missing out through injury. However, Nico Williams, Dani Olmo and Alvaro Morata are all expected to feature. For Switzerland, Dereck Kutesa, Joel Monteiro and Andi Zeqiri could come into the starting lineup, with Breel Embolo potentially dropping to the bench. Despite Spain making changes, they should still have too much quality for an out-of-form Switzerland side. De la Fuente’s side are the reigning champions and have not lost a competitive match since March 2023. The Roja are expected to secure a comfortable 2-0 victory. With Spain already assured of their place in the quarter-finals and Switzerland relegated, the home side will be keen to end their group campaign on a positive note. The Roja’s superior quality should shine through, even with a rotated lineup."

The Atlas Lions have been in dominant form in Group B, winning all five of their matches so far and establishing an eight-point lead at the top of the table. Walid Regragui’s side kicked off their qualifying journey with a 4-1 thrashing of Gabon before recording a pair of comfortable victories over Lesotho and the Central African Republic. Morocco’s only blemish so far came in their most recent outing, a 5-1 triumph over Gabon, where they fell behind to an early Denis Bouanga strike before storming back. Brahim Diaz was the star of the show, scoring twice and providing an assist as the home side extended their unbeaten run. Lesotho, on the other hand, have endured a difficult start to their AFCON qualifying campaign. Leslie Notsi’s men suffered back-to-back defeats against the Central African Republic and Morocco to begin their journey, before claiming a hard-fought point against Gabon. However, Likuena finally got their first win on the board in their most recent match, a 1-0 victory over the Central African Republic. Neo Mokhachane scored the decisive goal to keep alive Lesotho’s slim hopes of securing a second-place finish in the group. The two sides met for the first time in September, with Morocco claiming a narrow 1-0 triumph. The Atlas Lions will be confident of completing the double over their opponents, having won four of the previous five meetings between the nations. Jamal Harkass scored his first international goal in Morocco’s win over Gabon, and the defender could be rewarded with a place in the starting XI. Ismael Saibari, who also impressed off the bench last time out, may also earn a starting berth. Lesotho will be boosted by the return of Neo Mokhachane, who netted the winner against the Central African Republic. Goalkeeper Sekhoane Moerane will be crucial to the visitors’ chances of securing a positive result. Morocco have been dominant in their qualifying campaign so far and should have too much quality for Lesotho. The Atlas Lions are expected to cruise to a comfortable victory and maintain their perfect record."

A [&#8230;]","As the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign draws to a close, Ghana will host Niger on Monday in a dead-rubber fixture, with the Black Stars already eliminated from contention. Otto Addo’s side have endured a dismal qualifying run, picking up just four points from their five matches in Group F. A 1-1 draw against Angola in their last outing condemned Ghana to their first failure to reach the AFCON in over two decades. The home side’s attacking woes have been a key factor in their downfall, with the two-time African champions managing just two goals so far. Leicester City’s Jordan Ayew scored a free-kick against Angola, but they were pegged back late on to share the spoils. Ghana’s last five AFCON qualifying results:
L 1-0 vs Angola
D 1-1 vs Angola
D 0-0 vs Sudan
L 2-0 vs Sudan
D 0-0 vs Niger With no chance of making it to the finals in Morocco, Monday’s clash at the Accra Sports Stadium will be a mere formality for the Black Stars. However, they will be keen to avoid the embarrassment of failing to win any of their six group stage matches. Meanwhile, Niger still harbor slim hopes of snatching a place in the AFCON, sitting third in the group, three points behind Sudan. The Mena picked up a crucial 4-0 win over Sudan in their last outing, with Youssouf Oumarou, Ousseni Badamassi and a brace from Daniel Sosah inspiring the victory. Niger’s last five AFCON qualifying results:
L 2-0 vs Angola
D 0-0 vs Ghana
L 1-0 vs Angola
L 2-1 vs Sudan
W 4-0 vs Sudan Despite their slim hopes, Niger face a daunting task against a Ghana side that has dominated the fixture in recent years. The Black Stars are unbeaten in 13 of the last 15 meetings between the two nations, winning 11 and drawing two since 1969. Ghana will be without the injured trio of Abdul Fatawu Issahaku, Jordan Ayew and Gideon Mensah for the clash. Niger, on the other hand, are expected to field a similar lineup to the one that thrashed Sudan, with Sosah leading the line. Ghana: 4-3-3 Nurudeen; Mensah, Simpson, Seidu, Schindler; Sulemana, Owusu, Baidoo; Annan, Konigsdorffer, Naumah Niger: 4-3-3 Djibo; Garba, Katkore, Sako, Alhassane; Oumarou, Badamassi, Mohamed; Hainikoye, Sosah, Amoustapha Despite their dismal qualifying campaign, Ghana should have enough quality to see off Niger at home. The Black Stars are tipped to claim a 1-0 victory in their final Group F fixture."

<h1>Canucks Conquer Blackhawks in a 4-1 Showdown, Brannstrom Shines</h1>
<h2>Brannstrom's Third Period Breakthrough</h2>
<p>Erik Brannstrom clinched a pivotal goal in the early stages of the third period, catapulting the Vancouver Canucks into the lead. The Canucks solidified their victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/chicago-blackhawks-reassign-key-players-to-bolster-development-strategy/"">Chicago Blackhawks</a> on Saturday night, thanks to a duo of last-minute empty-net goals, resulting in a 4-1 triumph.</p>
<h2>Key Contributors in the Canucks' Victory</h2>
<p><a href=""https://21sports.com/petterssons-power-play-prowess-propels-canucks-over-flames/"">Elias Pettersson</a> made his mark in the second period, while J.T. Miller and Quinn Hughes ensured victory by sending the puck sailing into an unguarded net. The Canucks' goalie, Arturs Silovs, displayed an impressive performance with 28 saves.</p>
<p>In an interesting turn of events, Chicago's Ilya Mikheyev, a former Canuck, scored against his previous team, providing an early lead for the Blackhawks. However, despite the anticipation, star forward Connor Bedard did not score in his debut NHL game in his hometown.</p>
<h3>Blackhawks' Performance</h3>
<p>Goalkeeper Arvid Soderblom made 29 saves for the Blackhawks. Mikheyev set the pace at 6:50 in the first period, masterfully flipping a rebound past a diving Silovs. However, the Canucks retaliated on their initial power play of the game in the second period, when Pettersson redirected a blind pass from Miller past Soderblom, with the puck deflecting off Chicago's Connor Murphy's skate.</p>
<p>Brannstrom displayed his prowess with a long deflection from the left side that went straight through Soderblom's legs and into the net.</p>
<h2>Game Highlights</h2>
<p>After suffering a disappointing 5-2 defeat to the New York Islanders on Thursday, the Canucks rebounded impressively against the Blackhawks, improving as the game progressed. Despite playing on Chicago's top line alongside Ryan Donato and Philipp Kurashev, Bedard couldn't break his scoring drought, extending it to three games.</p>
<h3>Turning Point of the Game</h3>
<p>A significant moment occurred with 5:45 remaining in the second period. With the score level at 1-1, Silovs expertly closed his pads to deny Nick Foligno an in-close breakaway opportunity.</p>
<h3>Outstanding Stat</h3>
<p>Pettersson's power-play goal marks his fifth of the season, with four of them coming in his last six games.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>The Canucks are preparing for their inaugural set of back-to-back games this season, hosting the Nashville Predators on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Blackhawks look forward to a two-game homestand against the Anaheim Ducks on Tuesday night.</p>

<h1>Dallas Stars Extend Winning Streak Against Minnesota Wild</h1>
<p><a href=""https://21sports.com/jets-soar-high-an-unprecedented-victory-over-stars-sets-nhl-record/"">Dallas Stars</a>, riding on the back of Mason Marchment's double strike and Ilya Lyubushkin's twin assists, emerged victorious with a 2-1 win over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/kings-rule-the-ice-a-dominant-5-1-win-over-the-wild/"">Minnesota Wild</a> on Saturday night. Jake Oettinger, the Stars' goaltender, blocked 22 shots, helping the team maintain their impressive form against the Wild with an 8-0-3 record in their last 11 regular season match-ups.</p>
<h2>A Superior Streak for Dallas Against Division Rival</h2>
<p>In the latest series of games between these divisional rivals, the Stars have shown an upper hand with a 6-0-1 record, outscoring the Wild 30-9. Oettinger, a native of Lakeville, Minnesota, located just 25 miles from the Xcel Energy Center, boasts a 6-0-1 record in nine career games - eight of which he started - against the Wild.</p>
<h3>Wild's Lone Goal and Gustavsson's Resilient Goalkeeping</h3>
<p>Kirill Kaprizov put the Wild on the scoreboard, while Filip Gustavsson put on a commendable display in the goal, stopping a season-best 38 shots. Gustavsson's performance this season has been exceptional, allowing two or fewer goals in a league-leading 10 starts.</p>
<h2>Highlights and Takeaways from the Game</h2>
<p>The Stars managed to match their season-high with 40 shots on goal, a whopping 17 more than the Wild. Despite missing forwards Mats Zuccarello and Joel Eriksson Ek due to lower-body injuries, the Wild introduced four new line combinations. Forward Michael Milne marked his NHL debut on the Wild's fourth line, while Liam Ohgren and Milne were brought up from AHL Iowa in recent days.</p>
<h3>Pivotal Moment of the Game</h3>
<p>A key turning point in the game came during a second-period Wild power play. Gustavsson denied Oskar Back a partial shorthanded breakaway after a turnover by Minnesota and blocked Matt Duchene moments after the Dallas penalty elapsed, maintaining a one-goal game.</p>
<h2>Impressive Stat for the Wild</h2>
<p>Despite the loss, the Wild have successfully neutralized 16 consecutive power plays since Nov. 7 in San Jose, showcasing their defensive prowess.</p>
<h2>What's Next for Both Teams?</h2>
<p>The Stars will return home to host Anaheim on Monday, while the Wild will begin a three-game road trip on Tuesday, starting with St. Louis.</p>

<h1>Bobrovsky and Barkov Lead Panthers to Stunning Shutout Against Jets</h1>
<p>Sergei Bobrovsky, the stalwart between the pipes, silenced 27 shots, recording his 45th career shutout, while Aleksander Barkov shone with a short-handed goal and a pair of assists. These key performances led the <a href=""https://21sports.com/florida-panthers-secure-long-term-home-with-broward-county/"">Florida Panthers</a> to a 5-0 victory, stunning the <a href=""https://21sports.com/jets-soar-high-an-unprecedented-victory-over-stars-sets-nhl-record/"">Winnipeg Jets</a>, who top the NHL, on Saturday night.</p>
<p>Sam Reinhart also played his part, with three assists helping the Panthers snap a two-game losing streak and become the premier team to lead the Jets by five goals this season. The Panthers, leading the Atlantic Division, also saw goals from Mackie Samoskevich, <a href=""https://21sports.com/rodrigues-rallies-panthers-to-seventh-successive-triumph-in-thrilling-shootout-against-flyers/"">Evan Rodrigues</a>, Nate Schmidt, and Dmitry Kulikov.</p>
<h2>Jets' Goalie Hellebuyck Takes a Hit</h2>
<p>Winnipeg's goalie, Connor Hellebuyck, entered the game boasting the NHL's best goals-against average at 1.92. However, after the Panthers’ attack scored five goals from 31 shots, his average swelled to 2.14. This resulted in his second loss in 14 games this season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Reinhart continued to demonstrate his form, registering points in 10 consecutive games, including his fourth three-point game of the season and his first three-assist regular season game since he managed four against Columbus on Dec. 10, 2023.</p>
<h3>Takeaways From the Game</h3>
<p>Despite the Jets' disappointing 0-2-0 record in Florida, their overall 15-3-0 record remains the best start in team history. Since the return of hockey to Winnipeg in 2011, no other Jets team has secured more than 11 wins in the first 18 games of a season.</p>
<p>On the Panthers' side, Samoskevich made a strong comeback to the lineup after sitting out during the loss to New Jersey on Thursday. He made his presence felt by scoring the game's opening goal - his third in the last seven games.</p>
<h2>Decisive Moment of the Game</h2>
<p>Bobrovsky showed his mettle with a key save, denying Mark Scheifele’s backhand shot halfway through the second period. This save preserved Florida's 2-0 lead. Soon after, Rodrigues and Barkov found the back of the net, giving the Panthers a commanding lead.</p>
<h3>Key Statistic</h3>
<p>One significant statistic stands out: the Panthers have already scored five short-handed goals this season (in 18 games), almost matching their total of eight from the previous regular season (in 82 games).</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>The teams will face each other again on Tuesday in Winnipeg.</p>

<h1>Marner's Stellar Overtime Performance Clinches 4-3 Triumph for Maple Leafs</h1>
<p><a href=""https://21sports.com/marner-propels-maple-leafs-to-victory-over-canadiens-a-hockey-night-recap/"">Mitch Marner</a> demonstrated his scoring prowess just 40 seconds into the overtime, powering the <a href=""https://21sports.com/maple-leafs-triumph-over-red-wings-marner-and-tavares-shine-in-nhl-clash/"">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> to an electrifying 4-3 win over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/edmonton-oilers-triumph-over-vancouver-canucks-a-night-of-stellar-performances/"">Edmonton Oilers</a> on a chilly Saturday night. The Oilers suffered a substantial blow in the second period when defenseman Darnell Nurse exited the game after a head-on collision with Ryan Reaves left him bloodied.</p>
<h2>Dual Goals from Bobby McMann Boost Leafs</h2>
<p>Bobby McMann, wearing the Maple Leafs' colors, illuminated the scoreboard twice, while Matthew Knies also found the net. Goalkeeper Anthony Stolarz, with a notable 27 saves, played an instrumental role in elevating Toronto's record to 11-6-2. Marner, not just a scorer on the night, also contributed an assist.</p>
<h3>Oilers' Winning Streak Snapped Despite McDavid and Draisaitl's Efforts</h3>
<p><a href=""https://21sports.com/mcdavids-brilliance-and-draisaitls-double-bring-down-islanders-oilers-thrilling-victory-recapped/"">Connor McDavid</a> and Leon Draisaitl of the Oilers tried to keep the winning streak alive, each scoring a goal and an assist. Despite their efforts and Adam Henrique's goal, the Oilers' three-game winning streak came to a halt. Stuart Skinner, Edmonton's keeper, managed to stop 18 shots.</p>
<p>Knies and McMann found the net within a minute of each other in the third period, propelling the Leafs to a 3-2 lead. However, Draisaitl orchestrated a comeback with a late goal, with Skinner leaving his post for an extra offensive player. Marner ended the deadlock in overtime, executing a flawless 2-on-1 with John Tavares.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways from the Game</h2>
<h3>Toronto Maple Leafs: Matthews Sidelined with Injury</h3>
<p>The Leafs' captain, Auston Matthews, could not contribute to the victory, missing his sixth consecutive game due to an undisclosed upper-body injury. The star center, whose status remains day-to-day, has not been in action since November 3.</p>
<h3>Edmonton Oilers: Lineup Adjustments and Injury Woes</h3>
<p>Edmonton's coach, Kris Knoblauch, had to adjust his lineup due to the absence of winger Viktor Arvidsson, who missed his second consecutive game due to an injury. The Oilers dressed 11 forwards and seven defensemen for the game.</p>
<h2>Turning Point of the Encounter</h2>
<p>The game saw a major turning point when Nurse, after wheeling around the Oilers' net in the second period, took a high hit from Reaves. The confrontation left Nurse bloodied and needing assistance off the ice, resulting in a match penalty for Reaves.</p>
<h3>Leafs' Max Domi in a Scoring Slump</h3>

The Oilers suffered a substantial blow in the second period when defenseman Darnell Nurse exited the game after a head-on collision with Ryan Reaves left him bloodied. Bobby McMann, wearing the Maple Leafs’ colors, illuminated the scoreboard twice, while Matthew Knies also found the net. Goalkeeper Anthony Stolarz, with a notable 27 saves, played an instrumental role in elevating Toronto’s record to 11-6-2. Marner, not just a scorer on the night, also contributed an assist. Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl of the Oilers tried to keep the winning streak alive, each scoring a goal and an assist. Despite their efforts and Adam Henrique’s goal, the Oilers’ three-game winning streak came to a halt. Stuart Skinner, Edmonton’s keeper, managed to stop 18 shots. Knies and McMann found the net within a minute of each other in the third period, propelling the Leafs to a 3-2 lead. However, Draisaitl orchestrated a comeback with a late goal, with Skinner leaving his post for an extra offensive player. Marner ended the deadlock in overtime, executing a flawless 2-on-1 with John Tavares. The Leafs’ captain, Auston Matthews, could not contribute to the victory, missing his sixth consecutive game due to an undisclosed upper-body injury. The star center, whose status remains day-to-day, has not been in action since November 3. Edmonton’s coach, Kris Knoblauch, had to adjust his lineup due to the absence of winger Viktor Arvidsson, who missed his second consecutive game due to an injury. The Oilers dressed 11 forwards and seven defensemen for the game. The game saw a major turning point when Nurse, after wheeling around the Oilers’ net in the second period, took a high hit from Reaves. The confrontation left Nurse bloodied and needing assistance off the ice, resulting in a match penalty for Reaves. Max Domi, a forward for the Leafs, has not scored a point in 13 games, a worrying trend for the 29-year-old who has no goals and only six assists this season. The Oilers will continue their three-match road trip with a clash against the Montreal Canadiens on Monday night.

<p>In a thrilling NHL faceoff on Saturday night, the <a href=""https://21sports.com/philadelphia-flyers-in-a-standoff-with-promising-goalkeeper-alexei-kolosov/"">Philadelphia Flyers</a> reigned supreme over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/thrilling-shootout-victory-sabres-douse-flames-in-nhl-showdown/"">Buffalo Sabres</a> with an impressive 5-2 victory. The limelight was stolen by Travis Konecny, who showcased his skills with two goals and an assist, propelling the Flyers to their third consecutive win.</p>

<h3>Game Highlights: Sabres Vs. Flyers</h3>
<p>For the Sabres, Dahlin emerges as a consistent performer with five goals and four assists during his points streak. The Flyers, on the other hand, are enjoying the rise of rookie Michkov. The 19-year-old, who was the No. 7 pick in the 2023 draft, has accumulated 15 points in just 16 games.</p>
<h2>The Turning Point: Konecny's Finishing Touch</h2>
<p>The game-changing moment arrived when Konecny teamed up with Michkov in a 2-on-0, leading the Flyers to a commanding 4-0 lead, effectively sealing the game's fate against the Sabres.</p>
<h3>The Milestone: Flyers' Erik Johnson's 1,000th Game</h3>

<h1>Suzuki Ignites Canadiens' Victory, Blue Jackets Left in the Cold</h1>
<p>In a thrilling NHL showdown on Saturday night, the <a href=""https://21sports.com/calgarys-flames-ignite-in-overtime-coronato-leads-to-3-2-victory-over-canadiens/"">Montreal Canadiens</a>, powered by a decisive second-period goal from Nick Suzuki, enjoyed a resounding 5-1 victory against the <a href=""https://21sports.com/columbus-blue-jackets-thrash-pittsburgh-penguins-ending-six-game-drought/"">Columbus Blue Jackets</a>. With additional goals by Mike Matheson, Lucas Condotta, Jake Evans, and Josh Anderson, Montreal has now claimed the second win in their last trio of games, following a challenging six-game losing streak.</p>
<h2>Montembeault’s Wall of Defense</h2>
<p>Sam Montembeault, the Canadiens goaltender, was an unyielding force on the ice, turning away 25 shots to secure the victory. This performance marks Montembeault's fifth win against the Blue Jackets - more than against any other NHL team in his career.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the only Blue Jackets' player to find the net was Dante Fabbro, registering his first goal since his transition from the Nashville Predators earlier in the week. Columbus' goaltender, Daniil Tarasov, matched Montembeault with 25 saves, but it wasn't enough to prevent Columbus from suffering their seventh loss in eight games.</p>
<h2>Power Play Prowess</h2>
<p>The Canadiens made good use of their power play opportunities, converting 1 out of 3 chances. This continues their streak of scoring a power-play goal in each of their victories this season.</p>
<p>An emotional moment before the game saw the Canadiens pay tribute to former captain Shea Weber, who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame earlier in the week.</p>
<h3>Takeaways and Highlights</h3>
<p>The Blue Jackets continue to show defensive vulnerabilities, conceding five or more goals for the fifth time this season. On the other hand, Montreal seems to have found their rhythm against Columbus, with this victory marking their sixth consecutive regular-season win dating back to November 2023, outscoring the Blue Jackets 27-9 over this period.</p>
<h3>The Deciding Moment</h3>
<p>With the game poised at 1-1 late in the second period, it was Suzuki who tilted the balance in Montreal's favor. Receiving a pass from Joel Armia at center ice, Suzuki launched an offensive assault, firing a snap shot past Tarasov's glove for his seventh goal of the season.</p>
<h3>A Milestone for Matheson</h3>
<p>Matheson's goal marked a significant achievement - the first power-play goal by a Canadiens defenseman this season, and his first since January 2024.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>The Canadiens will return to their home ice on Monday to face the Edmonton Oilers, while the Blue Jackets travel to meet the Boston Bruins.</p>

Earning his stripes during his second start of the season, and first before a home crowd, Martin proved his mettle in the third period with 11 remarkable saves.</p>
<h2>Hurricane's Offensive Prowess</h2>
<p>The Hurricanes displayed formidable offensive prowess, with Jordan Martinook, Sebastian Aho, newcomer Jackson Blake, and William Carrier lighting the lamp. Both Shayne Gostisbehere and Jordan Staal contributed with a couple of assists each, while <a href=""https://21sports.com/necas-last-minute-heroics-propel-hurricanes-to-seventh-consecutive-victory-over-persistent-flyers/"">Martin Necas</a> extended his career-best points streak to an impressive 12 games with an assist.</p>
<h3>Ottawa Senators: Blank Score Sheet</h3>

Blake piled on with another power-play goal early in the third period, and Carrier sealed the deal with an empty netter.</p>
<h2>Ottawa's Streak Broken, Carolina's Continues</h2>
<p>The Senators’ three-game points streak came to an abrupt halt, their special teams failing to perform after a solid four-game run without conceding a power-play goal. Their power-play unit also faltered, going 0 for 4.</p>
<p>Contrastingly, the Hurricanes continue to show their consistency, avoiding back-to-back losses this season. Returning from a three-game tour to the Western Conference, they celebrated their sixth consecutive home win.</p>
<h3>Game-Changing Moments and Stats</h3>
<p>The Hurricanes had been struggling with their power-play, converting only once in the previous three games (1 for 13). However, they turned the tide by scoring twice in a span of 85 seconds.</p>
<p>In another first, Martin became the third Hurricanes goaltender to register a win this season, reinforcing the team's depth in that position.</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>The Hurricanes will next welcome the St. Louis Blues on Sunday. On the other hand, the Senators will return home to kick off a four-game homestand, starting against the Edmonton Oilers on Tuesday.</p>

<h1>Brayden Schenn Steers Blues to Victory in Overtime Thriller Against Bruins</h1>
<p>Brayden Schenn emerged as the hero of the night, netting the puck 2:53 minutes into overtime, leading the St. Louis Blues to a nerve-racking 3-2 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/pastrnaks-late-strike-seals-bruins-thrilling-comeback-victory-over-blues/"">Boston Bruins</a> on Saturday. This victory was a much-needed respite for the Blues, drawing a line under their four-game losing run.</p>
<h2>Homegrown Hero Frederic Shines for Bruins</h2>
<p>St. Louis-born Trent Frederic was the star performer for Boston, scoring both goals for his team. The Bruins have had a mixed run recently, with a record of 2-1-2 in their latest five outings. Nathan Walker came to the Blues' rescue, tying the game in the middle of the third period when the Bruins were holding onto a slim 2-1 lead.</p>
<h2>Early Advantage for Blues Evaporates</h2>
<p>The Blues started on a promising note, with Radek Faksa giving them a 1-0 lead just 6:25 into the game. However, Frederic, the 26-year-old sensation, quickly turned the tables with two goals in less than three minutes. His first goal was a superb finish from the top of the crease, courtesy of a well-placed pass from Georgii Merkulov, a recent call-up from AHL Providence.</p>
<p>Frederic's second goal came off a tip from Mason Lohrei's shot from the point. Positioned to the right of goalie Jordan Binnington, he managed to redirect the puck inside the far post, stunning the Blues momentarily.</p>
<h2>Rematch of the Week</h2>
<p>It was the second face-off between these two teams this week, with the Bruins having come from behind to secure a 3-2 win against the Blues in St. Louis on Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways from the Game</h3>
<p>The Blues appeared more focused and determined after being outscored 19-8 in their last four games, during which they conceded at least four goals thrice. On the other hand, the Bruins, coming off a disappointing 7-2 loss at Dallas, managed to tighten their defense early on but suffered numerous breakdowns in the second and early in the third period.</p>
<h3>Key Moment</h3>
<p>Boston coach Jim Montgomery called for a timeout with six minutes remaining in the second period as his team struggled to maintain control of the puck for extended periods.</p>
<h3>Notable Stat</h3>
<p>Goalie Jordan Binnington is just one win short of tying Mike Liut's franchise record of 151 wins. Binnington's career highlight came in 2019 when he led the Blues to a Stanley Cup victory over the Bruins in Game 7 at Boston.</p>
<h2>What's Next for Both Teams?</h2>
<p>The Blues are set for a swift return to action, facing Carolina on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Bruins will host Columbus on Tuesday.</p>

He’s not just a gymnast—he’s a puzzle master, a dancer, a reality TV star, and someone who has two eye diseases. He’s the perfect mix of skill and imperfection, yet the way he carries himself is truly one of a kind. This 26-year-old U.S. gymnast clinched third place on the pommel horse just five days after helping Team USA win a bronze medal—its first in 16 years. Along the way, he’s captured the hearts of fans with his nerdy yet endearing personality. After going viral during the 2024 Olympics for both his win and his nerdy charm, Nedoroscik entered a new world by competing on —and he’s absolutely crushing it there, too. What lies ahead for this athlete, you may wonder? It seems he has no intention of slowing down, as his sights are now firmly set on the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. But here’s the catch—it’s not about the financial gain. Sure, a medal could bring him like $15,000 for bronze or $37,500 for gold; Nedoroscik’s genuine drive stems from a more profound source. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Recently, on November 15, Stephen Nedoroscik made an appearance on the Shawn & Andrew Podcasts, hosted by former Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson and former NFL player Andrew East. During the conversation about his career, Shawn asked him, “Are you going to run for 28?” referring to the LA 2028 Olympics. With a beautiful smile, Nedoroscik responded, “100%, like that has always been the goal. I literally said it before 2024, I was like, no matter what happens, I’m going for 2028. I just love the sport too much to let it go.” Andrew East then inquired about Stephens’ motivations. Whether he was driven by the challenge of solving puzzles or the desire, for gain and recognition; however Stephens’ response was purely of an Olympian. He shared what you might expect from someone truly driven by passion, saying, “It’s not financial at all. In fact, I didn’t expect to really make any money off of gymnastics. I think it’s more of just a pride thing.” Stephen Nedoroscik further added, “So it’s like, I don’t know when the journey will end, but as long as I’m getting better and still enjoying the sport and my body can handle it, I’m going to continue. 100% going to continue.” However, as an athlete aiming for excellence in their field of expertise. The inquiry that lingers is this: what is the actual income an athlete can expect from participating in such an event as the Olympics? During the Olympics competition stage athletes may face discrepancies, between their accomplishments and financial rewards. It has been noted that gymnasts who do not secure any medals do not receive any compensation for their work. However, those who successfully earn a medal do get some rewards although it may not be deemed significant for them to retire early or anything of the sort. In the United States athletes receive $15,000 for clinching a bronze medal $22,500 for securing silver and $37,500 for grabbing the gold. The query that comes to our minds is this; how much money does Stephen Nedoroscik make from his accomplishments. Nedoroscik has a net worth estimated to be around $1 million, as of 2024. Looking ahead, Nedoroscik doesn’t plan to slow down anytime soon. While gymnastics and dancing are taking center stage for now, he’s also got his electrical engineering degree to fall back on in the future. “I’m like that sort of nerdy guy that was in your math class. I love chess. I love Rubik’s cubes. I’m an electrical engineer,” he says. “There’s a certain stigma that comes with being a horse guy and it’s that you’re kind of quirky, kind of nerdy. I just want people to know I’m just a regular dude who’s managed to find his talent on the pommel horse and has gone very far with it.” With his mix of skills and passions, Stephen Nedoroscik isn’t just sitting on his laurels. Whatever comes next, you can bet he’ll roll with the punches and give it his all, just like he always has.

If there’s one thing Kenny Wallace knows how to do, it’s tell a good story. The NASCAR veteran and fan-favorite personality recently had listeners in stitches on his “Herm & Schrader” podcast when he recounted a side-splitting tale about his older brother, Rusty Wallace. The story took a detour down memory lane to a time before Rusty was the NASCAR legend we know today — a time when he was just trying to balance a regular job with his dreams of racing. Kenny set the stage for this epic story by reminiscing about the days when he and Rusty, alongside NASCAR crew chief Paul Andrews, worked at their Uncle Gary’s janitorial supply business, “Okay Vacuum & Janitorial.” What followed was a story of frustration, determination, and an accidental mishap that turned out to be a blessing in disguise. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Kenny Wallace kicked off the story by explaining the tough choice Rusty and Paul faced in their early days. Every Friday night, the Wallace brothers would head to the Ozark Empire Fairgrounds in Springfield, Missouri, to race. But here’s the kicker: they still had to punch the clock at Uncle Gary’s business before they could hit the dirt track. “Every Friday night, we’d run Springfield, Missouri, Ozark Empire Fairgrounds,” Kenny shared with his co-host, Ken Schrader, on the podcast. “Uncle Gary says, ‘You boys need to decide if you’re going to be race car drivers or work here!” This ultimatum came down to a tough decision. Were they going to keep chasing their racing dreams, or stick to their day job? The Wallace brothers were itching to hit the track. As Kenny put it, “They’re like, ‘Oh boy, we have to leave at like 3-3:30 to make it.’ That’s for the first heat.” But Uncle Gary wasn’t about to make it easy on them. In a hilarious twist, he decided to put Rusty to the test one fateful Friday. As the story goes, Uncle Gary gave Rusty Wallace what seemed like a simple, but time-consuming task: deliver a 55-gallon drum of chemical supplies across state lines to Illinois. The only catch? The clock was ticking, and Rusty had a race to get to. You can almost hear the frustration in Rusty’s voice as Kenny describes the scene. “He hands Rusty this sheet of paper and goes, ‘I need you to deliver this 55-gallon drum of chemical to Illinois,’” Kenny recounted with a chuckle. “Rusty is pissed.” Rusty, eager to get the job done and hit the road, loaded up the box truck — a clunky vehicle with a back held together by chains instead of a roll-down door. Kenny painted a vivid picture of Rusty’s mood: “He’s so mad. He starts gear banging, WOMP WOMP WOMP, goes across all these railroad tracks, backs that baby up. Beep beep beep.”     A post shared by Dirty Mo Media (@dirtymomedia)  Was Uncle Gary's ultimatum the best thing that ever happened to Rusty Wallace's racing dreams? Debate But as Murphy’s Law would have it, things didn’t go as planned. When Rusty Wallace arrived at his destination, ready to hand over the goods, there was just one problem. The guy waiting for the delivery looked at Rusty and asked, “What 55 gallons?!” The realization hit Rusty like a ton of bricks. “Rusty says, ‘Oh no, I know right where it’s at!’” Kenny laughed, recalling the story. That 55-gallon drum had bounced right out of the truck bed somewhere near the river on his way to Illinois. By the time Rusty made it back to the shop, Uncle Gary had had enough. Rusty’s days at “Okay Vacuum & Janitorial” were over. Kenny’s conclusion? It was the best thing that could have happened to Rusty. “So Gary fired him. It was the best thing to have happened!” he said, clearly amused by how it all played out. While it may have been a tough blow, Uncle Gary turned out to be a pivotal moment for Rusty Wallace. No longer tethered to the family business, Rusty focused entirely on his passion for racing. And as history shows, that gamble paid off big time. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Rusty Wallace went on to become one of the most successful drivers in NASCAR history, clinching the 1989 Cup Series Championship, earning 55 Cup Series wins, and eventually being inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame in 2013. Who knew that losing a job over a spilled drum of chemicals could lead to such a legendary racing career? Rusty himself has often spoken about the early struggles of making it in the racing world, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and passion. And it’s stories like these, shared by his younger brother Kenny, that offer a glimpse into the gritty, behind-the-scenes moments that shaped NASCAR legends. As Kenny Wallace’s storytelling reminds us, sometimes life’s funniest mishaps lead to the greatest successes. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad What followed was an incredibly successful career. Wallace won the Rookie of the Year title in 1984 and never looked back. Concluding a career that spans over 40 years, Rusty Wallace put an ever-lasting mark on the world of NASCAR. His success with Roger Penske‘s team will always be one that remains in the hearts and minds of fans. It even spawned a 16-year streak where Wallace won at least one race every single year. Eventually, after calling it quits from the grueling life of stock car racing, Rusty Wallace continued ownership of his team. He even fielded his son Steve Wallace in one car. However, RWR shut down at the end of 2013. At the moment, Wallace continues his love for racing as an analyst. Let the world know your perspective.

during the NCAA men’s basketball game against the Alabama Crimson Tide at Mackey
Arena in West Lafayette, Ind. Purdue Boilermakers won 87-78. Debate Is Braden Smith the real deal, or will Purdue miss Edey's dominance in the long run? Zach Edey’s move to the NBA meant, for many, that the Purdue Boilermakers were done and dusted. The Matt Painter-led team reached last year’s Championship Finals, propelled by Edey’s 25 points with 12 rebounds per game. However, as the 22-year-old was drafted by the Memphis Grizzlies, another 6 feet 6 inches baller replaced him as the leader. Initially, some analysts backed off from supporting the team. But as the Boilermakers continue to advance, winning all four games, they have once again earned the trust of their critics over their Big 10 rivals. On Saturday’s episode of The Field Of 68: After Dark, Rob Dauster regretted the words that he had spoken about the Boilermakers at the beginning of the season and instead admitted that the tables had indeed turned for them. “I’ve flip-flopped on this. I’ve gone the opposite of what I said in the preseason. I thought I wanted it to be Indiana and I think, I at this point… I’ve seen enough to say that I would be on the Purdue bandwagon here. I think that there is enough talent on that roster. To me, the win over Alabama really said a lot for a couple of reasons,” Dauster stated. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad When the season had begun with Braden Smith replacing Edey, Dauster had opined that the Indiana Hoosiers are the team to look forward to in the Big 10 instead of Purdue. Citing that the Hoosiers “spent a lot of money and brought this class,” he was clear that they had no option but to win. However, as the tournament progressed, he changed his views and obviously, he has his reasons. “One, you could run everything through Trey Kaufman-Renn and be able to get what you needed to get out of him to win one-on-one matchups. He did a lot against a guy that we thought was going to be an elite defender in Clifford Omoruyi. I think that Fletcher Loyer has shown that he has the ability this year to be a little bit more of a go-to guy. I don’t think he’s going to be a breakdown, the dribble guy. I do think that you can run some stuff for him that will be a little bit more creative and he can be a little bit more impactful,” Dauster backed his thoughts. USA Today via Reuters Mar 28, 2024; Detroit, MN, USA; Purdue Boilermakers guard Braden Smith (3) speaks with the media during the NCAA Tournament Midwest Regional-Practice at Little Caesars Arena. Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports Despite Alabama’s exceptional defender Clifford Omoruyi (9.8 ppg; 7.8 rpg), the Boilermakers star Trey Kaufman-Renn scored a career-high 26 points on Friday night against the Crimson Tide, helping his team to an 87-78 win. Similarly, the Boilermakers have another offensive star in Fletcher Loyer who averages 17 points per game for the team. He was the team’s highest scorer in their first two games with 21 and 16 points, respectively. “CJ Cox, man, like I think that dude is a rocket ship. I think that he is a guy that is going to, by the end of the year, be that secondary creator and playmaker that we needed, and you still got the opportunity for Myles Colvin and Camden Heide to take a step forward and oh, by the way! You might have the best point guard in America. I’m not saying you do but you might have the best point guard in America,” Dauster concluded. Is Braden Smith the real deal, or will Purdue miss Edey's dominance in the long run? Debate Similarly, the Boilermakers have found another impressive athlete in CJ Cox who has given his best whenever the situation demands. For instance, he hit 12 points against Yale and 11 points against Alabama. Dauster also praised Camden Heide and Myles Colvin who are trying to up their ante, which is evident by the 14 points Colvin scored against Texas A&M-Corpus Christi. Therefore, this looked like taking a U-turn after Dauster had previously chosen Indiana over Purdue. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The Field of 68 hosts, before the season had begun, picked Indiana over Purdue. In an exclusive for Awful Announcing, Dauster was clear that Indiana was more talented. The Hoosiers have transfers such as Oumar Ballo and Kanaan Carlyle, who strengthen an already formidable Indiana team. Notably, Ballo transferred from Arizona after averaging 12.9 points with 10 rebounds per game. Similarly, sophomore Carlyle averaged 11.5 points for Stanford last season. “I think Indiana is the most talented team, and I would bet on Purdue being the team that has the best record. I trust Purdue and Matt Painter to find a way to win more games… It’s Indiana. If you don’t make the tournament, it doesn’t matter who you are, your seat’s going to be hot. They expect to win… This year, they spent a lot of money and brought this class, so you have to win. I also think they’re probably going to be able to do enough to win and get to the tournament.,” Dauster spoke while acknowledging that Purdue has a better all-time win-loss record. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad They stand with 1947–1064 (.647) while the Hoosiers have a 1,934-1,117 (.634). Meanwhile, other basketball analysts had the same view on the Field of 68 podcast. Hopefully, Dauster’s words will add fuel to the fire for Purdue, who will go ahead to somewhere push the Hoosiers below them as both are ranked at the top spot in Big Ten as of now.

Bleeding from an intense showdown and battling a knee injury, Carter Starocci proved why he’s one of wrestling’s all-time greats—but even champions admit mistakes. The Penn State wrestler injured his knee during the regular-season finale against Edinboro University on February 25, 2024. His relentless drive to overcome physical challenges highlights his unyielding pursuit of excellence, as seen in the recent match. He entered an exhibition match at the NWCA All-Star Classic, and despite two tie-ups, he finally managed to earn the victory. Despite his monumental success, Starocci is far from complacent and not fully satisfied with his performance. What did he miss, and how did he plan to set it right? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The NWCA All-Star Classic wasn’t just a stage for Starocci to showcase his skills—it was also a critical learning moment. After competing in the 174-pound weight class for four years, the 23-year-old wrestled in the 184-pound category for the first time and gained a win over Parker Keckeisen by 4-1. He grabbed the victory with just 0:27 left on the timer, though he ended up with an injury on his face and blood flowing down his forehead. But still, he stands strong. However, even after winning the match, the four-time NCAA champion still seems unsatisfied. Starocci focused on his inability to consistently score on the mat. Reflecting on his performance, “If that match happens again, just make sure I’m ready to put some more points on the board.” The battle between Starocci and Keckeisen lasted for three whole periods. But Starocci could only earn points at the end and not throughout the match as it was only at the end he took over, resulting in a tough fight between the two. Starocci admitted that he controlled the bout but could have done much better. He said, “Obviously I felt like I controlled the match and things like that, but it’s all good. While talking about the prospect of a rematch against Keckeisen, Starocci said, “Obviously, you don’t want matches to go in overtime, but I mean, he’s a tough, strong kid, and he’s a guy that’s probably looking forward to the next match-up again if it happens.” Is Carter Starocci's dissatisfaction a sign of greatness or unnecessary pressure on himself? Debate Starocci further added, “So that’s my job to make sure that I’m also ready. It’s not even about him or anything; it’s just about getting better and things like that. I’ll make sure that I take care of business every single time.” Let us see how the Penn State wrestler earned a hard-fought victory in his new weight category.  For the 23-year-old, it was getting difficult to manage weight which often crept higher. So, he decided to compete in a higher weight category without worrying about the weight and only focus on skills. He even mentioned that in an interview earlier, even his coach Cael Sanderson agreed that managing Starocci’s weight is not easy. Hence, the Penn State wrestler fought in the 184-pound category and made a change. He managed to win the NWCA All-Star match with a pang in the heart, to perform better. But amid this, Starocci still managed to overshadow his Penn State teammate, Shayne Van Ness who was making his return after a one-year layoff. Van Ness wrote down victory in his name with a major decision of 16-4 against Ty Watters.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad It is interesting to note that the duo returned to the mat after overcoming their injury battle. This was Starocci’s final year at NCAA wrestling, and he performed his heart out to win his bouts. One outshining the other, especially when belonging to the same state—which is quite painful. Even though Van Ness scored well in his bout, it was Starocci who took the ultimate victory of the night.

The Buffs are turning tides for real. From the worst 2023 power conference to a strong SEC contender, Deion Sanders did wonders to rebuild a struggling team, and it paid off big time. Despite facing a hitch against Kansas State, the program bounced back immediately. A dominant win against the Arizona Wildcats had all but Travis Hunter’s usual Heisman aura. But the Buffs were listening. During the next game against Cincinnati, Hunter and Shedeur let the world know why they have been widely known as one of the most dangerous duos in college football. The streak continues through another uplifting scoreboard against Texas Tech. Now, this week, it was Utah’s turn to get cooked with Shilo Sanders taking the aim. Shilo has always been the unsung song of Coach Prime, and not for nothing. He often fails to live up to the standard set by his brother, Shedeur Sanders, and Travis Hunter. But the kid knew when to steal the spotlight. He struck the iron right at the moment, and it is, all of a sudden, a full circle moment for Colorado and dad Deion Sanders. With just under three and a half minutes left in the clock and the Buffaloes leading with a 42-24, the Utes fronted on to a 4th and 13 play. The Buffs didn’t let it go. When the opponent’s linebackers rushed the passer before dropping back, Shilo Sanders found room to attack. He smacked Utah QB Isaac Wilson and forced a fumble only to be redeemed by the defense. Travis Hunter was there to take care of the days in the next plays. You might think it was a fluke for Deion’s less-celebrated son. But it was not. In a viral clip, Shilo Sanders was spotted streaming to his dad, ‘‘Something big is gonna happen”. The rest is history. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Shilo Sanders with the SACK 🔋@CUBuffsFootball pic.twitter.com/F9BcG2yxAI — FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) November 16, 2024 Expand Tweet  Shilo, who had been down with a forearm injury since the Nebraska game and could barely suit up for the Kansas State game. But the half-fit return of his into the secondary turned out even more horrible to bear with. While addressing the woes, coach Sanders didn’t, at all, sugarcoat his words.“I thought he played horrible. I thought he was rusty”, Sanders called the kid out for his unforgivable missed open-field tackles and blown coverages. But Deion has always been the constructive critic, keeping his son’s boundless potential in mind. “I know what he has in him.”, Sanders affirmed the world as well as himself. Finally, the dad sentiment found room to settle after the blowout Utah game. However, Shilo Sanders not only won over the naysayers with a lofty score but also won a fan’s heart. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Is Shilo Sanders finally stepping out of his brother's shadow with his recent standout performances? Debate After the game, Shilo Sanders had a heart-melting exchange with a young superfan on the sidelines. In a video going viral on social media, Shilo was spotted having his moment with a specially-abled superfan, Cash Harris, near the tunnel. The athlete extended a handwarm shake, making the little one’s entire day. Harris caught the attention of the Sanders’ son while relentlessly rooting for the Buffs’ in their jersey. But it’s not just Shilo Sanders. Colorado Buffs are all heart. If you are a fan, you can no way miss out on the Peggy Coppom story swirling over the news bites for a while. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Colorado’s 99-year-old superfan garnered the tag of “drip queen” in February when she was gracing the Buffs offensive line in a CU bomber jacket. The media hype brought him even closer to Deion Sanders and the entire Colorado team. She even demanded a playoff entry from Sanders and co and got her wish fulfilled. But the unique yet thrilling intel is she, as a first-ever fan, received a special NIL deal. ”In a historic first, Miss Peggy is the first fan to receive a NIL deal, with $1 from each sleeve sold going to her—a small gesture for her lifetime of dedication. Miss Peggy’s legacy inspires not just players but entire generations.”, the official statement reads. Let the world know your perspective.

The Broncos are finally taking on the Falcons, and the stakes are high. Denver ain’t doing that great this season with 5 massive losses, on the other hand, Atlanta is still in a safe spot with 6 wins and 4 losses. The final result of the showdown will solely depend on how well the Broncos manage to tackle the Falcons’ Bijan Robinson and Tyler Allgeier duo on that turf. You have to agree, the Falcons arguably have one of the best running back tandem in the entire country and this could easily turn the game around in their favor. While both teams get set to hit it off, we spotted a surprising Dirty Bird fan who has got Coach Prime‘s daughter to have quite the laugh. Back on Deiondra Sanders‘ Instagram, she shared a clip of her fiancee Jacquees flexing quite the bizarre thing. “Got my NFL gloves on,” Jacquees mentioned in the clip while getting a pair of white NFL gloves on. “It’s going down today….. shout-out to my boys,” Jacquees noted. Coming from Atlanta, it ain’t no wonder why Jacq is in full support of the Falcons. And honestly, the Dirty Birds need it all. via Imago Credits: Imago See, while we did point out that the Falcons have the offensive power, you also gotta keep in mind that they have to rely on a rookie QB to get them out of this. If that wasn’t bad enough, the injuries on the roster mark a grim future. 7 players are out for the Falcons and out of them losing Dee Alford and Troy Andersen, deals a massive blow to the D-line. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad However, not everything is sunshine and rainbows for the Broncos. The leading Safety Brandon Jones is out for this showdown because of an abdominal injury. This means the team is going to lose out on a guy who has been carrying with 74 stops this season. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Literally one of the most impactful players for Denver is out, and that gives the Falcons offense a 1-up. However, anything can happen on the gridiron so we still gotta wait and watch the entire game, but before that, why not focus on Deiondra? For the Sanders, it was a day of pure joy when Baby Snow finally graced the world. See, at this point, everyone knows about the struggles Deiondra had to go through during her pregnancy. Being diagnosed with fibroids, getting pregnant was next to impossible, but somehow the Sanders always know how to defy all odds. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Can the Broncos overcome their setbacks, or will the Falcons' running duo seal their fate? Debate When Buffs and Deion Sanders were taking on Texas Tech, Snow was there cheering for his grandpa. “Snow LOVE watching football. He knows what’s up lol,” Deiondra had mentioned while sharing a photo of Snow watching the game. It is finally good to watch Deiondra explore life again after the entire childbirth. With her and Jacq making trips again, we cannot wait to spot them in the crowd when Deion Sanders finally takes the Buffs to the Big 12 Championship Games. Let the world know your perspective.

Deommodore Lenoir’s rise as a key player for the 49ers hasn’t gone unnoticed, especially by head coach Kyle Shanahan. But is it just his physical skills and big-play abilities that have impressed Kyle? No, in fact Lenoir’s mindset and willingness to embrace tough challenges have set him apart. What Shanahan had to say about Lenoir’s development shows how much trust and belief the coach has in him. It’s clear that Lenoir is more than just another cornerback on the field. But what exactly makes Deommodore Lenoir so special? During the interview, Shanahan explained how Lenoir has shown confidence in taking on the league’s toughest receivers, including DK Metcalf. “I remember with Mooney [Charvarius] being out he’s texting me all the way up to the Thursday game [Week 6] asking if he can follow DK around,” Kyle revealed. Lenoir not only asked to take on Metcalf but sent the 49ers head coach videos of his previous games to prove how ready he was. Isn’t that the kind of dedication and self-assurance that defines a next-level player prepared to tackle any challenges? With 6 passes defended and 1 interception this season, Deommodore Lenoir is proving that he’s ready to take on those challenges.   ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Kyle Shanahan on Deommodore Lenoir: “He has the confidence to guard anybody. I remember with Mooney [Charvarius] being out he’s texting me all the way up to the Thursday game [week 6] asking if he can follow DK [Metcalf] around. Sending me videos of every time he’s guarded him.… pic.twitter.com/pt8ZrMptsX — Coach Yac 🗣 (@Coach_Yac) November 16, 2024 Expand Tweet  What makes Lenoir even more remarkable, according to Shanahan, is the comparison to Jimmie Ward. Jimmie, who now plays for the Houston Texans, was one of the 49ers’ most reliable defensive backs. Shanahan noted that “Lenoir “reminds me a ton of how Jimmy Ward was,” hinting at their ability to excel, particularly in the nickel cornerback role. Ward’s physicality was legendary, and Lenoir’s 50+ tackles this season have earned him a similar reputation. Lenoir’s ability to cover wide receivers while still being effective against the run mirrors Ward’s playstyle, making him an invaluable asset to the 49ers’ defense. With the Seahawks coming to town in Week 11, Lenoir’s challenge will be to limit DK Metcalf, who already has over 800 yards and 7 touchdowns this season. Metcalf’s performance this season has continued to be explosive, averaging over 15 yards per reception. Lenoir’s ability to shut him down will likely determine the outcome of the game. If Deommodore Lenoir executes the same strategy that Shanahan believes in, the 49ers will have a good shot at winning this crucial NFL West game. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Can Deommodore Lenoir shut down DK Metcalf and prove he's the 49ers' defensive cornerstone? Debate The week 11 NFC West game between the 49ers and the Seahawks is crucial for both teams. The 49ers are coming off with a strong performance in week 10, but with a 5-4 record, they need a win to stay competitive in the division. The team is trying to regain its footing after a rocky start to the season. Meanwhile, the Seahawks head into their next game sitting at 6-3, looking to create some space between them and the 49ers in the NFC West. The 49ers’ defense has been one of the league’s best, but they have had their hiccups. Geno Smith has been electrifying this season, throwing for over 500 yards. And then the Seahawks also have DK Metcalf. With 55 catches and 7 touchdowns so far, he is a walking nightmare for any defense unit. Stopping him won’t be easy at all, and Deommodore Lenoir is the man tasked with the challenge. Lenoir has had his share of struggles, allowing five TDs this season, but his fans are hoping this time could be different. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The Seahawks’ defense tells its own story. They have done a good job pressuring quarterbacks, with 27 sacks this season, but their defense has been shaky. And that’s where Christian McCaffrey comes in. After battling Achilles tendinitis, he looked like his old self in week 10. If McCaffrey can get the run game going, it will force Seattle’s defense to commit.   And then we have the Metcalf vs. Lenoir situation going on. Metcalf has had the edge in their previous encounters, but Lenoir’s made noticeable progress this season. If Deommodore Lenoir can keep Metcalf from making those jaw-dropping big plays, the 49ers will have a real shot at controlling the game. Let the world know your perspective.

He expressed a desire for them to lose 3-0, viewing it as a necessary “wake-up call” for coach Mauricio Pochettino, who opted not to field Pulisic in that game.

Not the Olympics, but that cube. It just goes to show, that when it comes to being laser-focused, Stephen’s got it in spades. After that, Stephen was brought onto Team USA as the pommel horse specialist, filling a spot the men’s team needed. What seemed like a weak link for them turned into their secret weapon. With his glasses off, due to a condition called strabismus (where his eyes cross), he stepped up and nailed a flawless 45-second routine that earned him the only individual medal for a U.S. men’s gymnastics. Nedoroscik’s routine scored 15.300, securing Team USA’s first Olympic medal in 16 years — a bronze. If he could solve that Rubik’s cube with such precision, why couldn’t he go toe-to-toe with the best in the world? Now, with the 2028 Olympics on his radar, Stephen’s not resting on his laurels. He’s all in, saying, “I’m going for 2028. I just love the sport too much to let it go. As long as I’m getting better, still enjoying it, and my body can handle it, I’m going to continue. 100% going to continue.” Talk about going the extra mile! He’s got his eyes on the prize, and nothing is going to stop him from reaching it. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad So, what keeps him motivated? It’s not just his love for the sport. Stephen recently opened up about what truly drives him. On November 15th, he appeared on the Shawn & Andrew Podcast, hosted by former Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson and former NFL player Andrew East. During their conversation about competition, Stephen was asked who he looks up to in gymnastics. His answer? “I look up to the people I’m worried about, you know, the people who can beat me.” Stephen Nedoroscik isn’t driven by medals or applause; his motivation stems from a pursuit of being the best. He continued, “I want to be the best in the world, and right now, I’m looking at this dude who’s a little better than me, so I’m going to keep chasing him until I’m better.” From gymnastics to dance floors, is Stephen Nedoroscik redefining what it means to be an athlete? Debate Looking forward to the 2028 Olympics, with Stephen’s dedication in mind only emphasizes how his drive will continue to intensify over time. What is truly remarkable is his willingness to embrace imperfections while striving for excellence, beyond boundaries. It’s fascinating to note that he used to be a youngster completely disinterested in sports—yes including gymnastics! In the same podcast episode, Stephen Nedoroscik mentioned that during his childhood he didn’t pay attention to gymnastics. “I enjoyed doing the sport so much, but I never really had a role model in it whatsoever,” he explained. It was when he reached college that he started considering who his role models were and discovered that his fellow competitors were the ones who motivated him the most. Now seeing where he is today—it’s clear that while gymnastics remains his passion, his love for dancing has also blossomed. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “Never in my life would I have thought I could do a jive,” Nedoroscik said, yet he did it. After his success in Paris, Stephen joined Dancing with the Stars, where he initially felt unsure about his dancing skills, even admitting he was “a very cowardly and scared dancer.” But fast forward to Week 9, and he’s proven himself more than capable. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Even last week, Stephen Nedoroscik brought it on during the show’s November 12th episode. He and his partner, Rylee Arnold, took on a Viennese waltz to “Glimpse of Us” by Joji, recreating a routine Charli D’Amelio had performed before. And there, they scored 29/30, with two perfect tens and one nine. But that wasn’t all! In the instant dance round, Stephen had to pull off a jive to Olivia Rodrigo’s “Love is Embarrassing,” earning a solid 25/30. In the end, he scored a total of 54/60 for the night, proving he’s not just a gymnast — he’s got serious dance moves too! He’s the kind of guy who keeps his nose to the grindstone, no distractions, no shortcuts — just pure determination. How do you see Stephen Nedoroscik’s career unfolding?

The long-awaited NASCAR Xfinity Series championship for Justin Allgaier last Saturday night felt like a fairytale. In a race that tested him to the limit, Allgaier rallied from a lap down, charging through the double-overtime laps to finish second but win the series championship. Despite Herbst’s No. 98 Ford edging past him on the last lap, Allgaier continued to celebrate with matching burnouts, marking the win. Jim Pohlman, crew chief for Allgaier’s No. 7, was just as excited about the win as Allgaier was. Having worked with Allgaier in the 2008 ARCA Series, Pohlman was delighted to see his driver finally earn NASCAR’s top Xfinity honor. In a SiriusXM NASCAR radio interview with Pohlman after the victory, he didn’t fail to mention the teamwork and high-stakes adjustments that helped them win. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad After Allgier’s primary totaled, a dedicated group of shop personnel spent the week meticulously setting up his backup car to ensure it was as close to race-ready as possible. And that turned out to be crucial when the team had to rely on the backup in Phoenix.  During practice, Justin Allgaier slid through an oil spill caused by the broken transmission of the No. 44 Chevrolet. Thanks to the incident, Allgaier had no choice but to run with his backup car in preparation for the final race. It wasn’t just JR Motorsports’ efforts that let Allgaier run in the race. In addition to the backup car, he needed permission to run a new set of tires. Following a discussion between Wayne Auton, the series director, as well as the other Championship 4 contenders Cole Custer, Austin Hill, and AJ Allmendinger, Allgaier could practice with an extra set of tires. JR Motorsports insider Pohlman says that focusing on both cars simultaneously allowed them to make fine adjustments and get the backup up to speed quickly. “The shop guys worked on it all week long while the seven teams stayed focused on the primary car,” he explained. “There were a few parts and pieces that we transferred from the primary car, but just super proud of the effort that went into it.” Allgaier performed at a high level despite his forced starting position at the back because the team took extra care to make essential tweaks, like adding the right spring combinations and making sure every component was up to specs.     A post shared by SiriusXM NASCAR Radio (@siriusxmnascar)  Did Justin Allgaier's perseverance prove he's the most resilient driver in NASCAR today? Debate After the first run on the backup car, the team dialed in the splitter, skirt height, and car balance to closely match the original setup. Although a minor adjustment was needed to reduce tightness in the center, the car performed remarkably well. In the Championship race, drivers need every tiny bit of performance from the car. However, whenever they switch to a backup car, there is a sense of uneasiness and tension that they may carry. However, JRR planned ahead and it certainly helped Allgaier.  This was thanks to every JR Motorsports employee who “laid their hands on that car,” as Jim put it. Behind the scenes, JR Motorsports’ championship success was underscored by seamless teamwork. It proved that dedication can make all the difference. Justin Allgaier needed a backup car after crashing his primary No. 7 car into the wall during Friday’s practice session. Having to start from the back had put Allgaier at a significant disadvantage right from the start. Despite his frustration, Allgaier quickly refocused, determined to win his first NASCAR Xfinity Series championship. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Throughout the race, Justin Allgaier faced multiple obstacles. This included a tire issue near the end of Stage 2 and two separate penalties—one for a restart violation and another for speeding on pit road—that put him a lap down. Nevertheless, he didn’t give up. He chose an alternative pit strategy to get back in the race. He surged to the front in the closing laps, eventually finishing second after a nail-biting overtime. Although Riley Herbst edged him out for the race win, Allgaier’s perseverance brought JR Motorsports the 2024 Xfinity Series championship. The 2024 NASCAR Xfinity Series Championship was won by Allgaier for JR Motorsports last Saturday at Phoenix Raceway. Having been close to winning for years, this was his first championship. JR Motorsports also made history with this victory. They tied Joe Gibbs Racing for the third-most Xfinity Series titles in series history by winning their fourth. They boosted their reputation as a competitive team and their standing among top teams as well. Despite several strong seasons, JR Motorsports had never won the Xfinity Series owner championship, this was the first. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Following his first Xfinity title, Allgaier felt a wave of relief wash over him. “I’ve been doing this a long time, and these people standing around me. There’s no words. The whole Brent crew…all of our partners…what an engine this weekend. Chevrolet–it is understated what they have done. My wife and my kids, they’ve given up so much of me to do this job. God’s good … He’s got a reason for everything and tonight is truly that. It’s mind-blowing.” With this dual championship, both the driver and the owner had extra responsibility. Co-owner Kelley Earnhardt recounted the tense race to victory and expressed genuine shock at the comeback, saying at one point, “This is over for us.” JRM won thanks to Justin Allgaier’s tenacity and a well-prepared backup car. Everyone from Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Kelley Earnhardt to their crew put in years of work to win. Let the world know your perspective.

   The Denver Nuggets are looking to rebound from a disappointing second-round exit in last year’s NBA playoffs. They have started the season with a solid 7-4 record, boosted by a recent five-game winning streak that helped recover from an initial 0-2 start. The team will aim to bounce back from a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday when they head to Memphis to take on the Grizzlies on Sunday afternoon, but the team will have to go into battle without its biggest star. Senior NBA Insider Michael Scotto shared that 3-time MVP Nikola Jokic is out against the Grizzlies for personal reasons. Nikola Jokic is out (personal reasons) for tonight’s Denver Nuggets game against the Memphis Grizzlies. Jokic, a leading MVP candidate, has averaged 29.7 points, 13.7 rebounds and 11.7 assists this season. pic.twitter.com/Vk9IURTBVu — Michael Scotto (@MikeAScotto) November 17, 2024  Jokic is off to a ridiculous start. He is averaging 29.7 points, 13.7 rebounds, and 11.7 assists, and he is going to make it hard for MVP voters to succumb to voter fatigue and deny him a fourth MVP. Jokic also missed Friday’s game, which likely contributed to the Pelicans ending Denver’s five-game winning streak. Michael Porter Jr. and Christian Braun have improved this season, while Jamal Murray has seen his struggles from last postseason and the Olympics carry over into this season. It’s unclear what personal reasons Jokic is dealing with, but it has been confirmed that he and his family are fine, and he’ll likely be back soon. The Western Conference is looking as brutal as ever, and the Nuggets are still dealing with a championship hangover from two years ago. Winning championships means your role players wind up getting paid elsewhere, so making up for that lack of depth is tough, though it is a bit easier when you have a potential 4-time MVP on the roster."

   It’s Week 11, and there are still 11 teams with three wins or fewer, so plenty of heads are going to roll in the offseason as franchises look to purge themselves of those responsible for these subpar seasons. According to Jay Glazer, one team might not be ready to wait for the offseason and could make big changes in the coming days if things don’t go according to plan. During the FOX NFL pregame show, Glazer said that “all eyes right now are on the Jaguars” and mentioned that head coach Doug Pederson and general manager Trent Baalke could be axed in the coming days if the team falls flat against the Detroit Lions heading into their bye next week. ""All eyes right now on the Jaguars.""@JayGlazer breaks down the possible changes coming to the Jaguars coaching staff! pic.twitter.com/6czwJz9qT7 — FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) November 17, 2024  The Jaguars are 2-8, with 2-9 staring them right in the face due to a matchup with Mac Jones at quarterback against the 8-1 Detroit Lions on Sunday. It’s not the first time rumors have popped up about Pederson losing his job this season. The New York Jets and New Orleans Saints have already fired their coaches this season, but the Jags would be the first team to fire their general manager if Baalke is shown the door. This team has regressed considerably over the past two years and five of six games after starting 8-3 last year due to Trevor Lawrence going down with an injury, and the poor finish carried right over into the start of this season. If the Lions light it up against the Jags on Sunday, don’t be surprised if this organization decides to wipe the slate clean as soon as Monday."

Rex Ryan thinks the Bengals are the biggest threat to the Chiefs the AFC ✍️ pic.twitter.com/A7mmFrKx9O — NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) November 17, 2024  It might be true, but the Chiefs have already beaten the Bengals this season, and with Cincy currently sitting at 4-6, the likelihood of the Chiefs seeing the Bengals again is extremely slim. Burrow and the Bengals are the only AFC team to defeat the Chiefs in the playoffs aside from Tom Brady’s New England Patriots in the 2018-19 AFC Championship game during Patrick Mahomes’ first year as a starter. Ryan believes Burrow and all the talent on this offense is enough to carry a subpar defense to the playoffs and isn’t deterred by being 4-6 since they are only one game back of the 5-5 Denver Broncos for the final Wild Card spot. Burrow is having a tremendous year, and Mahomes’ numbers have been some of his worst, but somehow, the Chiefs are undefeated while the Bengals are under .500. Sometimes, football doesn’t make sense, but Ryan is correct in saying nobody will be excited if they face off against the Bengals in the playoffs."

   The Minnesota Vikings are coming off two complicated games, but they still found a way to win. That’s easier when a superstar like Justin Jefferson is running routes and deviating the defense’s attention for you. That happened again on Sunday before their road game against the Tennessee Titans, even though he hadn’t padded up yet. Jefferson made the rounds for his new outfit before the game. As the NFL on X showed, he donned a custom-made varsity-style jacket to honor Jesus Christ before the contest. .@JJettas2's fit of the week ✈️ 📺: #MINvsTEN — 1pm ET on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/HkKw7uXnxV pic.twitter.com/L4hws2kBVF — NFL (@NFL) November 17, 2024  Jefferson could make history in the game vs. the Titans. He’s 55 yards shy of logging the most receiving yards by a player in his first five seasons in NFL history, passing Torry Holt (6,784). That’s even more impressive, considering he missed almost half of the season last year. Jefferson averages north of 90 yards per game, so he’s technically on pace to do so on Sunday afternoon. Then again, the Titans will make life hard on Sam Darnold with their strong defense. Darnold hasn’t been particularly sharp over the past few weeks, especially in the close win vs. the Jacksonville Jaguars. As great a player as Jefferson is, Darnold has to be wary not to force-feed him. Having Jefferson out there will open up many things for the rest of the offense, and if they manage to take care of the football, they should win this game."

   This year’s rookie quarterback class has been exciting so far and is getting about as close as it can to living up to its hype. That includes New England Patriots QB Drake Maye, who has been impressive in his five starts since taking over the starting gig from Jacoby Brissett. Maye has injected plenty of life into a once-lifeless offense, and former Patriots legend Rob Gronkowski is a big fan of what he has seen from the team’s new franchise QB. During the FOX NFL pregame show on Sunday, Gronk had high praise for Maye and said, “I love Drake Maye. I love everything about him, especially that he had brothers growing up and he was always competing…He’s a complete leader, he’s a complete quarterback out on the football field.” ""I love Drake Maye."" 🙌@RobGronkowski and @Edelman11 are all in on Drake Maye as the starting QB for the Patriots! pic.twitter.com/xMpLSXMmMJ — FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) November 17, 2024  Gronk and fellow Pats legend Julian Edelman agreed that they loved how Maye called a team meeting recently, and Edelman said Maye has earned the right to do that already by the way he has played on the field. Maye has completed 64.7 percent of his passes for 954 yards and eight total touchdowns through five starts while adding another 233 yards on the ground. The Pats have won two of their last three games, with one loss being in overtime, so things are trending in the right direction, and Maye is looking more comfortable each week. New England takes on the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday and will look to keep the momentum going with a third win in four games."

   Caleb Williams is one of the most talented prospects in NFL history. As such, expectations were at an all-time high when he first entered the league, especially with the team’s supporting cast around him. Fast forward to today, and he has yet to live up to that hype. Of course, plenty of that isn’t on him, as his offensive line has failed to protect him, and play-calling hasn’t done him any favors. With that in mind, all eyes were on him when they spotted Tom Brady talking to him ahead of his divisional matchup with the Green Bay Packers (via Omar Ramos). What could Tom Brady be talking to Caleb Williams about ? #Bears pic.twitter.com/zOOxanOReE — Omar Ramos (@omarramoslive) November 17, 2024  Perhaps the legendary quarterback was giving him some pointers and strong advice. Brady wasn’t a high-touted prospect like Williams. He was a self-made quarterback, and while he was fortunate to reach the field, his actions with that opportunity truly set him apart from the others. Williams has all the talent in the world, and it would be a shame to see a dysfunctional organization ruin him like it’s happened to other players on other teams way too many times. The game is always better when the best play like they should, and as such, it would be interesting to hear what Williams has to say about whatever Brady told him on Sunday. More importantly, he better follow his advice fully, as he clearly knows a thing or two about playing quarterback."

Also, as great as the Ravens have been, they don’t have the best record in the league, and they might not even have the best record in their division by the end of Sunday. Whatever the case, Jackson has definitely done more than enough to merit at least being in the conversation, and with the season reaching its highest point, his performances are only going to be more impactful. There have never been doubts about Jackson’s ability to play at a high level. Then again, he has left something to be desired when it comes to stepping up in the playoffs, and he also has a history of struggles against the Pittsburgh Steelers. There will be much at stake when those two lifelong hated and divisional rivals square off on Sunday. This is a short-memory league, and there’s a big tendency to overreact. Whether Jackson helps or hurts his MVP case after Sunday’s clash against Mike Tomlin’s team remains to be seen, but that will definitely be a must-watch game."

   To say that this has been a disappointing season for the San Francisco 49ers would be an understatement. The team made it to the Super Bowl and kept most of its key players together, but injuries and a struggling defense have hindered it this season. Nevertheless, even though they are nowhere near where they want to be right now, and the No. 1 seed in the NFC might be out of the question, there’s still a light at the end of the tunnel. At least, that’s how Charles Woodson feels. Talking on FOX Sports, the legendary defensive back claimed that as much as he wouldn’t say they’re back, he thinks there’s hope for this team. ""I'm not gonna say they're back, but there's hope""@CharlesWoodson explains why he's not ready to say that the 49ers are back just yet pic.twitter.com/oDjbTfyjs5 — FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) November 17, 2024  That’s because of Christian McCaffrey’s return. Woodson is concerned about all the wear and tear McCaffrey’s body has endured over the years, not to mention the fact that he’s injury-prone. Then again, having him out there opens up way too many things for Kyle Shanahan’s offense. Deebo Samuel has struggled to be himself this season, and a lot of that has to do with his team’s lack of that dynamic Christian McCaffrey element. The Niners won’t have George Kittle for their divisional matchup with the Seattle Seahawks. But with McCaffrey back on the field, even if he’s not 100% healthy or back to his usual rhythm, the opposing defense will have to stay sharp and do a lot of guessing, so you have to like their chances in this one."

   The Detroit Lions made a big and unsurprising splash at the trade deadline by bringing in edge rusher Za’Darius Smith from the Cleveland Browns to ease the pain of losing superstar Aidan Hutchinson, who broke his leg earlier in the season and is out for the year. Hutchinson’s impact is impossible to replicate, but Smith is a perfect option to take his place. Ahead of his team debut, he made sure to dress the part on Sunday. WXYZ Detroit’s Brad Galli shared a video of Smith pulling up to the stadium wearing a Rasheed Wallace Detroit Pistons jersey. Fans can only hope he’ll play for the Lions just as Sheed did for the Pistons and lead the team to new heights by providing plenty of attitude and physicality. Za'Darius Smith wore a Rasheed Wallace Pistons jersey to his Lions debut in Detroit.  Video: @NFL / @Lions   pic.twitter.com/lYQcRrlwPQ — Brad Galli (@BradGalli) November 17, 2024  Smith has five sacks through nine games so far after posting just 5.5 total in 16 games last year and will have every opportunity to feast in Hutchinson’s role. He is also in a contract year at 32 years old, so he has a financial incentive to come to the Lions and ball out to land one last big contract in the offseason. Hutch had 7.5 sacks on the season before breaking his leg, defensive tackle Alim McNeill has 3.5, and no other Lion has more than two in the year. This team needs Smith’s services, and even though he has massive shoes to fill, this team is a well-oiled machine, and he simply has to come in and be himself."

   The Chicago Bears decided to stick with Matt Eberflus to start this season, and some analysts and fans thought it was a mistake. The team’s defense looked better in the second half of the season, but with so many new pieces on offense, not to mention a rookie quarterback, it seemed like the timing was perfect to make a regime change. That wasn’t the case, and judging by the results, the numbers, and the eye test, it may have been a mistake. Some believe that Eberflus won’t make it past this season, and other rumors state that he can even be let go at some point in the campaign. With that in mind, Adam Schefter of ESPN pointed out a somewhat worrisome trend about the Bears, their rookie signal-callers, and their head coaches. Over the past decade, the Bears have gone on to fire their head coach in the same year they used a first-round pick on a quarterback. It happened in 2017, after they drafted Mitch Trubisky second overall and then fired John Fox after that season, again in 2021 after they drafted… pic.twitter.com/xJ0zGA6SPI — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) November 17, 2024  They’ve already fired their head coach in the same year they used a first-round pick on a quarterback three times in the past decade. They did so when they fired John Fox after using their No. 2 pick to get Mitch Trubisky, and then again when they took Justin Fields at No. 11 and then fired Matt Nagy. They’ve already parted ways with offensive coordinator Shane Waldron, so they’re clearly not satisfied with the situation. Caleb Williams is too talented, and the Bears cannot afford to ruin him. He has much to learn, but the team hasn’t done him any favors. Hopefully, whoever they get, if they do get someone, will stay there for years and help him develop."

Tyson, 58, was well beaten by the 27-year-old Paul in an underwhelming contest at Arlington’s AT&T Stadium, with a staggering 65 million households tuning in to watch it unfold on Netflix. However, the streaming giants came in for heavy criticism on the night after their live broadcast continually glitched and buffered throughout the event, leaving millions of fans across the globe furious.   Former New England Patriots tight end and Fox Sports analyst Rob Gronkowski avoided those technical difficulties as he was one of the 70,000 fans in attendance at the home of the Dallas Cowboys. And before Sunday’s first round of NFL games kicked off, Fox couldn’t resist taking a dig at Netflix while discussing Gronk’s night out at the boxing. After the likes of Strahan and Curt Menefee joked that he gets ‘everywhere’, the network pulled up a clip of the Patriots legend carrying out an interview with basketball icon Shaquille O’Neal at AT&T Stadium.      Netflix has been mocked by Fox Sports’ NFL team over its Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul broadcast      The streaming giants’ live coverage of Paul’s win over Tyson was marred by technical problems      Fox Sports played a clip of Rob Gronkowski at the fight with severe buffering in a dig at Netflix Yet in a cheeky swipe at Netflix, the video then froze and buffered dramatically to mimic their broadcast of Friday’s fight. Gronk went on to mock the Cowboys after the Fox Sports panel brought up his appearance at the Tyson-Paul showdown. ‘Jake Paul has more wins at the Dallas Cowboys’ stadium this year than the Dallas Cowboys,’ he said about 3-6 Dallas. Fox NFL Sunday returned to its Los Angeles studio for Week 11, with Strahan making his first appearance on the show since last weekend’s national anthem controversy. Last Sunday, the ex-New York Giants defensive end and Super Bowl winner was on the Fox Sports panel as they broadcast from the San Diego Naval Base ahead of Veterans Day. But when the national anthem was played with a large number of military personnel standing around the crew, Strahan kept his hands in front of him instead of placing it on his chest – prompting outrage from many fans. Despite facing a barrage of calls from viewers and fans to fire him after the ‘unpatriotic’ act, DailyMail.com understands Fox Sports will not impose any sanction for what was an honest mistake. Amid the controversy, Strahan lashed out when asked by DailyMail.com for a comment on the situation on Tuesday afternoon, snatching and throwing our reporter’s phone.       Michael Strahan is back on Fox Sports after his national anthem stance (right) sparked outrage       Strahan lashed out at DailyMail.com reporter when asked for comment on the situation The following day he finally spoke out; expressing regret over his clash with the reporter outside his home, highlighting his family ties to the military and explaining why he didn’t cover his heart when the Star Spangled Banner was played. ‘Everybody it’s Michael here, and I wanna address what happened this past weekend,’ he said in a video message posted on Instagram Tuesday night. ‘I feel like I need to address it because it’s spilled over to the point where I get out of my car today and I’m ambushed by a media outlet here at my house. ‘I’m not proud of the way I handled that whole situation, but I think anybody out there can understand the things you’re gonna do. You’re gonna protect your family and you’re gonna protect your home, which I felt like I needed to do in that moment.’ Strahan went on to reveal what caused his viral national anthem blunder, admitting he was too busy admiring the US navy personnel in attendance before realizing his mistake.  ‘If you want the truth, I’ll tell you the truth… it’s that I was caught up in the moment,’ he continued. ‘I’m looking at all these young sailors standing there at attention before the national anthem played and I’m thinking to myself, “How incredible to be that young and to know that you wanna do this. It’s such a commitment but you’re willing to commit to something that gives us our freedoms.” Plain and simple.’ Your email address will not be published.

The Red Devils have been linked with a number of players since the appointment of Ruben Amorim as Erik ten Hag’s permanent replacement and they are pursuing a double swoop for the Blues pair. Chilwell has been identified as a key left wing-back target by Amorim, according to CaughtOffside, with the Portuguese tactician set to start his Man Utd reign by implementing a new 3-4-3 system.  Man Utd submit Victor Osimhen offer The 27-year-old is yet to be included in a Premier League matchday squad under Enzo Maresca this season, while his only appearance so far this campaign came during Chelsea’s 5-0 win over Barrow in the Carabao Cup back in September. The former England international was linked with an Old Trafford switch this summer and Man Utd remain interested in finalising a deal amid Tyrell Malacia and Luke Shaw’s injury woes. In addition to Chilwell, Man Utd are also looking to re-sign Benfica star Alvaro Carreras, while FootballTransfers understands that Bournemouth’s Milos Kerkez is under consideration by INEOS.  Chelsea handed NIGHTMARE Lavia blow Man Utd have been heavily linked with Chelsea forward Christopher Nkunku in recent weeks and he is also being monitored by the Red Devils hierarchy. The France international hasn’t started a Premier League match since Chelsea’s opening day defeat to Manchester City, with Nicolas Jackson preferred through the middle, and he has been touted to leave Stamford Bridge next year.

THINGS WE LEARNED from England's win over Ireland Interim boss Lee Carsley signed off in style as England capitalised on Liam Scales’ sending off in a 5-0 thrashing of the Republic of Ireland that sealed promotion back to the Nations League top tier. The 17th and final fixture of a year that saw the national team reach another European Championship final marked the end of the Under-21s coach’s six-game stint as Gareth Southgate’s stand-in. Thomas Tuchel begins his quest to win the 2026 World Cup in the new year and takes over on the back of Nations League elevation after Carsley oversaw a comfortable win against the country he represented as a player.   Mail Sport’s Sami Mokbel has assessed five things we learned from England’s Wembley defeat.       
 Big day for Chelsea here at Wembley on Sunday. Well sort of. No less than four graduates from their Cobham academy were named in the starting XI against the Republic of Ireland: Tino Livramento, Lewis Hall, Marc Guehi and Lewis Hall all came through the youth system at Stamford Bridge. Dominic Solanke, who was named on the bench, another product of Chelsea’s youth system. All five have departed the west London club for pastures new. What might have been? Jude Bellingham was booked again for dissent here at Wembley. Having seen yellow in Athens for backchat, he was dished out the same punishment here by referee Erik Lambrechts for the same offence. Bellingham is a superstar – but he needs to temper his urges to react. It will cost England dear one day. For many, Eddie Howe was the natural successor to Gareth Southgate’s vacated position as England head coach.  Howe, as we now know, stayed at Newcastle as the Football Association appointed Thomas Tuchel.  Yet it is testament to Howe’s excellent work at St James’ Park that three of his players were named in Lee Carsley’s team last night: Livramento, Hall and Anthony Gordon. Not the Geordie takeover many were expecting, perhaps. The last time three Newcastle players started for England was in 1997 when Rob Lee, Alan Shearer and David Batty played against Georgia in a 2-0 win.      
 When Lee Carsley finally meets Tuchel, you’d imagine he’ll amplify the contribution of Curtis Jones in these November fixtures.  The Liverpool midfielder looks every inch an international player. Poise, technique, athleticism and acumen.  It’s a compelling combination. Kobbie Mainoo, who missed this camp through injury, is current owner of the shirt next to first-choice midfielder Declan Rice. The Manchester United star may have some competition. Conor Gallagher will hold England’s third goal close to his heart. Not just because it was his first senior international goal – but because it was Marc Guehi who assisted it.  Off the pitch, the pair are the closest of mates having grown up up together in Chelsea’s youth system.

The superstar tight end wore a bold multicolored jacket, black pants and white trainers, with a baby blue cap and shades to complete the look. Fans are now waiting with bated breath to see if Kelce’s girlfriend Taylor Swift will follow him into the stadium, for her first road game of the year.   Swift was performing in Toronto over the past three days, and it is widely expected that she will be in attendance to watch her man and the Chiefs play on Sunday.

He scored his second touchdown of the season last time out against the Broncos, but Sunday afternoon represents the Chiefs’ toughest assignment yet. The Bills are 8-2 but improving each week, and they currently sit atop the AFC East, with their nearest rivals the 3-6 Dolphins. It is widely anticipated that this Chiefs-Bills matchup could be a taster of the AFC Championship this season, as both teams fight it out for a spot in the Super Bowl. The Chiefs have won a ring in each of the last two seasons and are trying for an unprecedented threepeat with Patrick Mahomes at QB.  Your email address will not be published.

Harwood-Bellis is engaged to the daughter of Man United legend Roy Keane, Leah ‘It’s great for him to make his debut, as I said he’s a bit of a goal threat. He’s a nice kid, his family has done a great job.’  Fortunately Harwood-Bellis and Keane have a good relationship, as the 22-year-old revealed ahead of the clash at Wembley. ‘It’s good and I take a lot of advice,’ he said of his bond with Keane.  Harwood-Bellis was with his fiancee Leah when he got the call from Lee Carsley to tell him he’d been selected. ‘I couldn’t quite believe it at first,’ he added. ‘It was a feeling of pride. I was with my partner. Then I phoned my dad and he was very proud, the fact I had played for England through the age groups and now I was in the seniors. All my family were delighted.  Football runs in the Harwood-Bellis family, and not just with the in-laws. His sister Rebecca was once a Great Britain youth basketball international.  His uncle Steve is president of their local team Stockport County while his dad used to spend matchdays as the Vernon Bear club mascot – a cuddlier dad, then, than his future father-in-law. Harwood-Bellis was a surprise inclusion in Lee Carsley’s squad for the games against Greece and Ireland, which have seen the Three Lions promoted to Nations League A.  And when the centre-back was introduced in the 62nd minute of the game, few would have expected the former U21s international to bag a rare goal.   But that he did in the 5-0 rout, evading his marker in the box before leaping and heading the ball back across goal. It was a hugely encouraging night for England in their final match under Carsley before Thomas Tuchel arrives in the New Year.  Harry Kane, Anthony Gordon, Conor Gallagher, Jarrod Bowen, and Harwood-Bellis were all on the scoresheet. All of them bar Kane from the penalty spot bagged their first goals for the national team.   Your email address will not be published.

Who played their best in a long time? And which visiting player was turned inside and out at Wembley? England sealed promotion back to the top tier of the UEFA Nations League on Sunday night by thrashing the Republic of Ireland on Sunday. The Three Lions started the night top of Group B2 due to their superior head-to-head record against Greece. But top spot remained in the balance at half-time when Lee Carsley’s England were still behind held to a 0-0 draw. However, the game changed just six minutes into the second half when Liam Scales conceded a penalty kick and earned a second yellow card all at once by fouling Jude Bellingham.   Harry Kane converted the spot-kick before Anthony Gordon and Conor Gallagher scored their first international goals to make it 3-0 before the hour-mark. Jarrod Bowen and Taylor Harwood-Bellis then bagged their first goals for the Three Lions after coming off the bench to wrap up a 5-0 win. Mail Sport’s CRAIG HOPE was on hand to provide player ratings from Wembley.       England won promotion to the top tier of the Nations League by beating Ireland on Sunday      Four England stars scored their first international goal during the demolition at Wembley   Jordan Pickford 6 Just one shot on his goal and a quiet night in which he did what he had to with no fuss. A good few days for keeper. Tino Livramento 6.5 Supplied the cross, albeit deflected, from which Gordon scored. Steady enough debut and grew in confidence, evidenced by cheeky flick late on. Kyle Walker 6 A couple of shaky moments at centre-back early on but recovered and cruised through until withdrawal after the hour. Marc Guehi 7 Was lucky to avoid penalty concession when pulling down Ferguson. Headed flick then created goal for good pal Gallagher and again did well on whole. Lewis Hall 7 A strong full debut to follow on from impressive second half in Greece. A run at left back surely awaits for Newcastle man? Composed. Curtis Jones 7 Not the dynamic showing of his debut in Greece but some nice moments and a more disciplined display. A very good introduction this week.      Atletico Madrid star Gallagher put in his best performance in a long time for England Conor Gallagher 7.5 His best in a long time for England and industry was rewarded with first international goal. Made middle of park his own as game went on. Noni Madueke 6.5 Was England’s most dangerous early on but faded. Decision-making let him down at times. Still, his corner led to third goal. Jude Bellingham 8 Was already his side’s best before two late assists to cap a display of class and composure. Must stay at No.10 now. MOM. Anthony Gordon 6.5 Still striving for better end-product and it was a frustrating night until fine finish for maiden England goal with second-half volley. Harry Kane 6 Wonderful ball leading to penalty win and subsequent conversion of it apart, the skipper again looked out of sorts. Too many poor touches. Substitutes Taylor Harewood-Bellis (on for Walker 62) 7 Morgan Rogers (on for Gordon 75) 6.5 Dominic Solanke (on for Gallagher 75) 6 Jarrod Bowen (on for Madueke 75) 7 Angel Gomes (on for Jones 79) 6 Manager: Lee Carsley 7 Signed off in style but was aided by Ireland red card after difficult first half.      Jude Bellingham was his side’s best before two assists capped a display of composure      Harry Kane again looked out of sorts and took many poor touches during the win at Wembley Caoimihin Kelleher 5 Was left exposed with his side down to 10 men and not a lot he could do about any of the five goals. Dara O’Shea 5.5 Had done OK up against Gordon first half and, even though Ireland became ragged, he stuck to his task. Mark McGuinness 5.5 Was enjoying a decent debut until sidekick Scales was dismissed and was then dragged all over as England took control. Liam Scales 4 Was doing well – one thunderous challenge on Kane – until second yellow for trip on Bellingham leading to England penalty. It cost his side. Calum O’Dowda 4.5 Used at left back and was turned inside and out by Madueke first half. Nervy in possession, too. Festy Ebosele 6 His team’s best threat and England could not knock him off ball. Helped out defensively too, most notably in doubling up on Gordon.      Liam Scales was doing well until a second yellow card lead to England’s penalty Josh Cullen 5 Some good, some bad. Unusually sloppy at times but was a robust presence when game was still alive. Was overran second half. Nathan Collins 6 Used in holding-midfield role and broke up play and protected his backline with a captain’s authority – until it all unravelled after Ireland’s red. Jayson Molumby 5 Got about England and wound up Kane before break. Disappeared along with team-mates second half. Sammie Szmodics 5 Beaten too easily before Gordon goal and did not have much of a chance to show attacking prowess here. Evan Ferguson 5.5 Could have had penalty after tangling with Guehi and tried his best despite little support. Some nice touches.      Brighton star Evan Ferguson was well marshalled by England’s defence throughout the game Substitutes Ryan Manning (on for Ebosele 67) 5 Finn Azaz (on for O’Dowda 67) 5 Troy Parrott (on foor Ferguson 67) 5 Manager: Heimir Hallgrimsson 5 Made bold call with Collins in midfield and it worked until red card ruined Ireland’s plans and hard work.

If England’s new permanent boss had bothered to turn up at Wembley for the Nations League tie against the Republic of Ireland, he would have had to sit through a masterclass by the man he has usurped. Lee Carsley, who won five of his six games as England’s interim boss, masterminded a 5-0 rout of the ten-man Irish that was a celebration of the best of our game.   Including a mesmerising spell of three goals in five second half minutes, it was a celebration of the excellence of Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane. It was a celebration of the youth players like Noni Madueke and Curtis Jones. It was a celebration of the ambition of giving two more players their England debuts – that made eight debuts in all in Carsley’s tenure. One of the debutants, Southampton’s Taylor Harwood-Bellis, scored with a towering header soon after he came on. And it was also a celebration of Carsley’s management. As one small example of his acumen, Jarrod Bowen scored 29 seconds after Carsley brought him on a substitute. With his first touch.      England won promotion to the top tier of the Nations League by beating Ireland on Sunday      Newcastle winger Anthony Gordon scored his first senior international goal during the win      Atletico Madrid midfielder Conor Gallagher also netted for the first time at international level Quite what else Carsley needed to do to get the job as Gareth Southgate’s successor full time is anybody’s guess. For many, he was the perfect candidate. But that ship has sailed. Tuchel will eventually take over at the start of next year and so perhaps it was better he was spared the embarrassment of seeing in person just what a fine job Carsley has done in his absence. Good luck beating what Carsley has achieved. Gaining promotion back to the leading group of Nations League countries was not even the half of it. Good luck recreating the spirit that Carsley has engendered. Tuchel is a fine coach but Carsley has set him a high bar. The idea that Tuchel, energised and refreshed by not watching England for a few months, is going to blow in ‘like a whirlwind’ when he starts work on January 1 is endlessly amusing. Someone might want to tell him that this is international football and that he won’t actually take charge of an England match until March. If Tuchel really is going to arrive like an angry weather front, he’s going to be somewhere over the mid-Atlantic by the time his players kick a ball in anger. England had started fast against Ireland. Madueke began where he left off against Greece, tormenting the opposition defence and creating chances. It was from a Madueke corner in the first few minutes that Kyle Walker glanced a near post header too high.      The game was still 0-0 early in the second half when Ireland defender Liam Scales was sent off      Captain Harry Kane (right) opened the scoring by converting a penalty conceded by Scales      Gordon (right) made it 2-0 in the 55th minute when he guided a low shot into the Ireland net       It was 3-0 before the hour-mark thanks to a goal from former Chelsea star Gallagher (No 4) But the game soon sunk into a dour exercise of attack versus defence. England dominated possession but could not find a way through the massed ranks of the Irish, who could not keep the ball but were able to frustrate their opposition. Even in the midst of such a game, the quality of Jude Bellingham shone through in his hunger and his relentless desire to prompt and create. Whoever wears the captain’s armband, Bellingham is fast becoming the leader of this team. England suffered a rare scare ten minutes before half time when Sammie Szmodics ran on to a long clearance from Caoimhin Kelleher. Walker dived to head it back to Jordan Pickford and seemed to bring down Szmodics as he fell but the referee waved away Irish entreaties. Highlights were few and far between. Liam Scales produced a crunching tackle on Harry Kane that fitted the all-but extinct category of ‘hard but fair’. In the dying seconds of the half, Kane hurled Jayson Molumby to the floor but even though Molumby clutched his head, Kane only made contact with his upper body. The yellow card he was shown was the correct decision. Six minutes into the second half, the game finally came alive. Kane drilled a brilliant, raking cross-field pass behind the Ireland defence into the path of Bellingham. Bellingham checked inside and was brought down by Scales, who was sent off for a second bookable offence. Kane took the penalty with a halting run-up that committed Kelleher early. Kelleher dived to his right and Kane tucked the ball away to his left. It was Kane’s 69th goal for his country in his 103rdappearance. Two minutes later, England were further ahead. Debutant Tino Livramento crossed from the right, Josh Cullen tried to clear but the ball spiralled into the air off Mark McGuinness and Anthony Gordon swept it past Kelleher on the volley. It was Gordon’s first England goal. Three minutes after that, England added a third. Madueke curled in a corner from the England right, Marc Guehi flicked it on at the near post and Conor Gallagher beat Bellingham to the touch at the far post, diverting the ball into the roof of the net.      West Ham’s Jarrod Bowen got England’s fourth goal just seconds after coming on as a sub      Man City starlet Taylor Harwood-Bellis (left) marked his England debut with a headed goal      Sunday’s big win was the last game in charge for England interim manager Lee Carsley (right) England were now brimming with confidence to the extent that Gallagher attempted a rabona in lieu of a conventional cross. It was possible to applaud the ambition while watching the ball sail into the air and land on the roof of the net. Harwood-Bellis came on for his debut midway through the half, providing another reminder of the extent to which Carsley has refreshed and restocked the England side in his six games in charge. Fifteen minutes from the end, Carsley made a rash of substitutions as England stood over an attacking free kick. Bowen was one of those who came on. He took up a position on the edge of the box and when the ball was rolled to him by Bellingham, he curled it home with his first touch of the ball. He had been on the pitch for 29 seconds. Better was to come a few minutes later. Harwood-Bellis rose majestically at the back post to meet a fine cross from the right and headed the ball down brilliantly to give Kelleher no chance. It had become a rout. When the final whistle blew, Carsley shook hands with his assistant Ashley Cole and allowed himself a smile. It was quite a way to say goodbye.

Belichick served as the team’s de facto general manager – in addition to head coach – during his 24 seasons in New England, in which he won six Super Bowls. And according to The Athletic’s Diana Russini, Belichick wants ‘as much authority as he can get’ in any future job.   That sort of control is reportedly not something many teams will be willing to grant Belichick, 72. However, a source wrote to Russini over text: ‘Coaching is in his blood; he wants this.’      Bill Belichick is reportedly seeking ‘as much authority he can get’ in his next coaching job      Belichick, seen on the Pat McAfee Show, has kept busy with various media roles this season  Belichick interviewed for the Atlanta Falcons’ head coaching job last offseason after he parted ways with the Patriots. 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan also revealed in July that he offered Belichick a defensive coordinator role on his staff.  However, ESPN’s Adam Schefter previously reported that Belichick was expected to be ‘choosy’ in picking out a potential next job. In the meantime, Belichick has been staying around football by taking on various broadcasting roles. This season, he’s regularly appeared on ESPN’s Monday Night Football ‘Manningcast’ and the Pat McAfee Show, as well as The CW’s ‘Inside the NFL.’ However his analysis has rubbed some the wrong way at times. Boston radio host Fred Toucher accused him of having a ‘vendetta’ against his former franchise after he largely attributed the Bears’ Week 10 loss to New England to their own ineptitude.  Belichick also criticized his successor, Jerod Mayo, earlier this season after he called his own players ‘soft.’ Your email address will not be published.
