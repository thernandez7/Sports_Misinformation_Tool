Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Fox News Digital Sports NFL power rankings after Week 10 of 2024 NFL season,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/fox-news-digital-sports-nfl-power-rankings-after-week-10-2024-nfl-season,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 04:00:36 -0500",The Kansas City Chiefs are still the best team in the NFL. But there&apos;s a handful of teams who can make a case as their challengers going in Week 11.,"The Kansas City Chiefs remain undefeated after blocking a last-second field goal by the Denver Broncos. Nick Wright discusses the recent victory and how it instilled confidence in the Chiefs. Can anyone stop the Kansas City Chiefs? It’s become an age-old question that NFL fans are surely getting annoyed to hear week in and week out this season. The Chiefs were nearly broken by the Denver Broncos on Sunday, but a blocked field goal sent them and the faithful at Arrowhead Stadium into jubilation. Kansas City hasn’t lost since Christmas Day last year. Since then, the team surged into first place in the AFC West, won the AFC Championship and another Super Bowl title. They’ve won every close game they’ve been in this season but might meet their match this weekend against the Buffalo Bills – just putting that out there so the ’72 Miami Dolphins could get their champagne ready. In any case, it still appears to be the Chiefs’ league and everyone else gunning for them. The Detroit Lions are likely the best team in the NFC right now, but even they were slowed by a Houston Texans team that lost to the New York Jets. Are the Baltimore Ravens or Pittsburgh Steelers viable candidates to knock off the Chiefs? Sunday could determine that or whether they’re the third-best team in the AFC North. The Chiefs hold the power again this week. Where does the rest go?

(AP Photo/Ed Zurga) The Chiefs keep finding ways to win games. This time it was the special teams coming through as Leo Chenal blocked the Broncos game-winning kick as time expired to keep the Chiefs as the NFL’s last unbeaten team. The Chiefs faced their largest deficit of the season, 11 points, but did enough to win. The Chiefs' offense had 300 yards of offense against a strong Broncos defense but struggled in the red zone, scoring just one touchdown and three field goals. The defense faltered early, giving up 14 first half points, but buckled down in the second half, shutting out the Broncos. The Chiefs will face their toughest test of the season next week when they take on the Bills on the road.

(AP Photo/Eric Christian Smith) In recent weeks, the Lions have beaten opponents while also getting better together on the field. They've grown and matured as a unit so much to the point where they feel comfortable playing from behind against a good team like Houston, and making a comeback look routine. Last week: 2 Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen (17) stiff-arms Indianapolis Colts defensive end Dayo Odeyingbo (54) during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings) The Buffalo Bills rolled past the Indianapolis Colts with an expected 30-20 win on Sunday, but the real test of their season will come this week when they take on an old foe in the imperfectly perfect Kansas City Chiefs.  Last week: 3 Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson (8) celebrates scoring a two-point conversion during the second half of an NFL football game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Thursday, Nov. 7, 2024, in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Nick Wass) They play the Steelers this week and that will help determine which team stakes a claim for postseason home-field advantage. Last week: 4 Philadelphia Eagles Jalen Hurts, left, and Saquon Barkley (26) celebrate after Hurts ran the ball for a touchdown in the second half of an NFL football game in Arlington, Texas, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024. (AP Photo/Gareth Patterson) It was a beatdown in Dallas as the Eagles came into town and wiped out their division rival, 34-6, to continue their dominance since the bye week. At 7-2, the Eagles are in clear playoff contention as the Washington Commanders’ loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers puts them atop the NFC East throne. The Eagles and Commanders face off for a highly anticipated ""Thursday Night Football"" matchup this week when they will look to make it six wins in a row. Last week: 5 Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson (3) throws during the first half of an NFL football game against the Washington Commanders, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Landover, Md. (AP Photo/Nick Wass) Russell Wilson has George Pickens playing great, Mike Williams happy he escaped the Jets and the Steelers looking like a pretty complete team.   Last week: 8 Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels is pressured by Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt (90) during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Landover, Md. (AP Photo/Nick Wass) It was a close one, but Russell Wilson and the Steelers were too much for Jayden Daniels in FedEx Field as they dropped their first game at home this season. Washington remains a top playoff contender out of the NFC, but they have a large test on Thursday night when they head to Philadelphia with the NFC East lead on the line against the Eagles. Last week: 6 Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold (14) warms up before the NFL football game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Jacksonville, Fla. (AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack) A win is a win. Minnesota had to have a game against a hapless Jaguars team and, despite looking almost as bad as Jacksonville itself at times, it got the five points it needed to stay on track. The playoff berth no one saw coming is getting closer and closer in Minnesota. Last week: 7 Green Bay Packers' Jordan Love throws during the first half of an NFL football game against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, Oct. 27, 2024, in Jacksonville, Fla. (AP Photo/John Bazemore) Their bye week came at a lucky time for the Packers. With big games against the 49ers and Bears over the next two weeks, the direction and ceiling of this Packers team will come into clearer focus. Last week: 9 San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (14) celebrates with wide receiver Jauan Jennings (15) after scoring a touchdown against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the first quarter at Raymond James Stadium. (Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images) San Francisco is getting healthy and can now work on jelling together as a complete team. With two more months till the playoffs, the Niners are right on time. Last week: 12 Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert (10) celebrates his touchdown with teammates during the first half of an NFL football game against the Tennessee Titans, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Inglewood, Calif. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) The Chargers did what good teams are supposed to do, and that is beating the teams they are supposed to beat, taking down the Titans 27-17. The Chargers have now won three games in a row and look to be playoff bound in Jim Harbaugh’s first year at the helm as head coach. Running back Gus Edwards returned from injury reserve and had 10 carries for 55 yards in the win. With Edwards in the fold and JK Dobbins having a resurgent season, look for the Chargers to lean on their newfound 1-2 punch out of the backfield. Last week: 13 Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud (7) walks off the field after an NFL football game against the Detroit Lions, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Houston. (AP Photo/Eric Christian Smith) Getting five interceptions and losing is difficult to do. The offense did not keep the foot on the gas pedal, but with Nico Collins very likely to return this week, they should be fine. They’ll have an extra day to learn what happened and then take advantage of a weak Cowboys team sans Dak Prescott. Last week: 11 Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray (1) runs for a touchdown against the New York Jets during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) Put this blurb down as an endorsement for Kyler Murray as an MVP candidate. There aren’t three players in the league having more of an impact on his team this season than Murray. Last week: 14 Atlanta Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins (18) speaks with referee Carl Cheffers (51) during the second half of an NFL football game against the New Orleans Saints, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in New Orleans. (AP Photo/Butch Dill) The Falcons suffered a brutal loss on Sunday against the Saints, which snapped a seven-game losing streak for New Orleans. The reality is that the Falcons are still the best team in the division, but the NFC South just isn’t very good. Last week: 10 Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow pauses during a news conference after an NFL football game against the Baltimore Ravens, Friday, Nov. 8, 2024, in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough) They keep saying, ""We're a good team, we're a good team."" Well, good teams string victories together and the Bengals have done that only once this season. And that was almost a month ago. Last week: 16 Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix throws during the first half of an NFL football game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Ed Zurga) The Denver Broncos offense has not exactly been prolific this season, but they have managed to win half of the 10 games they’ve played so far. The Broncos took the defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs to the brink at Arrowhead Stadium in Week 10. Rookie quarterback Bo Nix avoided making big mistakes against the Chiefs and seems to be improving every week under the guidance of head coach Sean Payton. Denver’s defense continues to be a strong point, sacking Patrick Mahomes four times this past Sunday. This week’s game against the Falcons could prove to be a measuring stick for the Broncos. Last week: 18 Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield, right, is pressured by San Francisco 49ers defensive end Leonard Floyd (56) during the first half of an NFL football game in Tampa, Fla., Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024. (AP Photo/Chris OMeara) Tampa lost, yet again, to a very good team in the 49ers, though San Francisco needed a last-second field goal to do it. The schedule has been rough, but the Bucs have to take advantage of upcoming games against the Giants, Panthers and Raiders to get back into the NFC playoff picture. Last week: 17 Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, center, is sacked by Miami Dolphins safety Jevon Holland, right, as linebacker Chop Robinson also tackles him during the second half of an NFL football game, Monday, Nov. 11, 2024, in Inglewood, Calif. (AP Photo/Jayne Kamin-Oncea) The offensive woes were on full display on Monday night, but if Sean McVay’s unit can figure that out, L.A. is still feisty enough to impact the NFC West race. Last week: 15 Seattle Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald watches from the sideline during the first half of an NFL football game against the Los Angeles Rams in Seattle, Sunday, Nov. 3, 2024. (AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson) Who are the Seahawks? Nine games into coach Mike MacDonald’s tenure, we don’t have an answer. Let’s see what this second half brings. Last week: 20 Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa passes during the first half of an NFL football game against the Los Angeles Rams, Monday, Nov. 11, 2024, in Inglewood, Calif. (AP Photo/Jayne Kamin-Oncea) Sometimes games aren’t won, they’re lost. That was mostly the case in the Dolphins' 23-15 win over the Los Angeles Rams on Monday. Miami’s playoff outlook still looks grim, but the Dolphins defense stepped up to keep the Rams touchdown-less. Last week: 24 Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams sits on the bench in the closing minutes of an NFL football game. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) Chicago looks like it has in recent years again. Losing to the Patriots pushed them further down the hierarchy and there weren't even many bright spots to pick from either in regard to rookie quarterback Caleb Williams. Last week: 19 Indianapolis Colts quarterback Joe Flacco (15) is sacked by Buffalo Bills cornerback Taron Johnson (7) during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/AJ Mast) Perhaps this weekend can be a get-right game against the pitiful New York Jets, but there’s not much to be excited about. The fourth overall pick is on the bench for the foreseeable future, yet their replacement sure looks like a typical soon-to-be 40-year-old quarterback. Last week: 22 New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers (8) walks the sidelines during the second half of an NFL football game against the Arizona Cardinals, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin) While mathematically it might still be possible, the Jets’ playoff aspirations took a tough hit this weekend with a loss to the Arizona Cardinals. While coaches and players individually want to shoulder the blame, it’s fair to point the finger across the board. Last week: 21 New Orleans Saints interim head coach Darren Rizzi walks off the field after a win over the Atlanta Falcons after an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in New Orleans. (AP Photo/Butch Dill) Well, one week after everyone said the Saints should tank to improve their draft position, they go out and beat the NFC South-leading Falcons. New Orleans predictably got that first-game-with-a-new-head-coach bump, but their problems still run much deeper than that. Last week: 29 Dallas Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy walks off the field after an NFL football game against the Philadelphia Eagles in Arlington, Texas, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeffrey McWhorter) With Dak Prescott’s hamstring surgery confirmed, he is done for the remainder of the season, and it does not look like Cowboys fans will have a ton to cheer for after Cooper Rush struggled in the 34-6 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Trey Lance ended up coming in for Rush as this game got out of hand, and Micah Parsons is causing a stir with his comments about head coach Mike McCarthy. Turmoil isn’t the word just yet in Dallas, but it’s getting close as they’ve lost four straight games. Last week: 23 New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye tosses a fan a souvenir from the team's 19-3 win over the Chicago Bears in an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Erin Hooley) Drake Maye and the Patriots’ defense earned a solid victory over the Chicago Bears – the loss shook the Bears so much they fired offensive coordinator Shane Waldron on Tuesday – and while it won’t wash away their sins from a tough first half of the season, things are looking brighter in New England. Last week: 30 Cleveland Browns quarterback Jameis Winston passes against the Los Angeles Chargers in the first half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 3, 2024, in Cleveland. (AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki) Hey, they didn't lose last week. Yes, they were on their bye. Last week: 26 Carolina Panthers running back Chuba Hubbard celebrates his touchdown with quarterback Bryce Young during the second half of an NFL football game against the New York Giants, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Munich. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) Two weeks and two wins for the Carolina Panthers, the first time in Bryce Young’s NFL career that he’s won back-to-back starts. Leave it to the Panthers to start winning after their season is already dead and now all they’re doing is hurting their draft position for 2025. Last week: 32 Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Mac Jones (10) warms up before an NFL football game against the Minnesota Vikings, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Jacksonville, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux) For some reason, their defense looked the best against the Minnesota Vikings, but even they’ve sputtered recently. Brian Thomas Jr. is a stud, but Trevor Lawrence needs to play better to get their rookie receiver to reach his full potential. Last week: 25 Tennessee Titans wide receiver Calvin Ridley, right, scores a touchdown past Los Angeles Chargers cornerback JaSir Taylor (36) during the first half of an NFL football game Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Inglewood, Calif.  (AP Photo/Gregory Bull) Just about the only good things on this team are Calvin Ridley and a halfway decent running game. The tank seems to be on for a lot of teams, and maybe Will Levis can show some flashes to convince the front office for one more year, but that’s unlikely. Last week: 28 Las Vegas Raiders head coach Antonio Pierce speaks during a news conference after an NFL football game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Sunday, Nov. 3, 2024, in Cincinnati. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) The Raiders made headlines by parting ways with offensive coordinator Luke Getsy leading up to the team’s bye week. It remains to be seen if Scott Turner will be able to get Las Vegas’ offense heading in the right direction this season. But Turner will likely employ a run-first offense, which could mean more opportunities for Zamir White. The quarterback situation continues to be unsettled, and the franchise will likely have to make a move to solidify the position in the offseason. The good news is Brock Bowers and Tre Tucker appear to be players the Raiders can build around. Last week: 31 New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones watches during the second half of an NFL football game against the Carolina Panthers, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Munich. (AP Photo/Lennart Preiss) Turmoil is the word to use in East Rutherford, New Jersey, as the Giants enter the bye week in absolute shambles. Daniel Jones might be done for the year depending on how the team’s evaluation goes during the bye, as he struggled once again and this time it came on an international stage against the league’s statistically worst defense in the Carolina Panthers. The Giants managed to get the game to overtime, but a Tyrone Tracy Jr. fumble on the first play after winning the coin toss says it all about how it’s going for Big Blue. At 2-8, the playoffs seem like a pipe dream and big questions loom over the franchise yet again as they continue to get their rebuild on the right track.

Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill played in Monday night's game against the Los Angeles Rams with what he described as a torn ligament in his wrist. The eight-time Pro Bowler was a game-time decision heading into ""Monday Night Football"" and missed some practice time recently. While Hill told ESPN he had been dealing with wrist issues since training camp, he claimed the events that transpired as he was detained by police near the Dolphins home stadium in September exacerbated the injury. Hill added that he previously underwent an MRI which confirmed a torn ligament in his wrist.

(Sam Navarro-USA TODAY Sports) Hill added that he decided to keep quiet about the injury prior to this week. But, ""that arrest messed me up,"" he told ESPN. ""[not going to] let it stop me."" Miami Police performed a traffic stop on Sept. 8, just hours before the Dolphins season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars was scheduled to kick off. Hill was on his way to the game at the time.  EX-NFL STAR CRITICAL OF TYREEK HILL FOR BEHAVIOR DURING POLICE DETENTION Bodycam footage showed police officers pulling up next to Hill’s car and telling him he was speeding. Hill asked how fast he was going but was instructed to pull over. The officer knocks on the window, and Hill tells the officer not to knock on his window like that as he hands over his driver’s license. Hill then tells the officer to give him his ticket and rolls the window back up. The officer demands that Hill keep his window down. ""Keep your window down, or I’m going to get you out of the car. As a matter of fact, get out of the car,"" the officer said. A second officer threatens to break the window. ""We’re not playing this game,"" another officer said as the bodycam footage shows one officer opening the door, reaching into Hill’s car and pulling him out with a third officer’s help. ""Hey Drew, I'm getting arrested Drew,"" Hill is heard saying, apparently speaking with his agent, Drew Rosenhaus. One officer said, ""When we tell you to do something, you do it, not what you want but when we tell you. You’re a little f---ing confused."" Tyreek Hill being taken out of his vehicle. (Miami-Dade Police Department) Hill has not put up the eye-popping statistics so far this season that fans have become accustomed to in recent years. At least some of the drop in production can be attributed to the quarterback issues the Dolphins have experienced this season. Normal starter Tua Tagovailoa missed time this year due to a concussion.  Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill, #10, catches the ball against the Los Angeles Rams in the first half at SoFi Stadium.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Canada Soccer has parted ways with Bev Priestman.  The decision to relieve Priestman of her coaching duties comes after an independent review was launched into her role in a drone surveillance scandal at this past summer's Olympics in Paris.  Assistant coach Jasmine Mander and analyst Joseph Lombardi were also relieved of duty as Canada Soccer released the findings of the investigation. The women's soccer team became embroiled in the scandal after New Zealand raised concerns about a drone flying near their practice area as the team prepared for soccer competition at the Olympic tournament.

Germany eliminated Canada from the Olympic tournament in the quarterfinals.  The investigation by attorney Sonia Regenbogen of the firm Mathews, Dinsdale & Clark found no evidence that Canadian players had viewed the drone footage.

However, it found ""potential violations"" by former Canada men’s coach John Herdman, who was not interviewed because of scheduling issues. ""Potential violations of the Canada Soccer Code of Conduct and Ethics by the former head coach of the Men’s National Team were identified,"" Canada Soccer said in a summary of the investigation.

Country music star Darius Rucker has given nearly $3,000 to the East Tennessee State Buccaneers’ Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) fund following an appearance at a football game that was deemed ""awkward"" by the singer himself. Rucker’s famous song ""Wagon Wheel"" is a staple across the country, and especially at ETSU games as they play a version of the song.  The reason is due to Rucker’s mention of Johnson City, which is where the university is located in Tennessee.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Fields were stormed throughout college football Saturday, and there was a shakeup in the rankings.  Three of the top four seeds from last week's rankings, including the No. 1 seed, still have automatic bids this week, but one squad dropped from the No. 2 seed to outside the bracket. In case you still need a refresher, five automatic bids will go to conference winners, with the top four seeds going to the top-ranked conference leaders, who will get a bye. The other seven bids go to at-large teams based on their place in the rankings. A team's playoff seeding may not be the same as its committee ranking due to the bracket system.

Boise State — Mountain West leader (8-1, 5-0); ranked 13th Georgia is ranked No. 12 in the country, but because of Boise State's automatic bid as a conference leader, the Bulldogs are the first team out, and SMU follows right behind.  The Bulldogs lost to Ole Miss last week, and the Rebels rose from No. 16 in the country to No. 11 and joined the bracket. Georgia fell from the No. 3 spot in the country. The loss was Georgia's first against a team other than Alabama since Nov. 7, 2020.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Mark Cuban runs to 'less hateful' social media platform after scrubbing X account of Harris support,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mark-cuban-social-media-platform-scrubbing-account-harris-support,"Tue, 12 Nov 2024 20:50:55 -0500",Dallas Mavericks minority owner Mark Cuban returned to the Bluesky social media platform with a post after weeks of contentious X posts.,"'America Reports' panelists Mary Katharine Ham and Matthew Bennett discuss the fallout from President Biden calling Trump supporters 'garbage' and Mark Cuban's remarks about pro-Trump women. Dallas Mavericks minority owner Mark Cuban might be looking for a fresh start on a new social media platform after a string of recent embarrassments on X.  On Tuesday, Cuban posted on the Bluesky platform for the first time in over a year.  ""Hello Less Hateful World,"" Cuban wrote.  Cuban then posted again, clarifying to followers that they shouldn't expect much political commentary from the ""Shark Tank"" host for ""a while.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM ""Just an FYI. Don’t expect any politics or speculation about what might happen for a while. I’m sure there will be plenty to comment on when the time comes,"" he wrote.  Before Tuesday, Cuban last posted on Bluesky in July 2023. His latest posts come after the platform announced it has added more than 1 million new users since last week's election. Mark Cuban of the Dallas Mavericks checks his phone during the second half of a game between the Mavericks and the Orlando Magic at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas, Nov. 3, 2024. (Jerome Miron/Imagn Images) Cuban's return to Bluesky comes just days after he deleted multiple X posts in support of Vice President Kamala Harris during the election cycle. ""I’ve always gone back and deleted tweets. For years. Same with 2020 election. 2016 election. Same with other stuff. You can use the wayback machine if you really want to see them,"" Cuban wrote on X.  Cuban's X feed had drawn a flurry of partisan debate about the recent election, and the billionaire stoked controversy by taking pro-Harris stances in debates with random users on X.  MARK CUBAN SLAMMED BY KNICKS STAR JALEN BRUNSON OVER COMMENTS ABOUT HIS PARENTS This included an exchange with former NCAA swimmer and OutKick contributor Riley Gaines in a debate over Harris' handling of the border crisis.  Gaines ended up with the last word in that debate. Cuban did not respond to Gaines' thread when she brought up that Harris' proposed border bill included funding for Ukraine and Israel and that more than 320,000 migrant children went missing while crossing the border during Harris' handling of the border.  A report from the Department of Homeland Security released Aug. 21 revealed the Biden-Harris administration had lost track of that number of migrant children who crossed the border without parents.  Cuban also took heat for comments he made during an appearance on ABC's ""The View,"" in which he claimed Trump had not been seen around ""strong"" or ""intelligent"" women.  ""Donald Trump, you never see him around strong, intelligent women. Ever,"" Cuban said. ""It’s just that simple. They're intimidating to him. He doesn't like to be challenged by them.""  Cuban was lambasted for the comments, especially by users on X, in the days after the comments and through election week. Many pointed out that one of Cuban's closest business partners as co-owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks is a woman who supports Trump.  The family of Miriam Adelson, who bought the majority of the Mavericks from Cuban in December, has donated $100 million to her Preserve America PAC backing Trump’s presidential campaign, according to Front Office Sports. It was the largest political donation of any owner in the NBA, NFL, MLB or WNBA.  Cuban's most recent X posts included a congratulatory post to Trump after his election night victory.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Congrats [Donald Trump]. You won fair and square,"" Cuban wrote on X. ""Congrats to [Elon Musk] as well.""  Since posting that, Cuban has not mentioned Trump or Harris on social media. Cuban's only post since that mentioned any political figure was on Sunday when he advertised one of his companies that specialized in supplement ratings and mentioned Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.  ""When folks like (Joe Rogan), RFK Jr. and so many others talk about wellness, that’s great. But make sure the product you use has the ingredients its label says it does,"" Cuban wrote.  Cuban was one of many left-wing figures who went so far as to suggest Trump was a ""fascist"" in the weeks leading up to Election Day.  ""Donald Trump is not a normal candidate,"" Cuban told Jonathan Karl in a recent ABC interview. ""And I think it’s not a stretch to call Donald Trump a fascist. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban poses for a photo with fans before a game against the Philadelphia 76ers Oct. 5, 2018, at the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai, China. (David Sherman/NBAE via Getty Images) ""He’s talking about ‘the enemy within’ and going after people using the military. He’s talked about mass deportations, where they’ll stop people on the street and check their papers. What does that remind you of? Talking about knocking on doors and pulling people out and deporting them, what does that remind you of? That’s pretty damn close to fascism, if not the definition of fascism."" Earlier this year, when President Biden was still the presumptive Democratic nominee, Cuban said he would vote for Biden over Trump even if Biden was ""being given his last rites."" ""If they were having his last wake, and it was him versus Trump, and he was being given last rites, I would still vote for Joe Biden,"" he told Bloomberg News in March.

(Credit: X /Bill Carl Johnson) Hurricane Milton devastated parts of Florida in October. Tropicana Field, home of the Tampa Bay Rays for 26 seasons, was damaged as the storm made landfall. While the structural integrity of the domed baseball stadium does not appear to have been compromised, its roof will have to be replaced, according to an assessment report.  The report was sent to members of the St. Petersburg City Council Tuesday and provided a potential timeline and budget for repairs. Tropicana Field is not located within Tampa's city limits. It is owned by the neighboring City of St. Petersburg. According to the damage assessment report, repairs will cost an estimated $55.7 million and could be completed prior to the start of the Rays' 2026 regular season.

It also factored in an additional $16 million in costs for design, permitting, insurance, inspections, staffing and construction contingencies. Eighteen of the ballpark’s 24 fabric panels failed Oct. 9, the report found. There was also damage to interior portions of the stadium due to rainwater and other storm-related causes. The ballpark opened in 1990 and has been the Rays’ home since they entered the league in 1998.

Tropicana Field will be demolished once the new ballpark is ready. With unforeseen costs to the city and Pinellas County from two hurricanes — vast amounts of debris removal, damage to parks and infrastructure — two of the main financial sources for the new ballpark could reconsider those plans or decide not to repair Tropicana Field at all.

""We have so much need across the city,"" council member Brandi Gabbard said at a meeting last week. ""I love the Rays. I love Tropicana Field. It’s not about not wanting to do this. It’s about a balance of priorities."" The council recently approved a $6.5 million cleanup of the ballpark to protect it from any further damage, including waterproofing areas such as the press box, seating sections and scoreboard. The city does have an insurance claim for the damage and repairs, but it includes a $22 million deductible and probably would only cover part of the overall costs. That means taxpayer money may have to be used. Tropicana Field before a game between the Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays.

USC's football program is getting a dark mark on its record in its first year in the Big 10. The program was fined $50,000 and placed on probation for one year by the NCAA because of multiple violations of coaching staff rules over two seasons, the NCAA and USC announced Tuesday, adding that they reached a settlement in the case. An NCAA investigation found that USC exceeded the allowed number of countable coaches during the 2022 season along with spring practices in 2023. Eight analysts did on- and off-field coaching during that period, exceeding the permissible number by six.

(IMAGN) Both parties also agreed that Lincoln Riley violated head coach responsibility rules but that he would not be suspended. The NCAA changed its rules restricting the number of coaches and their duties in January 2023. At the same time, head coach responsibilities were shifted from a rebuttable presumption to an automatic attachment. ""Because Riley was not personally involved in the violations and demonstrated that he promoted an atmosphere of compliance and monitored his staff, Riley rebutted his presumed responsibility for the violations occurring before the rules change. For the same reasons, the parties also agreed that a suspension penalty for Riley was not appropriate,"" the NCAA said in a news release announcing the settlement.

The remaining analysts will be restricted from practice and film review for six consecutive days during four weeks of the 2024-25 season. ""Since learning of potential violations related to our football program in May 2023, USC has worked cooperatively with the NCAA enforcement staff and with the Committee on Infractions, as we identified and acknowledged violations, issued corrective measures, and submitted a negotiated resolution in a timely fashion that was approved by the Committee,"" USC athletic director Jen Cohen said in a statement.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The New York Giants head into their bye week with a 2-8 record, tied for worst in the NFL, and lots of questions as they look to salvage the season.  Giants GM Joe Schoen spoke with reporters Tuesday to address the current state of the franchise, including quarterback Daniel Jones, who continues to struggle.  Jones has gone 3-13 in games he's started since the team signed him to a four-year, $160 million extension before the start of last season, and there are many fans saying his time as a starter should be over. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Joe Schoen, general manager of the New York Giants, speaks to reporters during the NFL Draft Combine at the Indiana Convention Center March 1, 2022, in Indianapolis. (Michael Hickey/Getty Images) Like head coach Brian Daboll, Schoen said the team will be evaluating every position as a team would during the bye week, and ""football decisions"" will be made accordingly.  But when it came to the team's struggles on offense — they are dead last in points per game (15.6), 23rd in total offense (309.7 yards per game) and 24th in passing offense (189.8 yards per game) — Schoen didn't single out Jones despite his poor play.  GIANTS COACH BRIAN DABOLL NONCOMMITTAL ON DANIEL JONES AS QUARTERBACK MOVING FORWARD ""Yeah, in general, it’s not just — I understand the question and you want to pull him out, but it’s everybody,"" Schoen explained. ""Everybody’s got a hand in this. I know being the quarterback and the offensive coordinator, head coach, people like to point to those guys in general. Daniel’s played some good games, and there are some games where he would look to have some throws back or do things differently. But, in general, it’s not one individual or one situation that keeps occurring, unfortunately.  ""We’re 2-8. everybody needs to, including myself, look in the mirror and [see] how can we do things better, and, again, that’s what we are going to continue to do. I understand you guys want to ask about Daniel, and it’s the quarterback position. That’s what comes with the territory, specifically in this market. Again, it’s not all on one person."" The Giants' defense, on the other hand, has struggled to stop the run game. But it is 17th in total yards allowed per game and 15th in points allowed per game.  Schoen mentioned the Giants being 1-5 in one-score games this season and spoke about the team needing to execute in those crucial moments to turn losses into wins.  New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones passes the ball against the Washington Commanders during the third quarter of a game Nov. 3, 2024, in East Rutherford, N.J.  (AP Photo/John Munson) However, the Giants had a clear chance to do so in Germany Sunday against the Carolina Panthers, the team with the worst defense statistically this year. Instead of capitalizing on key red zone trips, Jones threw two interceptions, one of which was a pass that hit off the helmet of an incoming Jadeveon Clowney and the other thrown behind Tyrone Tracy Jr., who couldn't haul it in.  There were also key misses from Jones, including wide open receivers on a controversial flea flicker on a third and 1 that had Daboll incensed on the sideline after Jones took a sack.  PANTHERS TOP GIANTS IN NAIL-BITER AS CALAMITY OF ERRORS DOOMS NEW YORK The Giants have yet to bench Jones this season, other than during a blowout loss against the Philadelphia Eagles to keep him healthy. Yet, critics can argue Jones should have been benched in previous games in favor of backup Drew Lock.  Schoen, who said he intends to return as the team's GM next season, has a big decision looming with an opt-out in Jones' contract ready to be exercised after the 2024 campaign is complete. He hasn't shown the franchise anything good since getting that extension after a career year in 2022, and it would cost just over $22 million in dead cap money to get out of the deal.  It's also worth noting Jones has a $23 million injury guarantee in the deal, meaning if he fails a physical in March, he is due that amount anyway.

There, Clark said, fans tossed her so many friendship bracelets that when she put them all on, it cut off her blood circulation.  ""I had a ton, all the way up the arm. I had to take them off.

However, the starting price plummeted in the days leading up to the concert to just $1,271 before fees by Friday morning on Vivid Seats.  Clark's WNBA salary for 2024 was $76,535. However, she is estimated to have made much more from other revenue sources. Clark was recently pictured next to Swift on the cover of Time magazine's recent Inspiring Women special edition issue that featured eight women in positions of leadership, including multiple athletes.

Watch episodes of 'God. Family. Football.' on Fox Nation. Louisiana governor Jeff Landry gave a hand in convincing LSU to bring out a live tiger for its game against Alabama this past weekend, and doubled down on his initiative after the team lost 42-13. It was intended to revive the program's tradition of having a live tiger, named ""Mike the Tiger,"" appear at games. The decision to have the live tiger brought forth controversy and criticism, but Landry dismissed those criticisms during a speech Monday night in Metairie at an event known as ""Politics with a Punch."" ""I had more people come up to me, and they remembered Mike the Tiger more than some of the great plays in Tiger Stadium,"" Landry said, via CBS Sports. ""And they grew up as children seeing this.

The university previously had a live tiger at games but discontinued the tradition in 2015 amid controversy over the treatment of the endangered species. The most recent animal to appear at games with the famed mascot name ""Mike the Tiger"" died in 2016. He was the sixth in his line, known as Mike VI. ""I’m going to tell you something. This is about tradition. And the thing about tradition is about respecting those who came before you,"" The university keeps its current live tiger mascot named Mike VII in a 15,000-square-foot enclosure on campus. A different tiger, named Omar Bradley, was shipped over from Florida's Worldwide Exotic Animal Talent Agency to appear at Saturday's game.

I’m sorry,"" Landry said.  Landry said earlier this year that he wished to see a live tiger back on the sideline in Death Valley, and this move could be due to that wish.

Sports Collectors Daily,Morehouse to Auction House: Exceptionally Rare Babe Ruth Rookie Card Heading to REA,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/morehouse-to-auction-house-exceptionally-rare-babe-ruth-rookie-card-heading-to-rea/,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 03:33:38 +0000","A serendipitous meeting at a garage sale led to a find of incredible vintage baseball cards, including two never before seen Morehouse Baking Babe Ruth rookie cards.","November 12, 2024 By PJ Kinsella  After more than three decades in the healthcare industry, Jeff Gross is more than a little accustomed to surrounding himself with people committed to helping others. After a chance encounter while working at a family garage sale, he found himself taking on the role of helper in the most unlikely of ways. Growing up outside of Boston, Gross was exposed to sports and their rich history from a very young age. A die-hard sports fan to this day, he can be described as a fan of all things baseball. In his basement is a personal sanctuary created as a tribute to the game he loves, complete with a 5-foot long and 3-foot high black-and-white Temple Cup reproduction print on one wall. Visitors can sit and take in the scene on a modern day leather lounge chair on one side or an original Fenway Park stadium seat on the other. In between are shelves and cabinets full of collectibles depicting Boston legends, baseball greats, and his own children and nephew on homemade trading cards memorializing their time on the diamond growing up in Newburyport, Massachusetts. If you get an invitation to visit Gross’ shrine, you’ll also have to open a pack of cards from his miniature store-like display tucked in the corner. On the day we visited, the packs up for grabs were 1989 Fleer. Would there be a Billy Ripken error card inside? He looked on with a palpable sense of excitement – part curiosity, part joy, but all exuding an obvious passion for the sport, the collectibles, and the desire to share with others. The passion is something that Gross is very proud of and cannot – does not – want to contain. If an opportunity comes up to talk about sports, he’s going to take it, and if an opportunity arises to talk about baseball cards – a hobby he’s enjoyed for more than five decades – he’s all in. Sitting in the driveway of a family member’s house late last year, he got the opportunity to do both when a gentleman biked up the driveway to inspect items that had been neatly displayed for a garage sale.  The gentleman on the bike – we’ll call him “John” for easy reference – was out that day on a combination of exercise and treasure hunting. But as all involved would come to learn, it was in his own home that a massive treasure lurked. As he perused the sale, John struck up a conversation with Gross. It quickly turned to sports, then collecting, and then baseball cards before John mentioned a small box of old baseball cards that his dad had passed along to him. As Gross recalls, once John “started talking about his old baseball card collection, it immediately caught my attention.” John biked home to pick up a few sample cards, which included T206 commons. Knowing the cards were from the 1910-era, Gross encouraged him to spend some time inventorying the cards and offered his assistance in the endeavor. They exchanged information, but a few months passed before the conversation picked back up again. John was never a big collector himself, tallying only a couple dozen cards in his youth, mostly of his favorite players, Carl Yastrzemski and Tony Conigliaro. He also accumulated a few members of the Dallas Cowboys, who were on television far more frequently than the hometown Boston Patriots of the 1960s. He was raised in a family that did house buyouts as a part-time job, buying furniture and antiques to sell in the Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts. Over the years, his parents accumulated a large collection of antiques that lived in the basement of their house for many years throughout John’s life. “Even my mother was really good at pinpointing the value of an antique,” John recalls. The opportunity to prepare an inventory was the first time John spent any meaningful time with the cards. He remembers seeing the card collection in a box among the antiques but never learned where they came from or exactly when his father got them. “My father was planning to sell the cards as well as the antiques to help pay for retirement, but he just never got around to doing anything with the baseball cards.” His father did, however, keep somewhat of a rolling checklist of the cards as John found price guide pages for the T206 set with checkmarks next to most of the players’ names. As John would come to find out, the collection included hundreds of tobacco, caramel, and other cards issued during the 1910s and 1920s as well as some newer cards from the 1940s and 1950s. After reconnecting with Gross, the two made arrangements to get together to review John’s inventory and some more of the cards in person. John’s detailed spreadsheet contained tabs broken down by set. Gross gravitated towards some of the more well-known sets – would there be a Wagner listed on the T206 page, he wondered. Some great names from baseball’s past jumped out to him – there was Mathewson and Cobb as well as Lajoie and Comiskey. It wasn’t until he saw a tab labeled Morehouse Baking that he really stopped in his tracks. “I recognized many Hall of Famers on the list for this set, but the Morehouse name didn’t immediately register with me,” Gross remembered. “The images of the cards I had seen many times before, and I was familiar with the Sporting News version, but I had never seen a Morehouse card in person.”  He was definitely not alone. While some vintage enthusiasts would be familiar with the M101-4/5 series, even many seasoned collectors would not have recognized the Morehouse Baking name and for good reason. Fewer than 90 examples from this obscure bakery have ever been authenticated by PSA or SGC, and only a small fraction of those cards have ever been offered for auction. Since 2003, REA has only sold six. Determined to learn more, Gross set off on a research quest, not only to boost his own knowledge and understanding but to better help John understand exactly what he had and its potential value. In 1916, Chicago-area publisher Felix Mendelsohn designed and distributed a 200-card set of baseball cards distinguished from other sets of the era by crisp black-and-white, real-photo images. Virtually all the stars of the day were featured within the set, including Boston Red Sox rookie pitcher Babe Ruth. Originally issued with blank backs, the cards were made available to various other companies throughout the country to use and remarket with their own advertising on the reverse. Most notably, The Sporting News capitalized on this opportunity, marking cards with advertising for “The Baseball Paper of the World.” In total, eighteen different companies are known to have used cards in their own promotions and printed advertisements on the backs of these cards. Nestled in Lawrence, Massachusetts, the Morehouse Baking Company was one of those advertisers that saw partnering its products with baseball cards as a way to drive sales. The city of Lawrence was, at that time, bustling with production. With a population of nearly 100,000 people, its strategic location along the Merrimack River made it an ideal location for manufacturers, mills, and trade that relied on movement along its 117-mile length from the Atlantic Ocean through northern Massachusetts and into New Hampshire. It had developed a reputation as one of the world’s leading textile hubs, and its city streets were dotted with brick factories and smokestacks signaling a robust level of activity as a cog in the larger wheel of early 20th century commerce. The decision was made to promote the bakery’s Sunlight Bread. For ten cents, a fresh loaf would be sold with a baseball card inside. To further incentivize the area youth to demand the Sunlight Bread from their parents, the company devised a promotional giveaway that promised one of two items sure to appeal to any kid in 1916 – a jump rope or a baseball and bat. Once you acquired fifty cards, you could present them at the company’s office, located at 7 Mill Street in Lawrence, and claim your prize. As an added bonus, you’d keep the cards as well, but not before the company marked them as redeemed to prevent any enterprising kids from double-dipping on the offer.  Today’s baseball card hobbyists most closely associate the cards produced by Felix Mendelsohn with The Sporting News based on the large supply of those cards in the marketplace. There is a hierarchy of scarcity among the advertising backs, though, thanks to research by collectors Todd Schultz and Tim Newcombe. Based on their 2017 analysis, Morehouse Baking ranked 13th of 18, ahead of noted rarities, such as Mall Theatre, Burgess-Nash, Successful Farming, and Holmes to Homes. Other advertisers can be found with varying degrees of success, including Famous & Barr, Block & Kuhl, Altoona Tribune, and Green-Joyce. Armed with all this information, Gross was excited to share his findings with John. What they both knew was an exciting collection was now much more significant – not only in terms of value but also in terms of what it represented to the hobby. With more than 100 Morehouse Baking cards accounted for in John’s shoebox, there would be dozens of cards that the hobby would see for the very first time. The two men, now bonded by century-old bakery cards, sat down to review the information. There was, however, a twist. As detailed as John’s inventory was, he’d only inventoried the cards that were at his house. He’d omitted some cards that were displayed in his office, and he wanted to update the list before they got started. They were cards of players who he recognized – Tinkers, Evers, Chance, Thorpe, Jackson, and Ruth. Two Ruths, in fact.  “Don’t worry, we had good security,” John joked. It was at that moment that Gross, already excited by what he’d learned in the course of his research, was blown away. He knew that John was considering selling the cards, but now it was bigger than either of them could have imagined. There needed to be a plan.  Navigating this unprecedented collection would take even more time and research than had already been invested. The questions swirled. What could it all be worth? What’s the best way to sell them and where?  Who can we trust? Many of these questions came from John, but he wasn’t sure if he knew the best way to answer them or if he had the time to make sure he left no stone unturned. The world of baseball cards was far removed from his day to day experiences, and he was never much of a collector himself. He decided that Gross would be best positioned to assist him in this endeavor. They’d built a great rapport in a relatively short period of time and agreed that Gross would serve as John’s de facto agent and deliver to him proposals about how to best position the collection for sale. Weeks of research about the selling side of the hobby ensued. “I am 2% seller and 98% collector in my own collecting,” Gross said. He’d participated in a number of online auctions as he built his own collection but never consigned. As he voraciously consumed all the information he could find about auctions online through social media, message boards, and company websites, he decided that he had to take the research into the real world. He booked a trip to Cleveland for the 2024 National Sports Collectors Convention. He’d spend a few days walking the convention floor, meeting with collectors, dealers, and auctioneers. Full immersion was the goal. The convention was, as it is for many, sensory overload. Hundreds of tables, tens of thousands of people, and not enough time in the day to see everything. But the mission was clear, and Gross hit the ground running. It was easy enough for him to strike up a conversation, and he went to numerous tables to pick the brains of those set up behind them. He had some pictures on his phone that, if the conversation went well enough, he’d break out to show he was serious. When he arrived at the Robert Edward Auctions booth, he started chatting with a sales representative and ultimately shared some pictures of John’s tobacco cards and 1940s Hall of Famers. A short time later, company president Brian Dwyer overheard the conversation and introduced himself. The two got to talking and eventually the Morehouse Baking cards came up. For Dwyer, who has decades of experience in the area of vintage baseball, they registered immediately. “I knew very quickly that there was something special here,” he said. “I’ve handled numerous Babe Ruth rookie cards from the M101-4/5 series over the years, and I didn’t recall ever hearing about – let alone seeing – a Morehouse Baking Ruth.” After nearly an hour of chatting, Gross continued his exploration around the convention, vowing to stay in touch with REA, just as John did with him months earlier. When he returned to Massachusetts, there was a greater level of information to share with John. “I went back and broke out my white board like I do with other deals at work.” The two men meticulously outlined the prospective sale from every angle. There were follow up calls with REA and the other auction houses Gross visited. In the end, they chose to work with REA. “Everything went great with Brian. He was knowledgeable, trustworthy, and felt very well-informed.” A short time later, Dwyer, Gross and John met in Lawrence, Massachusetts, home of the Morehouse Baking Company, to finalize the consignment of the collection to REA. “I can’t think of another consignment where I’ve been able to go back to square one like that,” Dwyer recalled. “It was incredibly special to stand at the base of the Morehouse factory with these monumental cards.” In total, 119 cards featuring the Morehouse Baking advertisement are featured within the collection, representing more than half of a complete set. This makes the collection the single largest assembly of Morehouse Baking cards in the hobby and the most sizable group ever to be available at auction. Twenty-four Hall of Famers highlight the collection, including two examples of the #151 Babe Ruth, which are the first confirmed examples of this iconic Ruth card featuring this advertisement. Also included are several noteworthy members of the 1919 Chicago “Black Sox,” including Joe Jackson, Buck Weaver, and Hap Felsch, as well as a card of the legendary Jim Thorpe. PSA has graded several of the cards from the collection. One Babe Ruth grades VG+ 3.5, making it one of the highest-graded Babe Ruth rookies to feature an advertising back ever offered. The Joe Jackson, which is also the first example authenticated by any grading company, grades GOOD+ 2.5.  Notably, every card in this collection is stamped “Cancelled” on the reverse, signaling that they were, at one time, presented to the company in exchange for the listed prizes. Whether these cards were kept together by someone at the Morehouse Bakery or if they stayed together from a single collector, who must have enjoyed them alongside both the jump rope and baseball bat and ball, has been lost to time. It’s a fun question to ponder, and both Gross and John have envisioned a Lawrence-area kid running around in 1916 trying to get all these cards.  Now, with the collection slated for REA’s Fall Auction in November (duplicates and the second Ruth rookie will run in the company’s Spring Catalog Auction in April), they envision collectors will share the same enthusiasm for this special group of cards. “It wasn’t until my chance meeting with Jeff that I truly realized the collection’s real value,” said John. For Jeff, that chance encounter has changed the trajectory of his hobby pursuits. As a full-time business advisor in the healthcare industry, he’s called upon frequently to size up situations and offer his best advice. He believes there’s a place for him to leverage his hobby and business experiences and has launched JeffGrossVintageBaseball.com to help people like John with their collections as they consider their next moves. While this collection is the first that he’s worked on in such a capacity, it’s provided him with exciting experience already that he’s looking forward to applying with future clients. In a story filled with chance encounters and notable firsts, there’s one more that cannot go unmentioned. While John was inventorying his collection, he found a copy of the 2001 Standard Catalog of Baseball Cards among his father’s possessions. Inside was a newspaper ad for REA from 1994, pulled from an antiques publication and used as a bookmark. The ad featured an image of Babe Ruth. Now, 30 years later, it’s John’s own headline making Babe Ruth card that will come to auction and may well appear in the company’s ads for years to come. Who says you can’t be romantic about baseball…and baseball cards? A lifelong collector with 15 years of marketing and public relations experience, PJ Kinsella oversees all communications initiatives at Robert Edward Auctions.  Prior to joining REA in November 2022, he spent 11 years in the fintech and capital markets sector where he worked with an array of companies.
He graduated from Seton Hall University cum laude in 2008 with a B.S. in Business Administration and a focus in Marketing and Sports Management.  He lives in Middletown, New Jersey with his wife Danielle and his border collie mix Eddie.

Sports Collectors Daily,Hobby Up Arrows Part IV: NHL Pacific Division Break Out Stars,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/hobby-up-arrows-part-iv-nhl-pacific-division-break-out-stars/,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 02:28:52 +0000","In the final installment of our NHL division-by-division series, we look at the breakout stars for 2024-25 and their Young Guns rookie cards.","November 12, 2024 By Jeff Morris  While Macklin Celebrini highlights a strong crop of rookies in the NHL Pacific Division, there are also several players on the west coast who are ready to step into the hobby limelight with a breakthrough 2024-25 season. Here is Part IV in our four-part look at this season’s potential NHL break out stars and their Upper Deck Young Guns cards. 2023-24 Upper Deck Series 2 Young Guns #468  If you ever bought into the cliché that no one remembers who was picked number two, it won’t apply here. Leo Carlsson, who was picked second in the 2023 NHL Draft after Connor Bedard went first, is expected to become the franchise player in Anaheim. After 14 games he had seven points, good for second on the team in scoring, but expect his numbers to improve as the season goes on and he gets more comfortable in his role with the team. Brandt Clarke 2022-23 Upper Deck Young Guns Series 2 RC #470  Early in the season, we made a bold prediction that 21-year-old defenceman Brandt Clarke would be the breakout player of the year. We will revise that prediction to say that he will be a Norris Trophy finalist before we have to endure another U.S. election. Full disclosure, we have been watching this kid play since he was an 11-year-old in the Nepean Minor Hockey Association. Clarke is an offensive defenseman who had a nine-game audition with the Kings at the beginning of the 2022-23 season. By the way if you are wondering why so many draft picks play nine games before being sent back down, that is the maximum number of NHL games you can play before burning a contract year. After his audition, he went to play with Connor Bedard and Team Canada at the World Juniors. If Bedard was Bat-Man, Clarke was Robin in the series as they backboned Canada’s gold medal. But here is what was Bobby Orr-like. Clarke went back to the Ontario Hockey League to finish his junior career with the Barrie Colts. In 31 games – remember that he is a defenceman – Clarke had 23 goals and 38 assists for 61 points. After 16 games, Clarke is tied for fifth among NHL defencemen with 13 points. He will soon be mentioned in the same sentence as Cale Makar and Quinn Hughes. Pavel Dorofeyev 2021-22 Upper Deck Series 2 Young Guns RC #496  The 24-year-old Russian left winger had 24 points in 47 games with the Golden Knights despite playing only 13 minutes a game last season. He came into this season slated to play with mark Stone and William Karlsson, which would give him a lot more of an opportunity to contribute offensively. Dorofeyev has responded with eight goals in the first 14 games of the season. He had 13 goals all of last year. Among NHL forwards, he will be one of the top breakout non-rookies this season. 2023-24 Upper Deck Series 1 Young Guns RC #210  I wrote about Dustin Wolf rookie cards over the summer. Over the past three seasons, he has been the American Hockey League’s most dominant goalie. He played one game in 2022-23 and then 17 last season while spending most of his time with the AHL Calgary Wranglers. Wolf was NHL ready, but there was no room for him with the Flames. With Jakub Markstrom no longer in Calgary, Wolf is splitting time with Daniel Vladar and is off to a good start. In his first eight starts, Wolf had five wins and a .913 save percentage. He narrowly missed his first shutout Monday night. There have always been questions about Wolf’s size, which was why he was drafted in the seventh round of the 2019 NHL Draft despite having an incredible 2018-19 season as a junior with the Everett Silvertips. Wolf is 6’, 166 pounds, but if you can stop the puck, you can stop the puck. And in case you are wondering about Vladar, he is another one to watch. He was originally drafted by the Boston Bruins and his rookie card is in the 2018-19 Upper Deck Series 2 release as card #493. 2023-24 Upper Deck Series 2 Young Guns RC #496  Zary is not ever gong to contend for an Art Ross Trophy as the NHL scoring leader, but he is one of those gritty, 200-foot players who will contribute offensively while playing above his 6’, 180-pound size. He was called up to the Flames early last season to fill in for an injury, and he made it impossible for them to send him back to the NHL. He scored 14 goals last season, and look for him to improve on his 34 points. Zary was third on the team in scoring with eight points as of Monday, but with Anthony Mantha now out with an injury, look for Zary to shoulder more of an offensve role. In the hobby, he is going to be a player with a huge demand in his local market. Jeff Morris is a hobby veteran who has been a collector for more than 50 years. Originally a hobby journalist, he became brand manager at Pinnacle, and then was an executive for Collector's Edge and Shop at Home before joining Pacific Trading Cards as VP of Marketing.

We took this week off from the show and last week from writing. But last week on the show, SC Daily editor Rich Mueller joined Drew in Collectors Corner to talk about the Year Of Ohtani, those crazy card grading numbers and more. Troy Rutter returns to talk hobby news, upcoming shows, and our TTM successes. You can listen to the show here. TTM Successes
Paul Coffey  Typically I recommend against sending out autograph requests to teams late in a season and into the playoffs. But when I saw Coffey was an assistant bench boss for the Edmonton Oilers, I hurried to drop one in the box during June’s Stanley Cup Finals. The Hall of Fame defenseman signed this trio: a 1988-89 Topps set addition, a card from Sweden’s Semic Globe VM ’95 set, and a promo from the 1991 National Candy Wholesalers of America Summer Convention. The request went to the Edmonton Oilers, and took about four months. Dan Hampton  At this point, it’s tough to get any more free or cheap hits in the football sets I’m doing. I’m halfway through the 2004 Topps All-Time Fan Favorites cards and everyone that I don’t have either doesn’t sign, charges more than I’m willing to pay, or is deceased. In the 1991 Pro Set art cards (All-Pros, Hall of Famers, and Legends), I’m at pretty much the same spot. Fortunately I saw that Hall of Famer Dan Hampton– an on-again off-again signer– was on again, so I hurried to get this out before the success window closed. He got it back to me via his Indiana home in a week and a half. The Old Graphs Home
Before the advent of easy internet searches, it could be tough finding retired players. Aside from the Jack Smalling book and Meiselman lists, the average collector didn’t have the tools easily at hand to find where their favorite ex-players had settled in retirement. I started in the autograph hobby right at the dawn of the ubiquitous internet: the late 90s and early 2000s, when most of our internet time was spent cracking up at Hamster Dance and flying toasters and we all knew and used the phrase “Hello World!” on our pages. Information in general was easier to come by, the those specific addresses were still few and far between. Enter the Alumni Association. Many teams in all sports would accept mail and forward it to their former players if they had an address on file for them. The Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto simply required a $5 fee to send your mail onward to any of its inductees. When I first started in hockey mailing, I used that to my advantage– but not as much as I wish I had now in hindsight. Back then, I got Gordie and Mark Howe for free via the Red Wings, as well as Maurice and Henri Richard, plus Guy Lafleur all via the Canadiens. Both teams’ alumni operations went through the standard team address, making it very easy to send off. In today’s internet, we have perhaps hundreds of methods for finding addresses. From SportsCollectors.net to Star Tiger to even just getting your hands dirty and doing it all yourself via White Pages online, almost anyone in America is accessible via the mail for better or worse. Most players are listed on those aforementioned sites. But once in a while, it’s still tough. You may be struggling to find a current address, perhaps due to the player moving overseas, or having an unlisted address. The good news is there are still some teams who send mail to their alumni. Fair warning: I have not widely tested these out recently. But if you’re truly stumped on finding a former player, you should consider mailing off to their best-known team and see what happens. At the very least in the NHL, a number of teams have proven willing to forward onward to players at least once in a while. I mentioned the Canadiens before, and they have come through for me in the recent past in addition to those original three that I mentioned off the top. I’ve seen more recent successes from other collectors as well, so if you have some Habs you need, they are worth a shot. Of course, their southward rivals the Boston Bruins couldn’t let themselves be beaten out either: I have seen several successes from their alumni association as well. Out west, Vancouver has been excellent about staying in contact with ex-players, as Stan Smyl and Orland Kurtenbach signed for me through the Canucks’ Alumni. I’ve also heard of the Flyers, Sabres, and Senators sending mail on if they have addresses on file. Years ago, the late Bobby Hull was an excellent signer via the Blackhawks, and I saw successes from Dave Semenko via the Oilers well after he had retired. Dale Hunter is more easily accessible through the London Knights, but if you are out of Canadian stamps, I have seen some via the Washington Capitals as well. Look for team alumni associations online and see who their members are. I know the Dallas Stars’ Alumni Association had a very active site recently that listed everyone that is a member. While I haven’t TTMed any of them, I have often seen them in-person at a variety of events from pregame signings to alumni charity games. Bob Bassen is in charge there and even if there’s a former Star you need who isn’t a member, reach out to him. Maybe he’ll have a lead. The Capitals also have an alumni association roster: I bet if you need any of them, they might sign through the team’s address. I haven’t ventured too deeply into other sports, but it’s worth a try. The Texas Rangers’ Alumni Legacy Program has been active at games throughout the years: they may be able to forward mail onward as well; I know the Reds, Guardians, and Braves often have former players in for their winter fan fest events, so I’d bet their alumni associations are quite active as well. So if you’re struggling to track down a former player, mail off to their team’s Alumni Association. The worst that can happen is you’ll be out a few cards and stamps.

The new release calendar offers a quick roundup of major manufacturers’ products that are coming to your local hobby shop, dealer or online retail outlet. 2024 Topps Chrome Update  The chase for 2024 MLB Debut Patches is on with Update, but there’s a pretty nice crop of base rookies here, too.  There will be plenty of Jackson Merrill, Paul Skenes, Jackson Chourio, Elly De La Cruz, etc. throughout the base set and inserts (see the downloadable checklist below). The base set will consist of 200 cards on chromium stock with a checklist of players from the regular Topps Update set. There are multiple box formats to choose from here, including Hobby, Jumbo and Fanatics exclusive Mega formats with exclusive content. Hobby boxes contain 24 packs with four cards per pack and one autographed card guaranteed. Breaker boxes will have two autos and Jumbos will hold three signed cards. You can check current pricing on eBay here. Fanatics Mega boxes offer 28 cards in all at $49.99. 2024 Topps Chrome Update checklist 2024 Panini Impeccable Baseball  Impeccable has been a Panini staple in basketball and football but adds baseball this year, with a release that includes autographs from prospects to former greats. If you like to pull autographs and aren’t fussy about MLB licensing, Impeccable may have some appeal.  A typical nine-card box will have five autographed cards and Panini is touting the prevalence of on-card signatures.  The cheapest price we found was $475 per box but you can track prices up to the minute here. Also set for release on 11/13:  2024 Topps UEFA Chrome Euro Soccer, 2022-23 Upper Deck Premier Hockey 2024 Topps Holiday Baseball  Candy canes and other shenanigans are back with Topps Holiday.   Sold in the Mega box format, each contains ten packs with boxes guaranteeing a relic, autograph or autographed relic, along with two image variation base cards, five ‘Glitter’ parallels and one Blue Metallic Glitter parallel.    Again, the strong 2024 rookie card class is a strong driver here, even if the content is not super serious and the autographs are rare. Boxes should be available via your local big box store that normally carries cards but you can find them via Fanatics for $29.99. Collectors seem to like the fun for the price and the rookie crop doesn’t hurt. 2023-24 Upper Deck Engrained Hockey  Engrained has been on the bench for a few years but makes its return with this product, which is dated to last season and that means Connor Bedard rookie cards. It’s a single six-pack box with at least one card numbered to 49 or less.  Look for multiple hits, though, including at least one autograph, maybe two.  To make up for lost time, the 200-card base set consists of 65 star veterans (#’d to 349), 35 legends (#’d to 299) and 100 top rookies from three different seasons: 2023-24 (65 #’d to 399), 2022-23 (25 #’d to 299) and 2021-22 (10 #’d to 299). The cards for each rookie class sport a different design, and the 2021-22 rookie cards will be randomly seeded into boxes as a bonus seventh card Boxes are selling for around $500 now. 2024 Topps Gilded Collection Baseball  Classy, gold-hued Gilded returns for the third straight year.  Boxes feature one framed autograph or framed cut signature card plus three Chrome base or parallel cards and a Chrome Gold autograph card, along with three numbered base or insert cards.     Gold Storm super short prints will be among the big chases, with each numbered to 24.   When they drop, you can expect boxes to run about $600. 2024 Topps Chrome F1  Topps continues its deal with Formula 1 with Chrome, the annual release that’s similar to its MLB cousin. The 200-card base set has drivers from F1, like Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton along with  F2 and F3 prospects, race cars and other content. There are Legends cards this year and a massive number of base card parallels. Autographs are possible, but not guaranteed in Hobby boxes, which have 12 packs and eight cards to a pack. There’s also a ‘Qualifying Lap’ product with 16 packs, but only four cards in each.  Boxes are available now on eBay.

Now the quaint, handwritten creation he turned during an English III class at UCLA in 1940 is about to go up for sale. Weiss Auctions is offering the 15-page report—all in Robinson’s hand and complete with pictures he pasted to illustrate his conclusions—in its Fall Auction. The one-of-a-kind piece is expected to sell for $15,000-$25,000.  According to the auction company, the report was purchased years ago from the estate of long-time UCLA assistant football coach A.J. Sturzenegger and comes with a JSA Letter of Authenticity. It’s believed to be the first time it’s been offered publicly. “We are very excited to be able to handle a terrific item like this,” Weiss Auctions Founder Phil Weiss told SC Daily. ” In over 40 years in the auction business, we’ve had the opportunity to handle the sale of some very unique and significant items and this definitely would be near the top of that list.”  The auction cuts a wide swath across sports and non-sports card categories.  Collectors of pre-War vintage cards will find a group of rare 1932 US Caramel card, including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, 1933 Goudey issues of the two Yankee sluggers and several other lots featuring tobacco cards and 1940s Play Ball.    A fully graded 1956 Topps baseball set kicks off the post-War offerings, joined by complete 1951 Red and Blue back sets and a 1963 Topps set.  There are also 1950s and 60s stars including numerous Mickey Mantle cards. Among the modern card lots is a partial PSA 9-graded set of 1993 Topps Finest Baseball.  For those who really want a trip back into cardboard nostalgia, there are 1950s Exhibit and baseball card vending machines up for grabs.  Non-sports offerings include the highest graded 1953 Topps Who-Z-At set, a 1933 Jungle Gum graded set and many other vintage TV show master sets. There are dozens of autographed items, including those penned by Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle, with several of the latter carrying inscriptions.  A 1950 Yankees team signed baseball also includes one of the first signatures of Mantle with the Bronx Bombers while a rookie year government postcard carrying his early autograph is also on the block.     Other signed items include a Ty Cobb check, a Roy Campanella signed 1956 Topps card, a Derek Jeter Little Sun Prospect signed card, an Andre the Giant signed magazine, a 1986 World Series ticket signed by Buckner and Wilson and other items.

Now, redemption cards for complete sets of 1986-87 Fleer basketball are part of the 'Finale' of Jersey Fusion's ode to the original landmark product.","November 11, 2024 By Rich Mueller  Late last spring, cards from 50 complete sets of 1986-87 Fleer basketball and another hoard of 125 Michael Jordan rookie cards and stickers were put into a new product from Sportscards.com’s Jersey Fusion Line. Described as a years in the making “passion project” for company founder Bobby Poll, the Beckett encapsulated cards include small swatches of game-used gear used by the player on the card. Thousands of one card boxes were sold but six months later, the company has added some fresh content to the remaining inventory, including three redemption cards for fully PSA graded complete sets of cards and stickers, each with a Jordan rookie graded NM/MT 8.   The 1986-87 Fleer Jersey Fusion “Finale Edition” boxes also include a fourth redemption for a complete Jersey Fusion set of the 132 cards and 11 stickers that included the memorabilia pieces embedded in the holder. That set was originally pieced together by a collector who took advantage of the company’s offer last spring to trade it in for a game-worn, autographed 1991-92 Jordan jersey.  Sportscards.com is now giving that set back to the collecting community through the sales of the Finale edition. The product contains cards and memorabilia for all 131 players that were featured on the landmark Fleer set, which was the first in five years to be sold via wax packs.    At least three of the five boxes in a display case have autographed cards. Full cases contain six display cartons with a total of around 20 autographs. Some of the autographed cards carry inscriptions.  One of the biggest hits in the product One of the top pulls was an autographed Jordan rookie that carries a 9 autograph grade from Beckett and a portion of an NBA ‘Logoman’ patch from one of Jordan’s 1987-88 home uniforms. Other chase cards carry pieces of basketballs used in the NBA Finals.   Autographs from about 100 of the players in the set are possible, including Jordan, Julius Erving, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Charles Barkley and the late Bill Walton. A checklist that’s been pulled includes autographs of Erving, Bird and Johnson.  The back of each card in the product has a QR code on the reverse side that bring the collector to the site to see the original game-used  memorabilia item from which it was taken. Memorabilia used in the Jersey Fusion product came from jerseys, warm-ups, trunks, shoes, basketballs and even surfaces of NBA courts. Boxes and cases of the most recent edition are available here.  The previously released version, which still offers randomly packed Jordan rookie cards and stickers are still selling on eBay here.

The jersey, worn the day before he suited up for the last time, dates to Oct. 6, 2001.  It was one of the key items in an auction featuring items from his career that came from the late Hall of Famer’s family and were sold by The Realest, a memorabilia company that launched earlier this year.  The final games of Gwynn’s career took place slightly later than normal due to the Sept. 11 attacks. The jersey includes the American flag patch worn by on-field personnel after play resumed.  Another jersey with the flag patch, presumably from the same time period, sold for just over $5,000. Several other items sold for five-figure prices including Gwynn’s 1987 Gold Glove award ($25,001), his 1999 All-Star Game jersey ($12,555), his 1997 Silver Slugger award ($11,500) and a 1999 Padres alternate game jersey that included an inscription indicating it was from his 2,997th career hit.  A Willie Mays signed and inscribed 1970 Sports Illustrated, given to Gwynn in honor of his 3,000th hit netted $2,752.  Among the other items sold in the auction were Gwynn’s 1976 high school captain’s trophy ($2,200) and the ball from his RBI that broke the Padres’ career team RBI record—one he still holds ($1,139).

Sports Collectors Daily,Kahn’s Final Football Set In 1964 Was Colorful And Loaded With Stars,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/kahns-final-football-set-in-1964-was-colorful-and-loaded-with-stars/,"Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:30:24 +0000","Sixty years ago, Kahn's wrapped up a short run of football card set with their only full-color NFL offering.","November 11, 2024 By Bob D'Angelo  Let’s be frank: Kahn’s Wieners had a great run for enthusiastic foodie sports card collectors. In baseball, Kahn’s released sets from 1955 through 1969. The company added basketball cards to the mix in 1957, and those were issued through 1965. It was inevitable, perhaps, that the Cincinnati-based meat company would include pro football. Kahn’s produced sets from 1959 through 1964, and the final set is one of the most coveted. Kahn’s, which was founded by Elias Kahn as a meat market in 1883, became a landmark in Cincinnati. After he died in 1899, Kahn’s children founded E. Kahn’s and Sons, By 1926 it was one of the nation’s largest independent meat processing companies. The company’s slogan was  “The Wiener The World Awaited.” In the 1964 Kahn’s football set, some long-awaited technology was introduced: full-color photography.  The borderless cards measured 3 inches by 3 5/8 inches and 53 were different were on the checklist. The company’s slogan, which had appeared in a white rectangle at the bottom of the card fronts of previous Kahn’s football issues, was relegated to the backs in the 1964 set. The backs also contained statistics and brief biographical sketches.    The cards, which were not numbered, were included in select packages of the wieners and were referenced in advertising as “photos.”  For the second consecutive year, players from all 14 NFL teams were included. However, in keeping with the regional nature of the Kahn’s sets, nine cards feature members of the Cleveland Browns, who were on their way to the 1964 NFL championship. The set contains the top players of the 1960s and 19 future Hall of Famers, including Doug Atkins, Jim Brown, Mike Ditka, Paul Hornung, Sam Huff, John Henry Johnson, Alex Karras, Dick “Night Train” Lane, Jim Ringo, Joe Schmidt, Bart Starr, Fran Tarkenton, Jim Taylor, Y.A. Tittle, Johnny Unitas and Paul Warfield. The poses are classic 1960s football. Warfield’s card in the 1964 Kahn’s issue is the earliest to feature the smooth wide receiver, whose rookie card in mainstream cards was first introduced in the 1965 Philadelphia set. The cards are extremely difficult to find in high grade. Of the 1,242 cards submitted to PSA, only 17 achieved gem-mint status and 98 were PSA 9s. There are no PSA 10s of Brown and just six PSA 9s. There are also no PSA 10s of Hornung, Huff, Karras, Lane, Ringo, Schmidt, Starr, Tarkenton, Tittle and Warfield. Unitas has two gem-mint specimens and six that were graded PSA 9, along with Gary Collins and Jim Katcavage. Not surprisingly, the players with the most graded cards are Unitas (54) and Brown (43). Dallas quarterback Don Meredith, who had 20 cards from the set submitted to PSA, only had one card as high as PSA 9 and five at PSA 8. Over at SGC, only 161 cards have been submitted, and only one came back as a 10. That was of defensive back Clendon Thomas, who had a career season in 1963 when he intercepted eight passes for the Pittsburgh Steelers and was chosen for the Pro Bowl. Seven cards were graded as high as SGC 9, with Warfield’s card being one of them. Other notables at that grade included Ditka, Hornung, Katcavage and Norm Snead. The ’64 Kahn’s cards are fairly hard to locate outside the eastern third of the country. A higher grade near set–missing only one card–sold for a little over $2,400 last month.  That was a bit of a bargain.  Fewer than 100 can be found on eBay. The 1964 season was an interesting one for football. Topps lost its license for NFL trading cards and the Philadelphia Chewing Gum Corporation would issue cards that year and through 1967. In the meantime, Topps issued cards from the upstart AFL. In November 1964, the St. Louis Cardinals football team made noises about moving to Atlanta but were persuaded not to by city officials. Atlanta would get its own NFL franchise in 1966. Also in November, Frank and Martin “Buster” Loicano were convicted of accepting illegal bets on football cards while operating their coin-operated machine business. And an ad for Kahn’s Wieners in February 1964 noted that “famed economist” Nellie Oxrider recommended Kahn’s Wieners because “not only are they delicious, but digestible, too.” They were also the only meats used at the New York World’s Fair that year, the company noted. But as far as football cards were concerned, the string of Kahn’s sets was over after ’64. Bob has been a sportswriter and copy editor for more than 45 years and a blogger for two decades. He is celebrating his 60th year of card collecting, and still counts his 1965 Topps Mickey Mantle as his favorite.  You can reach him at [email protected].

Sports Collectors Daily,"After Tom Brady Signing Fiasco in Miami, Collectors Still Looking for Answers",https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/after-tom-brady-signing-fiasco-in-miami-collectors-still-looking-for-answers/,"Mon, 11 Nov 2024 03:29:39 +0000","Collectors who thought they could get a nice Tom Brady autograph on some valuable game-worn items and Super Bowl tickets are still frustrated, months after getting barely a scribble from the seven-time Super Bowl champ.","November 10, 2024 By Horacio Ruiz  More than six months after a much anticipated Tom Brady autograph signing in Miami, the collectors whose items were inked by Brady with an illegible scribble remain as disheartened, angry, and confused as the day it happened.  One collector is selling off his Brady collection, and another is trying to recoup some of his losses.  The entrance to Brad Jarrett’s house near Orlando, FL prominently featured his Brady memorabilia. The collection featured autographs and inscriptions on helmets, jerseys, and plaques. To Jarrett, Brady was a transcendent football player, but more importantly, a leader he hoped to emulate at his workplace.  “I’m still hurt by what happened at that event,” Jarrett told SC Daily. “I lost all my respect for Tom Brady.” What occurred at that event has been well documented. Brady was the keynote speaker for a business conference organized by EXMA Global, a marketing company specializing in leadership and development events.  As part of his appearance at the Watsco Center in Miami, Brady was contracted to sign about 100 items for patrons who paid $3,600 for a package deal that included Brady’s speech, a photo op and an autograph. The tickets also included a yacht tour of Downtown Miami and networking events at art galleries. Most of the attendees were there for business and networking opportunities and wouldn’t have requested Brady’s autograph on high value items.
 Before delivering a one-hour speech that the attendees praised, Brady was ushered into a room where the items collectors were hoping to have signed were located.  All were meticulously prepared for Brady by a local dealer named Salomon Lutwak. Instructions were placed by each item regarding where to sign with colored pens.    Lutwak, who lives in South Florida, wanted to get a Brady rookie card signed. He volunteered to prepare the items for the signing room because he was friends with many of the collectors in attendance.   When Brady entered the room, Lutwak was asked to leave by Brady’s handlers. When he returned, he couldn’t believe his eyes. Near the end of the speech, Lutwak approached Greg Nazareth, a friend of Jarrett’s, who was also at the conference.  “Bro, all the signatures look like s***,” Lutwak told Nazareth.  Lutwak recorded the room for 18 seconds, sending the clip to Nazareth, who then sent it to the other collectors. They were stunned.  One of the gems in Jarrett’s collection was a ticket from the 2000 NFL Draft, where Brady was famously picked 199th overall. It is one of a handful that are known to exist. From the moment he bought it, Jarrett knew it was the one item he wanted signed in person by Brady. He thought the signing session would be the time and place. He knew Brady’s signature wasn’t a work of art, but he expected it to be similar to others. As the event moved forward, Jarrett was unsure how his ticket had been signed. He didn’t see it in the short video circulating among the collectors. But he saw enough of the autographs on his friends’ items to get angry. He took the photo op to voice his displeasure directly with Brady.   “Tom, I saw the signatures, and it’s messed up what you did,” Jarrett recalls telling Brady. “It’s not right. I spent a lot of money on this.” He walked 30 feet off the stage, turned around, and found Brady staring at him.  “He looked at me like he was shocked I had said something,” Jarret said. “Or surprised that he impacted people with that autograph. I’m not really sure.
 “Brady just gave a great speech about effort and how when he started putting forward the effort in college, small gradual results started happening and that shaped him into giving 100% effort in everything he does. He just lied because he put 0% effort into his signing.”  Nazareth was next in line behind Jarrett, about nine feet away, when he saw Brady’s face. He brought the only known used Brady helmet in the hands of a collector to get signed – a Tampa Bay Buccaneers practice helmet. He considers himself lucky with the autograph he received.  “It wasn’t good,” said Nazareth of his autograph. “But it was better than some of the other crap I saw. Brady turned to [Brad] and gave him a look almost as if to apologize.” The events that unfolded in the room are still up for speculation, but what’s not up for debate is that Brady didn’t sign all the items with his customary autograph for some reason. Instead, some items were marked with a scribble that one would never have guessed came from the legendary quarterback. Brady is known to give a quick, shorthand autograph in large crowds, earning a moniker among collectors as Tornado Tom. However, in their opinion, most of the autographs were worse than those administered by Brady when in a rush.  Many of the items – rare collectibles and, in some instances, unique pieces – were no better off than if a child had taken a marker and scrawled across them.  It’s believed that Brady entered the room expecting to find items like copies of his book, “The TB12 Method,” and glossy photos to sign. Instead, he may have been taken aback to find rare one-of-a-kind items tracing the arc of his career and equipment he once wore on the field, like game-used Super Bowl balls, game-used cleats, the used practice helmet, and the NFL Draft ticket. Typically, Brady signs through Fanatics, with whom he has an exclusive autograph deal. Through Fanatics, Brady will sign items for $4,000. Game-used memorabilia carries a $10,000 fee. Many of the types of items he encountered that day would typically be channeled through Fanatics.  When Brady entered the signing room, he could have: Instead, Brady went with a fourth option, doling out an illegible scribble for many of the items that had been laid out for him. Brady did appear to sign some items in a condensed version that earned him the Tornado Tom nickname. But even those were few and mostly reserved for lower-end items like replica jerseys and pennants.  When Jarrett saw his autographed ticket, he was crushed. It looked a little better than the Super Bowl ticket Brady had signed for another collector, but not much. With his regular autograph, some items would have gone up in value by tens of thousands of dollars. “Tom is a smart guy, and he knows how much his signature adds to what items,” Jarrett said. “He doesn’t like people profiteering off him. If I was in his shoes, and there was all this collectible stuff, I’d be pissed too, but you don’t take it out on the fans. He could have not done it.” At the center of the dispute are the terms set by Brady’s representatives and EXMA Global Founder and CEO Fernando Anzures. Anzures admitted to not knowing much about the signing portion of the event. He sourced that responsibility to Fernando Regato, a sports collector based out of Mexico, who used the EXMA Conference as an opportunity to run his first-ever signing event.  It’s believed that Anzures sold the signing portion of the event to Regato and left it up to him to coordinate and iron out the details.  If the contract between EXMA Global and Brady included a clause about the type of items that could be signed, that wasn’t communicated to the collectors who attended.     Brady’s signing and photo op for the VIPs were a small portion of the EXMA Global Conference that ran through the weekend. However, to the collectors who bought the tickets for $3,600, the autograph opportunity was the primary draw. A handful of die-hard Brady collectors first learned about the signing on the Tom Brady Collectors Group on Facebook.  Derek Wagner, a high-end Brady collector for more than 20 years, was excited about flying to Miami to meet Brady and take a picture with him. He learned about signing on Facebook and became the liaison between himself and four other collectors, including Jarrett, Nazareth, and Regato.  “It was supposed to be one of the greatest times of my life,” Wagner told SC Daily. “How many people get to meet Tom Brady and get his autograph? He’s been my idol for 20-plus years.” The exact terms between Brady and EXMA are unknown, but it appears the seven-time Super Bowl champion wasn’t expecting to see a room with multiple high-value items.  “Regato was telling us any item would be signed,” Jarrett said. “We were wondering, ‘Is this for real?’ We asked a bunch of questions.” “I knew Brady is signed exclusively through Fanatics,” Nazareth said. “We knew he doesn’t do these public signings. But finally, enough of us bit, and we did the event.” Each $3,600 ticket would get one item signed. Wagner bought 15 tickets, six for him, one each for Jarrett and Nazareth, and seven tickets for two other collectors. He paid a portion of the tickets with a credit card and arranged with Regato to pay the remainder in cash. The cash came from Regato, who purchased two game-used Super Bowl balls from Wagner at the event. Regato included those two Super Bowl items in the signing, ironically receiving subpar Brady autographs.  The items Wagner submitted were:  In the aftermath, Anzures admitted to knowing less than he should have about the signing’s details. But he also pledged to make things right. Some wanted a full refund. Wagner filed a dispute with his credit card company, which Anzures did not fight. That resulted in a partial $1,900 refund for each ticket bought. However, Wagner says Regato never reimbursed him for the portion paid in cash.  The tickets were purchased under Wagner’s name, and he felt responsible for getting the money back for his friends.  “He straight up told me he doesn’t have it,” Wagner said of Regato. “He said, ‘I have $8,000 to my name and you can have it.’ I didn’t want $8,000. I wanted the entire thing refunded.” Anzures fully refunded some collectors who were trying to get rookie cards signed, according to USA Today, because Brady did not sign them due to his exclusive autographed card deal with Fanatics. Wagner says Regato told him that Anzures even refunded some collectors their flights and hotels. SC Daily contacted Anzures on multiple occasions, but he did not respond to our interview request.  After the event, Jarrett decided to write directly to Brady via his official Facebook and Instagram accounts.  “I was heartbroken when I saw pictures of the signatures before meeting you,” Jarrett wrote. “I hate admitting it as a grown man, but I was fighting back tears telling you this because I had envisioned the moment so differently. But I had to speak up for what I felt was right.” He wrote him about the 2000 NFL Draft ticket he had purchased less than a year before the signing.  “This ticket meant a lot to me. I had spent years hunting it down, and there have only been three known to come up. For me, this item represented that no matter where others rank you, you can turn yourself into greatness by hard work and dedication. I considered myself blessed that my prized possession wasn’t as messed up as others, but it still hurts, and I wish I had never attended this event.” Jarrett never heard back from anyone.  Wagner is a well-known collector and dealer in the northeast and Massachusetts. He had done various signings with former Red Sox and Patriots players. He reached out to multiple players who could help connect him with Brady, but no one was willing to try.  “Nobody was willing to give us a shot,” Wagner said. “I had never seen anything like it. It’s like they were scared of him.” Within a week of the event in Miami, Jarret, Nazareth and Wagner were referred to a Florida law firm with experience working cases involving celebrities. Over five months, Jarrett and Nazareth discussed scenarios where they sued Anzures and EXMA, Brady, or both. But Jarrett and Nazareth increasingly felt it would be a difficult case. After all, Brady had signed their items – and it would be difficult to argue any intentionally malicious destruction of property.  Ultimately, the firm wanted a $50,000 retainer plus a contingency fee from any monetary wins. The three men countered with a higher percentage for the contingency fee and lower retainer, but the firm declined.  At the same time, Wagner was talking to a prominent Boston-based lawyer. The lawyer agreed to work on a contingency basis, but after a month he told Wagner there wasn’t a case.  “The lawyer was working on it for a month, and he came up with three things we could go after him for, but then he said they’re not valid points,” Wagner said. “He said, ‘If this ever goes to court, there’s no case.’”  Now, it appears that a lawsuit won’t happen. “We were getting exhausted with what was going on,” Jarrett said. “At the time, Derek had made a deal with Goldin Auctions, where he was going to auction off all of the items that he had signed as long as he had consigned all the items with them.” Wagner still felt the weight of the responsibility for being the point person between the collectors and Anzures/Regato. While he was able to file a successful claim with his credit card company, the group was still down $26,000 from the trip to Miami.  Wagner was contacted by a representative from Goldin Auctions, who felt they could sell his six items for a premium, given the provenance from the Miami event and because of the controversial autographs on them. Goldin would give Wagner a bonus for consigning all six items from the signing with the auction house. Wagner would use the bonus to make everyone “whole” from the event and compensate for the cash that was never reimbursed. Wagner would also keep whatever amount the items sold for. But after three signed items were auctioned off in late September, Wagner broke the contract and pulled the other three items from being auctioned off. “They were very confident the items were going to sell for more than normal pieces because they were from this high-profile event,” Wagner said. “But they sold for all-time lows because the autographs clearly destroyed them.” A game-used cleat signed by Brady sold for $4,575, with a buyer’s premium. In all, Wagner says he lost $22,000 with the sale of the three items, including what he paid to get them signed.  “I signed a contract saying they would sell my other three items, and I broke the contract,” Wagner said. “My goal was to refund these other guys in full. I didn’t mind getting rid of my stuff to help everyone out. But I couldn’t keep taking that kind of beating.”  As a result, Goldin revoked the bonus. Wagner still has the Brady to Gronkowski Super Bowl ball, a Super Bowl 55 photo-matched game ball, and a game-used ball from the 2000 NFL Hall of Fame Game – Brady’s pro debut.  All the collectors remain baffled by what happened that day.  They wonder why Brady signed the way he did. Nazareth believes Brady didn’t know those items belonged to collectors but might have thought they belonged to the event organizers trying to take advantage of him.  “I think he knew exactly what he was doing,” Nazareth says. “I’ve followed Brady since he was in high school. He’s humble, he’s friendly, I think he genuinely cares about his fan base. The speech he gave for an hour was amazing and it’s stuff like that that makes me love the guy. I think he thought he might’ve been doing it to people who were trying to get one over him. Trust me, I was not trying to get one over him.”  A fan outside of the Watsco Center who did not attend the event was lucky enough to have a football signed with a nice autograph.  The ticket Jarrett was so eager to have signed by Brady is now in a closet, hidden in a bin along with other Brady programs and items. The ticket was sent to JSA for authentication, where three months after being sent, the autograph was authenticated.    “I am planning on holding onto the ticket for right now,” Jarrett says, “but I’m not really sure what I will do with it going forward. I’ve been slowly selling some of my smaller Brady items, but the collectible market is down right now. If I could break even on all my items, I would sell it all.” Wagner wants to know why Brady signed the way he did. He doesn’t want money or anything else signed; he just wants a direct answer.  “I have completely lost every ounce of respect I had for Brady, which is terrible because I was one of the biggest Brady collectors out there,” Wagner said. “I just want the stuff out of my house. I would love to know why he did that. Maybe he wasn’t trying to be an a-hole. I don’t know his side.  “As much as Tom is a celebrity and a GOAT, he’s human. He could’ve lost his temper. Just let us know what happened unless he was really out to get us, which I would find really hard to believe.” Horacio is an educator and writer living in Staten Island, NY.

The jersey has been photomatched to multiple games and bears numerous marks from use–even faint blood stains.  It was worn during a year in which Orr scored 122 points and led the Bruins to the Stanley Cup Final. The consignor is Patrick Schmautz, whose uncle Bobby Schmautz was acquired by the Bruins from the Vancouver Canucks on February 7th 1974. A young Patrick met Orr after a game when the superstar handed him the jersey, which was later signed by 22 men who played for the Bruins during the following season.

Thomas items include game-used sticks and masks from his time in the NHL and the US Olympic team.  In all, there are more than 1,600 lots being offered in the auction. One of the famous ‘eagle’ masks from Ed Belfour is part of a group consigned by the former goalie.  Another former netminder’s personal collection is on the block as well.  Carey Price has turned over some game-used equipment, bags and signed sticks from other NHL players. There are items from the career of Mats Naslund, including a 1986-87 Montreal Canadiens jersey, his 1986 NHL All-Star jersey and other pieces from the NHL and Swedish Olympic team. Mark Messier’s 1995-96 New York Rangers “500th goal” game-worn captain’s jersey is among dozens of other game jersey lots.

Oregon (10-0, 7-0), No. 1 in the CFP rankings released Tuesday, routed Maryland 39-18 last weekend behind three scoring passes by Gabriel, who broke the NCAA record for total career touchdowns. Wisconsin (5-4, 3-3) is coming off a bye after a 42-10 loss at Iowa, one of the worst defeats in Luke Fickell's two years as coach. ""We're still having a lot of fun, coming up every single day to get better and find ways to improve,"" Oregon coach Dan Lanning said Monday. ""The challenge of this new conference, the travel and some of the teams that we got to play, it's been a lot of fun for us."" Gabriel, a sixth-year transfer from Oklahoma, completed 23 of 34 passes for 183 yards against the Terrapins. That gave him 180 total touchdowns (147 passing, 33 rushing), surpassing the 178 touchdowns (155 passing, 23 rushing) that Case Keenum produced for Houston from 2007-11. Gabriel leads the nation in pass completion percentage at 74.1 percent (237 of 320) for 284.8 yards per game, with 22 touchdowns and five interceptions. Gabriel and the Ducks' passing game present obvious difficulties for the Badgers' secondary. ""They're going to be challenged in different ways,"" Fickell said Monday. ""That's the beauty of college football. You can be challenged each and every week in a lot of different ways and this one may be one we haven't seen really the entire year. ""The ability for them to throw the ball downfield. The dynamic of the wide receivers that they have. Obviously, the quarterback and the ability of him to make plays both with his feet and in the air."" James Jordan paces the Ducks' ground game with 946 yards (5.7 per carry) and 10 touchdowns. Oregon has been efficient in the red zone with 39 scores in 44 opportunities, including 32 touchdowns. The Ducks, who have scored 30 or more points in each of their past nine games, average 35.7 points while allowing 16. Oregon averages 457 yards per contest and is giving up 293.7. Wisconsin took consecutive early-season losses to Alabama and Southern California, then dominated Purdue, Rutgers and Northwestern during a three-game winning streak. However, the Badgers have since lost to Penn State, now No. 4 in the CFP rankings, and Iowa. In their five victories, the Badgers outscored opponents 34.4 to 8.6 per game, with a 454-239 average advantage in total yards. In four losses, Wisconsin was outscored 37.5 to 13.5. Redshirt sophomore Braedyn Locke, who took over at quarterback when Tyler Van Dyke suffered a season-ending knee injury against Alabama, threw two costly interceptions against Iowa. Locke has completed 56.8 percent of his passes for 177.3 yards per game, but he has eight picks along with eight touchdown tosses. Against Iowa, the Badgers allowed 329 rushing yards, 6.1 yards per carry. In the teams' most matchup, Oregon edged Wisconsin 28-27 in the 2020 Rose Bowl when the Ducks were still in the Pac-12. The Badgers have not defeated a No. 1-ranked team since a 31-18 upset of Ohio State in 2010. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The unique setting for the game should keep the Buckeyes (8-1, 5-1 Big Ten) fully engaged despite being more than a four-touchdown favorite against the Wildcats (4-5, 2-4 Big Ten) for the game at Wrigley Field in Chicago. ""It's a different feel, but it's a great opportunity for our team,"" Ohio State coach Ryan Day said. ""And ultimately, there'll be 100 yards of football field, and there'll be stands on both sides and we'll compete, so we're excited about that."" Ohio State remained one spot behind Oregon in the College Football Playoff rankings released Tuesday. The Buckeyes lost a road game to the Ducks, 32-31, on Oct. 12. If both teams win out, they would play in the Big Ten title game on Dec. 7 in Indianapolis. ""Every week for us is like the playoffs right now,"" Day said. ""We're fighting for a chance to get to Indianapolis. It's always a topic of conversation, and it's going to come down to our seniors and leaders and how they echo that message."" The Saturday game will be the Buckeyes' first contest at the venerable home of the Chicago Cubs. Northwestern has played there three times since 2010, including a 10-7 loss to Iowa last season. ""We benefit from the fact not only has the program been to Wrigley prior, but we were there just last year so logistically there are some things our guys are comfortable with in terms of what game day's going to look like,"" Northwestern coach David Braun said. A major complaint about the set-up for previous games has been addressed for Saturday and Northwestern's game on Nov. 30 against Illinois at Wrigley Field. An adjustment was made to the layout of the football field enabling sidelines to be across from each other rather than having the teams share a sideline. ""We feel really confident that this is a great setup, and having two opposite sidelines in a traditional manner is important,"" Braun said. Capacity at Wrigley Field is around 41,000, far bigger than the 12,023-seat temporary stadium that is being used this season and next while Ryan Field is being rebuilt. Braun hopes the crowd will give the Wildcats a home-field advantage against an Ohio State team coming off its best all-around game in a 45-0 win against Purdue. The Buckeyes received solid performances from the offense and defense in addition to blocking a punt to set up the game's first touchdown. Ohio State quarterback Will Howard threw for 260 yards and three TDs while running for a score in the victory. He has 22 touchdown passes (against five interceptions) and six scoring runs this year. ""What we've done leading up to this point really has nothing to do with what's going on moving forward,"" Day said. ""It's November. We want to be undefeated in November."" Northwestern last played on Nov. 2 when the Wildcats defeated Purdue 26-20 in overtime. Joseph Himon II caught a 22-yard pass from Jack Lausch for the win after Northwestern stopped the Boilermakers on fourth down to open OT. The Wildcats have beaten the Buckeyes once in the past 34 meetings since 1972 and have lost 10 straight in the series after a 33-27 overtime win in 2004. ""We know we're the underdog,"" Braun said. ""We know not just an underdog, there's no one out there that expects Northwestern to go in and beat Ohio State or, for that matter, compete. ""But this group believes that with a great two weeks of preparation and us showing up at our best we can make this a four-quarter battle, make it close in the fourth quarter, look up with zeros on the clock and the expectation is to expect victory."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Thompson turned back the clock with 22 points and Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combined for 52 more, but the Mavericks scored only three points over the final 3:29 after taking a 114-108 lead. Curry did all the Golden State scoring after that, including an interior hoop that put the Warriors on top for good at 115-114 with 1:50 remaining and a 3-pointer -- followed by his trademark night-night gesture -- to create a four-point lead with 27.5 seconds left. Quentin Grimes kept Dallas' hopes alive with a 3-pointer six seconds later, but Curry followed that with two free throws before Doncic missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer with five seconds remaining.  Knicks 111, 76ers 99 OG Anunoby scored 24 points and Josh Hart recorded a triple-double as New York spoiled Joel Embiid's season debut with a road win over Philadelphia. After missing six games due to a lingering knee injury and three more following a suspension for shoving a reporter, Embiid returned to the court in a competitive setting for the first time since the Olympics. He played 26 minutes and shot 2 of 11 from the floor, finishing with 13 points, five assists and three rebounds. Hart finished with 14 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists. Paul George had 29 points and 10 rebounds to pace Philadelphia. Pistons 123, Heat 121 (OT) Malik Beasley made a go-ahead technical free throw with 1.1 seconds left in overtime and host Detroit escaped with a wild victory over Miami.  Tyler Herro (40 points), who scored the last nine points of regulation, all on 3-pointers, to force overtime, gave the Heat a two-point lead on a bank shot with 1.8 seconds left in the extra session. An alley-oop dunk by Jalen Duren off an inbounds pass tied the score. The Heat called a timeout they didn't have, resulting in the technical and a 122-121 Pistons lead. Beasley then split two free throws after Miami was called for a take foul. Beasley and Cade Cunningham notched 21 points apiece for Detroit. Herro's 10 3-pointers tied a Heat record and are an NBA Cup single-game record. Hawks 117, Celtics 116 Jalen Johnson had 18 points, 13 rebounds, 10 assists and three steals to lead visiting Atlanta to a victory over Boston.  Jaylen Brown and Derrick White scored season highs of 37 points and 31 points, respectively, for the Celtics. White was 7 of 12 from 3-point territory and 10 of 15 overall, also adding six rebounds and five assists. Atlanta took a 117-116 lead when Onyeka Okongwu tipped in a missed shot with 6.1 seconds to play. After each team turned the ball over in the final seconds, Brown missed a 13-foot jumper at the buzzer. Magic 114, Hornets 89 Franz Wagner pumped in 32 points as Orlando cruised past visiting Charlotte.  Moritz Wagner scored 18 points off the bench and Jalen Suggs tallied all 17 of his points in the first half for Orlando, which has its first three-game winning streak of the season. Franz Wagner made 14 of 25 shots from the field as the Magic shot 46.2 percent overall.  LaMelo Ball's 35 points and Grant Williams' 15 points paced the Hornets, who have lost two straight games. Ball, who sank six shots from 3-point range, ended up with seven assists and six rebounds.  Bucks 99, Raptors 85 Giannis Antetokounmpo led five Milwaukee scorers in double figures in overcoming a monster night from Gradey Dick to beat visiting Toronto.  Bobby Portis had 17 points off the bench for the Bucks. Milwaukee played without star guard Damian Lillard (concussion protocol). He could return for Wednesday's game against the Pistons. Dick, the 20-year-old second-year pro from Kansas, finished with a career-high 32 points. Teammate Jakob Poeltl scored 13 points and had eight rebounds, three steals and two blocks, but the Raptors fell for the fifth straight game. Suns 120, Jazz 112 Devin Booker and Bradley Beal combined to make 9 of 16 3-pointers en route to 31 and 24 points, respectively, and Phoenix downed Utah in Salt Lake City. Mason Plumlee recorded a double-double of 15 points and 14 rebounds while starting in place of an injured Jusuf Nurkic (ankle) for Phoenix, which was also without All-NBA forward Kevin Durant due to a calf strain.  Jordan Clarkson's 4-of-9 night led Utah to 15-of-38 shooting (39.5 percent) from 3-point range. Clarkson finished with 16 points off the bench. Jazz rookie Kyle Filipowski added 18 points off the bench, and Lauri Markkanen scored 17. Trail Blazers 122, Timberwolves 108 Jerami Grant scored 21 points and Robert Williams III added 19 as Portland beat visiting Minnesota.  Seven players scored in double figures for the Trail Blazers, who made a season-high 18 3-pointers and snapped a three-game losing streak. Naz Reid came off the bench to lead the Timberwolves with a season-high 28 points. Anthony Edwards scored 26 for Minnesota, which committed 23 turnovers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Thompson turned back the clock with 22 points, and Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combined for 52 more, but the Mavericks scored only three points over the final 3:29 after taking a 114-108 lead. Curry did all the Golden State scoring after that, including an interior hoop that put the Warriors on top for good at 115-114 with 1:50 remaining and a 3-pointer -- followed by his trademark night-night gesture -- to create a four-point lead with 27.5 seconds left. Quentin Grimes kept Dallas' hopes alive with a 3-pointer six seconds later, but Curry followed that with two free throws and Doncic missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer with five seconds left.

A 30-23 loss at then-No. 23 Missouri on Saturday dropped the Sooners' record to 5-5 overall, 1-5 in the Southeastern Conference. Oklahoma has dropped four of its past six games following a 3-0 start. Harroz said, ""We all get emotional over during the course of a season. What's unwavering is the commitment to him. This is a new era for us, but it's also a new era for college athletics, and there's going to be a lot of adjustment, and there's going to be a lot that takes place. As far as my commitment to Coach Venables, it's 100 percent."" Castiglione said, ""Obviously the season thus far has not gone as we'd hoped or planned. We're mindful that we haven't met the Oklahoma standard for 2024. That said, we truly believe in Coach Venables and our team and are completely focused on both supporting them and looking at all of the ways to address the needed improvements now as soon as possible as well as in preparation for next year."" Venables, 53, owns a 21-15 record over his three seasons in charge of the Sooners. He never previously served as a head coach, having served as defensive coordinator at Oklahoma and Clemson. He is under contract through 2029, and a buyout following the current season would cost the school $44.8 million, according to The Oklahoman newspaper. The Sooners are off this week ahead of their final two regular-season games: at home against No. 10 Alabama on Nov. 23 and at No. 23 LSU on Nov. 30.

Seattle's Jared McCann won a faceoff in the offensive zone and got the puck to Eberle along the goal line on the left wing. Eberle fired a pass across the top of the crease, and Tolvanen tipped it in near the far post. The assist gave McCann 200 career points with the Kraken, making him the first to reach that mark with the franchise.

They also get to sit in on meetings, attend practices and have team meals together. ""It's very exciting,"" forward Brett Howden said. ""It's fun for all the dads to be around and obviously have a little buzz going with all the excitement. It's just fun to see all the dads."" The Golden Knights, who are one point behind the first-place Los Angeles Kings in the Pacific Division, can definitely use a little pick-me-up. Their eight-game home winning streak, which matched a franchise record, ended Monday with a 5-2 loss to Carolina. Vegas, which was outshot 16-4 in the opening period, fell behind 4-0 in the first 26:13 and didn't score until the 6:11 mark of the third period on a goal by Jack Eichel goal. Starting goaltender Adin Hill became the first Golden Knights goalie to be pulled from a game this season after yielding four goals on 21 shots. ""When it's 4-0, it's tough to come back,"" center William Karlsson said. ""It always sucks when a goalie has to come out of the nets."" ""I wouldn't put it on Hilly,"" Cassidy said. ""I'm not putting any of the game on Hilly. It was just about changing the momentum."" Anaheim snapped a four-game losing streak with a 4-2 victory over Columbus on Sunday as John Gibson made 38 saves in his season debut. The 31-year-old Gibson, who picked up his 194th career win, had been sidelined while recovering from emergency appendectomy surgery on Sept. 25. ""I played catch-up a lot (during) training camp and the last few weeks,"" Gibson said. ""Credit to the guys for coming on early, staying on after, shooting on me and help me get the work to prepare and get back into game speed. ... It was a good team effort."" Ducks coach Greg Cronin got goals from all four of his newly formed lines. Brett Leason and defenseman Jackson LaCombe each scored their first goals of the season, while Leo Carlsson and Isac Lundestrom also found the back of the net. It marked just the second time this season that Anaheim, which has scored an NHL-low 31 goals, scored four goals in a game. ""We've been trying to bingo-ball lines together,"" Cronin said. ""Try and create some identity within the lines, which would obviously strengthen our team identity. We keep putting pucks (on net), and I think that'll unlock some of this frustration with the scoring."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

USC (2-0) needed a late-game surge to hold off Idaho State 75-69 last Thursday. Josh Cohen scored 19 points to lead three Trojans scorers in double figures, a trio that included Saint Thomas with 10 points, nine assists, seven rebounds and two steals. The Trojans shot 24 of 56 (42.9 percent) from the floor, and 20 of those baskets came with assists. In USC's 77-51 season-opening blowout of Chattanooga on Nov. 4, 21 of its 32 field goals were assisted. ""I'm feeling very good about this team,"" Thomas said. ""I've said since the start that I think we can make a run late in March Madness, but it starts with just being disciplined."" Part of USC's offensive discipline has included limiting turnovers, with a combined 15 through two games. Effective ball movement has resulted in balanced scoring, with Wesley Yates III, Chibuzo Agbo, Desmond Claude and Matt Knowling all showing early breakout potential. UT Arlington (1-1) comes in with Jaden Wells, Raysean Seamster and Troy Hupstead putting up points through two games.  The trio combined for 51 points, but the Mavericks got only 26 from the rest of the team in a 92-77 home loss to Louisiana Tech on Saturday.  Hupstead scored 20 points on 6-of-9 shooting from the floor, while Wells shot 4-of-11 from 3-point distance en route to 17 points.  Hupstead, Wells and Seamster are newcomers, along with most of the UT Arlington roster, which underwent almost a complete overhaul after last season's 20-win campaign.  ""We have 11 new guys. We're still trying to feel each other, but that's no excuse,"" said Mavericks coach KT Turner, who is in his second season at the helm. ""It's all about getting better. It's a process for us.

Raynaud, who returned to Stanford after entering the transfer portal following Haase's departure, was one of five Cardinal players to score in double-figure against Northern Arizona (2-1). Oziyah Sellers finished with 17 points, sophomore Ryan Agarwal had a career-high 15 points, Duke transfer Jaylen Blakes scored 13 and Benny Gealer had 10. Northern Arizona was led by Trenton McLaughlin's 20 points. Oakland Fort added 13 points on 6-of-9 shooting from the field, and Carson Towt had 10 points. A 3-pointer by Dylan Baker with 15:19 left in the first half put Northern Arizona ahead 13-4. The Lumberjacks then went scoreless for more than six minutes as Stanford reeled off a 16-0 run.

Anders Lee scored twice in the final seven-plus minutes for the Islanders before the Oilers collected all four shots in overtime. With the New York trio of Bo Horvat, Simon Holmstrom and Ryan Pulock nearing their second full minute on the ice, Draisaitl and McDavid entered in a shift change. McDavid took a pass from Evan Bouchard and dished to Draisaitl, who beat Ilya Sorokin from point-blank range. Bouchard (two assists) and McDavid also scored for the Oilers, who have won two straight following a two-game skid. McDavid had three assists to move within one point of 1,000 for his career. Goalie Stuart Skinner made 19 saves. Kyle Palmieri scored in the second for the Islanders, who lost in overtime for the second straight game. Sorokin recorded 38 saves. After a scoreless first, Draisaitl snapped the tie with a power-play goal 36 seconds into the middle period. Palmieri tied the score with 4:02 left in the second when he took a pass from Maxim Tsyplakov and immediately beat Skinner under his stick arm. Bouchard scored to cap an extended flurry in the Islanders' zone 57 seconds into the third before McDavid lengthened the lead to 3-1 with 9:41 left. McDavid knocked over Oliver Wahlstrom to intercept Noah Dobson's pass before eventually taking a no-look pass from Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and sending a backhand between Dobson and Isaiah George and beyond Sorokin's glove. Lee began the Islanders' comeback 2:35 later, when a shot by Pulock bounced off Skinner's pads and to Lee, who'd just hit the ice on a shift change. Sorokin was pulled for an extra attacker moments before Lee took a pass from Jean-Gabriel Pageau and sent a point-blank shot beyond a crouching Bouchard and under Skinner's legs with 2:40 remaining. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Los Angeles started the campaign by dropping three of four games, but since then, it has not won or lost more than two in a row. If the up-and-down play continues, the Kings could be in line for a victory when they visit the Colorado Avalanche in Denver on Wednesday night. Los Angeles is coming off a 3-1 loss against the Calgary Flames on Monday night to kick off a quick two-game road trip. The Kings and Avalanche will now meet for the first of three matchups this season, and for Los Angeles goaltender Darcy Kuemper, it's a reunion with his former team. Kuemper, who backstopped Colorado's 2022 Stanley Cup title, made 25 saves on Monday but came out on the losing end. Los Angeles wasn't happy with its play against the Flames, who scored twice in a span of 36 seconds in the second period to grab a 2-0 lead. The Kings couldn't generate enough offense to pull even. ""It was just one of those games where we didn't connect, we didn't play well enough, we didn't have the energy that you need,"" Kings captain Anze Kopitar said. ""We're playing catch-up for the better part of half of the game and yet we were still in it until the very end. Everything has to be better."" Coming off a 3-2 overtime victory against the Nashville Predators on Monday, the Avalanche have won the first two games of a four-game homestand that wraps up on Friday night. By then, Colorado could nearly have its full complement of forwards. Jonathan Drouin, who has been out since sustaining an upper-body injury in the Avalanche's season opener back on Oct. 9, is close to returning, as is Miles Wood. Wood has missed the past six games with an upper-body injury, but both players were skating in regular jerseys during practice on Tuesday.  Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said that he would talk to team trainers before making a final decision on the duo. Colorado assigned forwards T.J. Tynan and Nikita Prishchepov to the AHL, which could indicate that Wood and Drouin will be in the lineup on Wednesday.  Valeri Nichushkin, who has been suspended since this past spring, is eligible to return on Friday and is expected to be in the lineup. He was placed in Stage 3 of the Player Assistance Program during last season's playoffs. That leaves Ross Colton (foot) and captain Gabriel Landeskog (knee) as the only top-six forwards on the shelf for the Avalanche.  The Avalanche have stayed above water despite all the injuries largely due to the performances of stars Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar, who are among the NHL's point leaders. Makar's defensive partner, Devon Toews, has struggled a bit, but Bednar said he has not felt fully healthy all season. ""(Toews) at 80 percent is still better than lots of other players in the league,"" Bednar said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Amari Williams added 10 points and eight rebounds for the Wildcats, who finished on an 8-2 run after trailing by as much as 10 in the first half. Duke (2-1) was led by freshman phenom Cooper Flagg's 26 points and 12 rebounds. Kon Knueppel added 14 points, and Tyrese Proctor put up 12. Khaman Maluach tallied 10 points and seven rebounds in the loss. Carr's three-point play tied the game at 67 with 3:57 left before Oweh's layup at the 2:40 mark gave the Wildcats their first lead since just past the midpoint of the first half. Flagg answered with a three-point play, but Carr matched him on the next possession, as his three-point play put Kentucky ahead 72-70 with 1:49 remaining. Flagg then tied the game with a floater with 1:14 left before the Wildcats' Kerr Kriisa missed a jumper, which was rebounded by Flagg. On the ensuing possession, Oweh stole the ball from Flagg, then knocked down two free throws after being fouled by Knueppel. Flagg then dribbled out of bounds, and Kentucky made three free throws in the final five seconds to ice the game. Flagg opened the game's scoring on the receiving end of an alley-oop from Caleb Foster before Proctor's layup put Duke ahead 4-0. With 16:21 left in the half, Oweh drilled a 3-pointer to give Kentucky a 9-8 advantage -- the Wildcats' first lead of the game.

Mason Plumlee recorded a double-double of 15 points and 14 rebounds starting in place of an injured Jusuf Nurkic (ankle) for Phoenix, who was also without All-NBA forward Kevin Durant out for a second game due to a calf strain.  Despite missing two starters, Phoenix pounced on Utah early.  The Suns only trailed momentarily in the first quarter before going on a 15-4 run that opened up their first double-digit-point lead of the night. Phoenix's advantage grew to as many as 18 in the second quarter.  Utah, seeking its first win at home this season, chipped away at the deficit in the second half. Jordan Clarkson connected on a pair of 3-pointers in the final minute, both of which pulled the Jazz to within six, but they could get no closer.  Phoenix's 15-of-20 to 7-of-9 edge at the free-throw line helped keep Utah at arm's length. The Suns also benefited from outgunning the Jazz beyond the 3-point arc on a night both teams shot well from deep.  Beal, who shot 4-of-7, and Booker at 5-of-9 helped Phoenix to an 18-of-39 performance (46.2 percent) from long range. Grayson Allen came off the bench to knock down 4-of-9 beyond the arc, part of his 15 points.  Clarkson's 4-of-9 night led Utah to 15-of-38 shooting (39.5 percent) from 3-point range, including the two down the stretch. Clarkson finished with 16 points off the bench. Jazz rookie Kyle Filipowski added 18 off the bench and Lauri Markkanen scored 17. Utah also got a big second-half effort from John Collins, who scored six straight points over a stretch midway through the fourth. Collins' flurry, part of a team-high 29 points, could not make a dent with Devin Booker answering with five points during the stretch and Royce O'Neal hitting a 3-pointer that pushed the Phoenix lead to 13.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Grizzlies face the Lakers in Los Angeles this time, and the game will have a decidedly different feel from the one last week, when Memphis was a runaway 131-114 winner. Ja Morant was one of three Grizzlies with 20 points in the victory, but he departed in the third quarter due to a hip injury and has not played since. Considered week-to-week, he has no timetable for his return. With Morant a mere observer, Memphis still won its past two games, averaging 131 points in those contests. The most recent victory came Sunday on the road against the Portland Trail Blazers by a 134-89 count, as Jaren Jackson Jr. posted 20 points as one of seven Grizzlies scorers in double figures. The 45-point winning margin was the fourth largest in Memphis franchise history. It was the third consecutive game the Grizzlies had seven players score in double figures, all victories, and Jay Huff tied a franchise record for a bench player with six blocked shots. The Trail Blazers made just four of their 42 shots from 3-point range (9.5 percent). The impressive victory, led by Jackson on both the offensive and defensive ends, not only came without Morant, but Desmond Bane (oblique) and Marcus Smart (ankle) were also unavailable. ""Regardless of what our lineups are, I want (Jackson) to still carry that mentality of being a primary attack guy for us, and that's on me to make sure that he's feeling involved,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. The Lakers ended a rough 1-4 road trip with the loss at Memphis, but they have been better upon their return home. Los Angeles beat the Philadelphia 76ers 116-106 on Friday, then earned a 123-103 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Sunday. LeBron James recorded his third triple-double of the season, and second consecutive, in the Sunday contest by supplying 19 points, 16 assists and 10 rebounds. Anthony Davis scored 22 points but left in the third quarter after he was poked in the eye. He will return to face the Grizzlies on Wednesday. ""There's nothing I need to do,"" said Davis, who also had eye injuries twice toward the end of last regular season but has no interest in wearing protective eyewear. ""The next step is getting some more sleep and getting ready for (Memphis)."" Los Angeles guard D'Angelo Russell, who was moved into a reserve role after the road trip following some early-season struggles, missed practice on Tuesday due to an illness. While Los Angeles struggled on its road trip, it is 5-0 at home to begin the campaign. Accused at various points of his career of not being assertive in some late-game situations, James continues to cite the appeal of seeing his teammates have success. It apparently never gets old, even after 22 seasons. ""That's always been my basketball pleasure, being able to just kind of read the game and put the ball, like I said, for guys to just be able to just catch, shoot, layup, dunk, whatever it is,"" said James, who is averaging 23.2 points, 7.7 rebounds and 8.9 assists less than two months away from his 40th birthday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Freemantle led a scorching performance from the field for Xavier, which shot 54.1 percent from the floor and hit 16 of 31 3-pointers. The big man finished 8-of-11 overall and went 4-of-5 from distance. The Musketeers had six players score in double figures. Dante Maddox Jr. tallied 16 points off the bench, Trey Green had 15 points, Ryan Conwell netted 14 and John Hugley IV finished with 11.  Xavier (3-0) has two games remaining on its season-opening, five-game homestand.  Jayme Mitchell Jr. had a game-high 26 points and Romelle Mansel added nine points and seven rebounds to lead Jackson State (0-3), which is just three games into a brutal 13-game road trip to open the season.  The Musketeers drained four of their first five 3-pointers to open up a 14-2 lead just over four minutes into the game. Conwell, an Indiana State transfer, made Xavier's first two 3-point attempts to continue his hot start with his new team. Freemantle helped the Musketeers build their lead to 33-14 on his third triple with just under seven minutes left in the half.  As red-hot as Xavier was to start the game, Jackson State was ice-cold. The Tigers missed their first seven shots and 10 of their first 11 from the floor.  Jackson State was looking for some momentum just before half when Dorian McMillian stole a pass from Conwell near midcourt. McMillian was going in for a dunk just before the halftime buzzer when Hugley came racing over for a thunderous block that brought the Xavier crowd to its feet and sent the Musketeers to the locker room with a 40-25 lead.  Nine straight misses by the Tigers eventually allowed Xavier to expand its lead to 54-29 midway through the second half. Jackson State missed 30 of its first 41 shots, including misfires on 10 of 15 layups.  Jackson State, which lost 97-40 in its opener at No. 4 Houston, plays at Vanderbilt on Saturday and Western Kentucky on Wednesday before facing No. 19 Kentucky on Nov. 22. The Tigers' home opener is Jan. 11. --Mike Petraglia, Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

New Jersey's Jack Hughes became the fastest player in franchise history to record 300 career points with a first-period goal.  Paul Cotter and Ondrej Palat provided insurance with late third-period tallies. Jesper Bratt and Dougie Hamilton each notched two assists to propel the Devils to their sixth win in their last eight games. Florida's Sam Reinhart scored on the power play for his team-leading 12th goal of the season.  Spencer Knight made 20 saves in his first start since Nov. 2 for the Panthers, who played without Sam Bennett (upper-body injury).  The teams will square off again on Thursday at the same venue. New Jersey took advantage of a Florida turnover at the offensive blue line to claim a 2-1 lead with 2:31 remaining in the second.  Meier skated in on a breakaway and wristed a low shot just above the pad of Knight for his seventh goal of the season.  Cotter's sharp wrist shot from the left circle sailed under the crossbar with 4:53 left in the third. The goal was Cotter's seventh of the season. Palat capped the scoring by finding the empty net with 1:02 to play, his third tally of the season. Skating near the left point, Bratt backhanded a saucer pass that Hughes converted deep in the right circle to open the scoring at 8:30 of the first. The Florida native's goal was his eighth of the season and fourth in his last four games. The Devils preserved that slim advantage by killing a 5-on-3 power play late in the first. Florida broke through at 8:41 of the second to forge a 1-1 tie. Uvis Balinskis' wrist shot from the point was deflected home by Reinhart, giving the latter seven goals in his last seven games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

I have more followers than him, etc. And now (Friday) is going to be the most watched fight of this century, so I'm going to be the new money magnet."" Paul vs. Tyson will be streamed on Netflix.

The Hornets shot just 40.5 percent from the field and struggled at the free-throw line by going 8-for-14.

Franz Wagner had nine points in the quarter, while Jonathan Isaac chipped in all seven of his points for the game on 3-of-3 shooting off the bench. Orlando stretched its lead to as many as 30 points in the fourth quarter.

Orlando shot 53.3 percent from the field in the first half and benefited from Charlotte's 13 turnovers to lead 58-47 at the break. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Daquan Davis scored a team-high nine points while Jamir Watkins, Chandler Jackson, Justin Thomas and Bostyn Holt each scored eight points to lead the Seminoles (3-0). Florida State secured its first undefeated start after three games since the 2020-21 season. That was the last time Florida State made it to the NCAA Tournament. The Seminoles are hoping for such a revival this season with an influx of new talent that has so far showcased its depth and prowess on the defensive end. Both are attributes of longtime coach Leonard Hamilton's teams when the Seminoles were NCAA Tournament regulars in recent years. A total of 12 Seminoles scored in the game and eight scored six or more points. Chris Mpaka led Tarleton State (0-3) with 15 points, 11 rebounds and five blocks as the Texans finished with four players scoring in double figures. Matt Krass and Bubu Benjamin each scored 11 points while Nick Krass finished with 10 points and four rebounds. Mistakes by Florida State helped keep the game close in the first half. The Seminoles committed 12 turnovers before halftime. But FSU cleaned things up in the second half and committed only five turnovers, helping it go on a 27-10 run that broke the game open. Florida State led by as many as 25 points in the second half and controlled the game on the boards and in the paint. The Seminoles outscored the Texans 34-14 in the paint and had a 37-25 rebounding edge, while collecting 11 offensive boards, which led to 15 second-chance points. Florida State also limited Tarleton State to 31.1 percent shooting and only 4-for-15 shooting from 3-point range, which helped make up for the Seminoles' own poor shooting from long distance (4-for-21). The Seminoles, however, earned numerous trips to the free-throw line and went 24-for-38 shooting from there while the Texans went 20 of 28. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Cal State Fullerton shot just 13-of-40 (32.5 percent) from the floor on Friday against the Cardinal and conceded 19 points off turnovers. The Titans trailed by just three points at halftime before being outscored 50-26 after the break.

Winnipeg also improved to 7-0-0 on the road and ran their overall winning streak to seven games. Scheifele scored 57 seconds into the game and a little over a minute into the third period. Connor gave Winnipeg a 3-2 lead late in the second period, added an empty-netter in the final minute and had an assist. Gabriel Vilardi and Vladislav Namestnikov also scored for the Jets, and Neal Pionk and Nikolaj Ehlers each had two assists. Connor Hellebuyck made 33 saves for the win. Will Cuylle had a goal and an assist and Alexis Lafreniere and  Kaapo Kakko also scored for the Rangers, who frequently struggled with puck control and fell to 4-4-0 in their past eight games since starting 5-0-1. New York goalie Igor Shesterkin stopped 27 shots. The Jets snapped a 2-2 deadlock when New York's Mika Zibanejad fumbled the puck along the half-boards deep in the Rangers' offensive zone. He lost the puck to Pionk, who sprung Connor on the odd-man rush. Connor motored down the left side, eluded Rangers defenseman K'Andre Miller and tucked a shot from the left circle inside the post for his 10th goal at 16:03 of the second period. The Jets started their latest win by capitalizing on a turnover by Zibanejad in the opening minute. Josh Morrissey intercepted an errant clearing attempt and sent it to a cutting Scheifele, who moved through the slot past defenseman Adam Fox and lifted a shot over Shesterkin's stick. New York evened it at 13:07 of the first when Cuylle pushed the rebound of Braden Schneider's shot over Hellebuyck's pad.

The Bulldogs weren't without their own struggles, though.

Daemar Kelly netted 10 points, but Saint Francis simply didn't have enough offense, making only 37.3 percent from the field. The Nittany Lions' pressure defense wore down the Red Flash just before the midway point of the second half. It was 64-52 after Jeremy Clayville hit a 3-pointer for Saint Francis with 13:20 left, but Penn State ripped off 15 straight points to seal the outcome. Penn State got off to a fast start, opening up an 11-0 lead two minutes into the game when Johnson canned a 3-pointer to force a timeout. The Nittany Lions started the game with an alley-oop dunk and then drained three consecutive 3-pointers. Saint Francis got its bearings shortly thereafter and worked its way into a rhythm, making its first field goal nearly five minutes in. The Red Flash even assumed a brief lead when Kelly converted a short jumper to make it 34-33 with 2:17 to go until halftime. Penn State regained the lead for good on its next possession. Johnson's 3-pointer started a six-point run that helped the Nittany Lions take a 45-38 cushion into the break. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Dajuan Harris Jr. added 11 points, while Rylan Griffen scored 10 for the Jayhawks (3-0), who shot 40.6 percent from the field. Zeke Mayo chipped in six points, 10 rebounds and seven assists in the win. Frankie Fidler led the Spartans (2-1) with 15 points, followed by Jaxon Kohler's 12 points and 10 boards. Michigan State made 24 of its 69 shots from the field (34.8 percent) and shot just 12.5 percent from 3-point range (3 for 24). Kansas took the lead for good on KJ Adams' free throws with 8:37 left in the game, which sparked a 6-0 run that propelled the Jayhawks ahead 58-52. The Spartans closed to within 63-59 before Harris scored five straight points, extending the Jayhawks' advantage to nine with 4:25 remaining.  Dickinson's layup put Kansas up 70-61 at the 2:11 mark, and the Jayhawks led by at least five the rest of the way. Kansas' 7-foot-2 star center scored the game's first six points - and the Jayhawks' first eight - before Coen Carr's free throws stamped an 8-0 run that swung the Spartans ahead 10-8 at the 12:08 mark of the first half. Kansas' first points from a player other than Dickinson came when Harris drilled two free throws to tie the game 10. Following a pullup jumper from Jeremy Fears Jr. that gave the Spartans an 18-16 lead, Flory Bidunga's dunk tied the game before Dickinson knocked down the game's first 3-pointer to put the Jayhawks back in front. Bidunga dunked again to force a Michigan State timeout with Kansas up 23-18 with 3:20 left before halftime. Jase Richardson's layup then cut Michigan State's deficit to three, but Griffen answered with a mid-range jumper before David Coit's triple and another Bidunga slam gave Kansas its largest lead at 30-20 with 10 seconds left in the first half. Richardson was fouled when he connected on the Spartans' first 3-pointer of the game and made the ensuing free throw to trim the Jayhawks' lead to 30-24 entering halftime. Michigan State pulled even at 39 after Kohler's three-point play with 14:04 left.  --Jack Batten, Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Four of the top five teams reside in the Big Ten, with Oregon joined by No. 2 Ohio State, No. 4 Penn State and No. 5 Indiana in the second rankings reveal of the season. Texas moved into the No. 3 spot. Losses last week by Georgia, Miami (Fla.) and LSU assured a major shuffle from the initial 2024 playoff rankings revealed seven days earlier. Texas (8-1, 4-1 SEC) and Tennessee (8-1, 5-1) climbed to third and seventh, respectively. BYU remained undefeated and slid up to No. 6, while Oregon (10-0, 7-0 Big Ten) and Indiana (10-0, 7-0) are surprising flag-bearers for the Big Ten with two weeks remaining in the regular season. After the Hoosiers handled Michigan last week, they reached the bye week with an extra seven days to prepare for a visit to the Horseshoe to take on Ohio State (9-1). Oregon defeated Ohio State 32-31 on Oct. 12. A 12-team playoff debuts in December, opening the door to eight additional teams compared to the previous CFP bracket. Whereas even SEC teams with two losses would be all but eliminated from the original four-team playoff, No. 10 Alabama (7-2), No. 11 Ole Miss (8-2), No. 13 Georgia (7-2) and No. 15 Texas A&M (7-2) maintain a fighting chance to break into the 12-team bracket behind the current one-loss SEC teams. In the midst of the program's first 10-win season, Indiana first-year coach Frank Cignetti is attempting to author a season for the books. He said he realized quickly upon taking the job he was encountering a somber or defeated aura around the football program and vowed to shift it instantly. History sides with the Buckeyes, who play Northwestern at Wrigley Field on Saturday. Ohio State has won 29 consecutive games against Indiana with an average margin of victory of 37 points. The last win for the Hoosiers in the series was in 1988. Ohio State delivered Penn State its only loss this season, 20-13 on Nov. 2. The Nittany Lions are clear of their biggest regular-season obstacles on the schedule with trips to Purdue, Minnesota and a home game against Maryland left to play. A variable without a precise measure at the moment is how the CFP committee reconciles head-to-head carnage in power conferences. The answer should become more telling in future rankings. Georgia handed Texas its only loss but lost to Alabama and Ole Miss. The Longhorns still have a matchup with A&M on Nov. 30. Tennessee beat Alabama and visits Athens to challenge Georgia in one of the marquee matchups Saturday. Notre Dame (8-1) rides a seven-game winning streak into Saturday's game against Virginia before a potential playoff elimination game Nov. 23 with No. 24 Army (9-0, 7-0 American Athletic Conference) at Yankee Stadium. The Black Knights are 9-0 for the first time since 1996. Notre Dame lost to Northern Illinois 16-14 on Sept. 7. Miami (Fla.) lost to Georgia Tech 28-23 last week and dropped to No. 9 in the rankings. The Hurricanes missed the chance to surge ahead in the rankings and are now square with No. 14 SMU (8-1), but the Mustangs are the only undefeated team (5-0) in conference play and lost to BYU head-to-head on Sept. 6. An expanded playoff field could mean room for underdogs from outside the Power 4 conferences. Boise State (7-1, 4-0 Mountain West) remained at No. 12 in this week's rankings and shares the lead in the Mountain West with Colorado State. Powered by Heisman Trophy candidate running back Ashton Jeanty -- the FBS leader in rushing yards (1,525), rushing touchdowns (20), total touchdowns (21) and all-purpose yards (1,606) -- the Broncos were last ranked in the CFP poll in 2019.

The Friars (3-0) erased a 30-22 halftime deficit with the help of 8-2, 7-0 and 5-0 runs to take a 42-36 lead halfway through the latter period. A 9-0 sequence put the game out of reach late.  Wesley Cardet added 10 points for the Friars, who also got six rebounds from Pierre and five assists from Joseph. Noah Farrakhan's 16 points off the bench led Hampton (1-2), which went on a 16-0 run after falling behind 8-0. Fellow reserve Trevor Smith added 11 on three triples. Cardet and Joseph hit 3-pointers to bookend the Friars' second-half spurts over 3:53 out of the break. After Tyler Rice's jumper upped the Hampton lead to 34-30, the hosts' 7-0 spurt included Corey Floyd's putback following two offensive boards and a Joseph catch-and-shoot triple.  Ryan Mela's coast-to-coast layup closed the 6-0 spurt by the halfway mark, only to have Hampton's Richard Goods and Smith hitting their first threes to tie the game with 9:03 left.  A minute after Richard Barron's left-corner three, Floyd scored the next two Providence baskets. His running dunk with 5:43 left gave Providence a 49-47 lead it would not relinquish. Another Cardet three and key free throws by Joseph iced the game.  Providence was only 10-of-20 at the foul line, but four of its makes came in the final 40 seconds. In the first half, Pierre's 3-pointers on each side of Oswin Erhunmwunse's dunk spurred the opening run in 5:47. Rice's mid-range jumper at 13:50 not only broke Hampton's scoring drought but also spurred a 16-0 run over seven-plus minutes. Six of Providence's nine first-half turnovers came during that span. Farrakhan was at the center of the turnaround with nine of the last 14 points in that span, including three free throws on one trip and a free-throw line jumper at 7:01. Barron hit the first of three 3-pointers in 2:09 to close within 20-17 before a 10-5 Pirates run ended the period. Benefitting from a Barron flagrant foul, Xzavier Long drained two free throws and a 3-pointer on the ensuing possession.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Carolina is 9-1-0 in its last 10 games. The only blip in that stretch was a 6-4 loss to the Colorado Avalanche on Saturday in the first game of the Hurricanes' three-game road trip, but Carolina bounced back strongly in Monday's 5-2 win over the Vegas Golden Knights. Nine different Hurricanes collected at least one point against the Knights, as Carolina became the first team this season to score a road victory in Las Vegas. ""Every line is contributing ... Every team that I've been a part of here, depth has always been our strong suit,"" said Hurricanes forward Jordan Martinook, who is on a four-game scoring streak (five goals, one assist). ""Obviously, we're showing it at the beginning of the year and we're going to need to continue that throughout the rest of the year. When everybody is chipping in, it's easy and a lot of fun."" This roster-wide production has resulted in at least four goals scored in each of Carolina's last nine games. The Hurricanes are two games away from tying their franchise record for the most consecutive games with four or more goals. Martin Necas has emerged as the focal point of the well-rounded attack. Necas is among the NHL's leaders with 24 points, with 21 of those points (seven goals, 14 assists) coming over the forward's ongoing 10-game points streak. In contrast, Utah players collectively amassed only 19 points over the team's four-game road trip, resulting in a 1-2-1 record and two shutout losses. The Utah Hockey Club outshot the Nashville Predators by a 27-21 margin on Saturday but allowed two power-play goals and an empty-netter in a 4-0 loss. ""I think defensively we played good enough, but ... we need a way to generate more offense without sacrificing our defense. That's urgent for us,"" Utah coach Andre Tourigny said. Avoiding the penalty box would be a good start, as Utah ranked among the league leaders in penalty minutes (174) entering Tuesday. On the other side of the special teams coin, Utah is 0-for-8 on the power play in its last four games, and 2-for-26 with the extra attacker in its last 10 games. After a 4-1-1 start, the Utah Hockey Club are only 2-5-2 in their last nine games. Clayton Keller leads Utah skaters with 13 points (six goals, seven assists). Nick Schmaltz is second on the team with 12 points all from assists, as Schmaltz has yet to score in 15 games this season. Connor Ingram remains Utah's top goaltender, though backup Karel Vejmelka could get more action if Ingram can't turn things around. Ingram has only a 3.40 goals-against average this season in 12 starts. Pyotr Kochetkov is expected to start again in Carolina's net, and has thrived with an increase in playing time. With Frederik Andersen recovering from a lower-body injury, Kochetkov is 7-0-0 with a 2.28 GAA in his last seven games. The Utah Hockey Club are 3-2-1 on home ice this season. The Hurricanes have been one of the NHL's best road teams, posting a 6-2-0 away record. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Vanderbilt comes off Sunday's 85-76 win over Southeast Missouri State, while the Bears (making their first road trip) beat Cal Poly 91-73 last Thursday. As expected under new coach Mark Byington, the Commodores have played fast (36th nationally in average possession length, according to KenPom.com), spread out the playing time (nine players average at least 16 minutes, but none more than 27.5) and shot a lot of 3-pointers (59). What was unexpected: Vanderbilt ranks 345th nationally in 3-point percentage at just 18.6 percent. Six-foot-7 Boston College transfer Devin McGlockton (19.0 ppg, 16.0 rpg, 3.0 bpg) has registered double-doubles in both contests while shooting 73.7 percent from the floor. ""I feel like we still have a lot to prove and we'll prove them wrong,"" McGlockton said. ""I've been playing center my whole life, four and five, so I'm pretty comfortable there and especially against taller and slower defenders I feel like I have an advantage."" Reserve guard Tyler Tanner has also been a nice surprise. He leads all freshmen nationally with seven steals. As for Cal, a pair of backcourt transfers -- Jovan Blacksher Jr. (17.5 ppg, 3.5 rpg) and Andrej Stojakovic (15.5 ppg, 6.0 rpg) -- make the Bears go. Blacksher is the team's best 3-point shooter, canning 50 percent of a team-high 14 tries, while Stojakovic has led the team at the foul line (12-of-14 shooting). The Bears fell in an early 17-5 hole against a fast-paced Cal Poly team last time out, something they'll not want to repeat against a Vanderbilt team that also prefers a quickened pace. ""We got off to a slow start defensively,"" coach Mark Madsen said after that game. ""I had to burn a timeout. I got after the guys and they really responded. I was incredibly proud of our players for the response to Cal Poly just coming out and absolutely blitzing us from the start of the game."" It'll be a reunion for several people on both sides. Cal's Mady Sissoko (6.5 ppg, 5.5 rpg) and Vanderbilt's A.J. Hoggard (11 points, four assists in his season debut vs. SEMO) played together at Michigan State the previous four seasons. Associate head coach Adam Mazarei spent 2019-23 at Vanderbilt before leaving for Cal last season. Joining Cal this season is Lee Dort (6.0 ppg, 8.5 rpg), who spent his previous two seasons at Vanderbilt, where he logged 118 minutes over 18 games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Seton Hall's first two games with an overhauled roster have not been as fruitful. Seton Hall will look to bounce back from a stunning defeat and Hofstra will aim to remain perfect Wednesday night, when the teams meet in the second game of the ""Icons of the Game"" doubleheader at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y. Seton Hall has been off since Saturday, when the Pirates suffered a 57-56 loss to visiting Fordham in South Orange, N.J. Hofstra last played Friday, when the host Pride beat Iona 90-76 in Hempstead, N.Y. Fordham's Jackie Johnson III sank a floater at the buzzer to hand Seton Hall (1-1) its first nonconference regular-season loss at the on-campus Walsh Gymnasium since 1989. But it was the second straight frustrating outing for the Pirates, who return just three scholarship players -- starting guard Dylan Addae-Wusu, forward Isaiah Coleman and little-used forward David Tubek -- and 18.7 percent of the scoring from last season's NIT champions. Seton Hall, which was picked to finish 10th in the 11-team Big East, needed to mount a second-half comeback to edge Saint Peter's 57-53 in the season opener Nov. 4. The Pirates last scored fewer than 60 points in consecutive games on March 9-10, 2022. ""Two games in a row teams outscrapped us, which is not good,"" Seton Hall head coach Shaheen Holloway said. ""That's kind of what we do. But we'll get better, we'll learn from this. And when we put it together, it'll be really good."" The adjustment process has gone smoother thus far for Hofstra (2-0), which was picked to finish fourth in the 14-team Coastal Athletic Association. The Pride, whose campus is located across the street from Nassau Coliseum, returned just 15.8 percent of the scoring from last season's 20-win squad. But the new rotation has jelled for Hofstra, which had five double-digit scorers in each of the first two games. Jaquan Sanders, who spent the previous two seasons at Seton Hall, is 10-of-21 from 3-point land while Jean Aranguren, an Iona transfer, flirted with a triple-double Friday (18 points, nine rebounds, nine assists) as the Pride led nearly wire-to-wire. ""We're still a work in progress,"" said Hofstra head coach Speedy Claxton, who played for the school from 1996-2000 before seven seasons in the NBA. ""We're getting there. We're getting there. I'm happy with where we're at right now."" This will be just the sixth all-time meeting between the schools, which are located about 50 miles apart, and the first since Seton Hall earned a 60-58 win on Dec. 31, 1970.

Now an assistant for the Red Raiders, Linder will reconvene with his former team on Wednesday when the Cowboys visit Lubbock, Texas. Linder was Wyoming's head coach for four seasons before suddenly departing in May, reportedly suggesting that the lack of name, image and likeness opportunities within the program was a major factor. He joined longtime friend Grant McCasland's staff at Texas Tech. It was later revealed that in exchange for losing Linder, Wyoming would receive a $300,000 guarantee from Texas Tech for playing one game in Lubbock this season and another one next season. Wyoming will also receive $500,000 for playing at Texas Tech in football in 2028. The Cowboys quickly found a new coach in Sundance Wicks, who was the Joe B. Hall National Coach of the Year at Green Bay last season. Having spent three seasons (2020-23) as Linder's assistant at Wyoming, Wicks said there are no hard feelings toward his former boss. ""I just love him. He's the reason why I'm here,"" Wicks told Pokes Insider. ""I'll never take that for granted. Highly grateful, will always be. I love his family. His kids are great, wife's great."" Coming off last year's 15-17 finish, the Cowboys are 2-0 this season after solid wins over Concordia-St. Paul and Tennessee State.

Atin Wright tallied 16 points in both games and leads the Mean Green in scoring. Jasper Floyd is averaging 14 points and Johnathan Massie is contributing 12.5 points and 8.0 rebounds. North Texas has never faced Minnesota but has enjoyed impressive recent success against Big Ten opponents. The Mean Green were a No. 13 seed when they notched a 78-69 first-round upset of Purdue in the 2021 NCAA Tournament for the school's first-ever March Madness victory. Then in the 2023 NIT, North Texas toppled Wisconsin 56-54 in the Final Four before beating UAB to win the title. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The 2025 pick in the deal originally belonged to the Chicago Blackhawks. Eller, 35, spent parts of seven seasons with the Capitals from 2016-23 and won a Stanley Cup with the organization in 2018. The Capitals traded him to the Colorado Avalanche before the 2023 trade deadline, and he signed with the Pittsburgh Penguins in free agency that summer. Eller has four goals and three assists in 17 games this season, his 16th in the NHL. The Denmark native has 409 points (182 goals, 227 assists) in 1,053 career games for five teams, including 208 points (87 goals, 121 assists) in 488 appearances for the Capitals. Eller added nine goals and 22 assists in 59 career playoff games with Washington, including seven goals and 11 assists over 24 games the year the Capitals won their first Stanley Cup. In a corresponding roster move, the Capitals loaned forward Mike Sgarbossa to AHL affiliate Hershey. Sgarbossa tallied one goal and one assist in three games for Washington this year. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Major League Baseball revealed the 2024 Silver Sluggers as voted on by major league managers and coaches. The group features seven first-time winners and 14 different clubs with at least one honoree. Altuve, 34, was picked as the American League second baseman winner after he batted .295 with a .789 OPS, 20 home runs, 31 doubles and 65 RBIs in 153 games in 2024. He was an All-Star for the ninth time. Betts, 32, hit .289 with an .863 OPS, 19 home runs, 24 doubles and 75 RBIs while being limited to 116 games for the World Series champion Dodgers. He picked up his eighth career All-Star nod and was named a Silver Slugger for the third year in a row. Most Valuable Player favorites Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees and Shohei Ohtani of the Dodgers predictably made the list after their respective strong seasons. Judge hammered 58 homers and 144 RBIs with a 1.159 OPS to lead the majors in all of those categories. Ohtani had career highs of 54 home runs and 130 RBIs with a 1.036 OPS; he added 59 stolen bases to become the first 50-50 player in major league history.

Xzayvier Brown shot just 4-of-18 for the Hawks (2-1) but finished with 18 points and 13 assists. Derek Simpson chipped in 16 points for St. Joe's, while Anthony Finkley made four 3-pointers en route to 12 points.   Eric Dixon registered 24 points and nine rebounds to pace the Wildcats (2-2), while Jhamir Brickus pitched in 22 points.   The game was part of the Big 5 Classic series in which the six Division I programs in the Philadelphia area compete for the city crown. St. Joe's defeated Villanova in this event last year - snapping an 11-game losing streak in the series - on its way to winning the inaugural event.   In this one, the Hawks trailed 60-59 with under seven minutes left before Brown scored six straight points, capped by a jumper with 5:09 remaining, to put St. Joe's ahead by five.   Kris Parker's 3-pointer with 3:39 left got Villanova within 67-65, but Fleming, Erik Reynolds II and Brown converted layups on the next three trips for the Hawks as the lead swelled to 73-65.   The Wildcats scored the next five points, capped by Brickus' three-point play, but Fleming scored six points in the final minute, including a jumper with 19 seconds to play to make it 79-74.   Brickus' 3-pointer gave Villanova a 29-21 edge with about five minutes left in the first half. However, St. Joseph's chipped away, inching within 37-36 on Brown's 3-pointer just before the halftime buzzer.   Early in the second half, Dixon knocked down a 3-pointer and a layup on back-to-back possessions, giving the Wildcats a 42-38 lead.

The Spurs will play the fourth game of a five-game homestand after a dominant 116-96 win over Sacramento on Monday. Victor Wembanyama led the way with a 34-point, 14-rebound double-double as San Antonio broke open a five-point halftime lead. Wembanyama's performance allowed him to become one of six players in league history to amass at least at least 1,700 points, 800 rebounds and 300 assists in his first 82 games, which is the equivalent of a full NBA regular season. Wembanyama went 6 of 12 from beyond the arc on Monday as the Spurs matched a franchise high with 22 3-pointers.  San Antonio has won two of its past three outings. ""I'm just taking better threes,"" Wembanyama said. ""Yeah, of course it's feeling better. I'm 20, I'm hoping for years it's going to keep feeling better and better. There is no reason for it to feel worse."" Spurs interim coach Mitch Johnson said Wembanyama gets his shots in during practice. ""(He) makes shots every day,"" Johnson said. ""He missed really good shots to start the year, and his recent success is just percentages evening out at this point. He is a very, very good shooter, and we want him to take the appropriate 3-pointers whenever he has the opportunity to."" Wembanyama is averaging 19.7 points and 10.5 rebounds a game this season. Julian Champagnie added 13 points for the Spurs, with Devin Vassell and Chris Paul hitting for 12 each, Keldon Johnson scoring 11 and Harrison Barnes and Stephon Castle tallying 10 apiece. Paul also had 11 assists in the win. The Wizards head to the Alamo City carrying a five-game losing streak, with their most recent clash a 107-92 defeat in Houston on Monday. Washington has lost each game during its skid by at least 13 points and by an average of nearly 20 points.  The Wizards have not won since beating visiting Atlanta on Oct. 30.

""Here's the positive: We're making them miss,"" Keefe said. ""We're making opponents miss. We're doing the first part. But part of defense is you've got to finish the possession.

Hoiberg wants to see his team improve its execution offensively and cut down on mistakes. For a coach who takes pride in having a high-scoring attack, sputtering to the extent the Cornhuskers did in their last game isn't acceptable. ""Do we put in a new system or stick to what we are doing and just do it better? A lot of it is just playing out of control and not making the right play,"" Hoiberg said. ""We have had stretches in the games we've played this season where we have played really good and we just need to be more consistent across the board."" Nebraska (2-0) won on Saturday despite hitting only 34.5 percent of its field goal attempts, including a miserable 18.2 percent (4-of-22) on 3-pointers, and committing 18 turnovers. Only the fact that the Cornhuskers made 21 of 26 shots at the foul line helped them avoid an embarrassing upset. Brice Williams has been Nebraska's top scorer so far, averaging 18.5 points per game despite shooting only 41.7 percent from the field. Meanwhile, the Knights (1-2) come in off a 96-70 loss Sunday at then-No. 15 Creighton. They managed to make only 35.8 percent of their field goals and were outmatched on the boards, giving up a 51-30 rebounding margin. Wasted in the outcome was a 19-point, eight-rebound effort from guard Terrence Brown. Through three games, Brown is averaging 20.3 points on 52.3 percent shooting from the field. His development into a go-to player doesn't surprise second-year coach Jack Castleberry. ""I think he can arguably become the best defender in this entire league and I think his jump shot is continuing to improve,"" Castleberry said. ""And he's just matured emotionally."" Dylan Jones (13.3 points per game) and Jo'el Emanuel (11.7) are also in double figures for FDU, which was picked for a third-place finish in the Northeast Conference.

That was the message from general manager Joe Schoen, who said the coaching staff and front office is ""going to evaluate everything"" during the team's bye week. Schoen spoke to reporters following Tuesday's practice, which he said was a first during a bye week in three seasons under coach Brian Daboll. ""We'll start circling up with the coaches (Wednesday) and the rest of the week and see how we can look to turn the ship as we go forward the rest of the season,"" Schoen said. The Giants are tied with Jacksonville for the worst record in the NFL and own the league's lowest scoring offense at an average of only 15.6 per game. New York has averaged only 13.4 points during the current five-game losing streak, with the latest setback being a 20-17 overtime loss to Carolina in Germany in which Jones threw for 190 yards and no touchdowns while getting intercepted twice and posting a paltry 33.8 quarterback rating. Daboll declined on Monday to commit to Jones remaining the starting quarterback coming out of the bye, and Schoen echoed that sentiment a day later. Asked multiple times whether a potential change could be impacted by finances and the guaranteed money that would kick in should Jones suffer a major injury, Schoen insisted all decisions would be driven by what helps the Giants win games. ""It will be a football decision,"" Schoen said. ""Any decisions we make moving forward as we evaluate the roster and what we're doing for the final seven games will be football decisions."" The Giants will play host to Tampa Bay on Nov. 24, and the starting quarterback could be Jones, Drew Lock or former undrafted free agent Tommy DeVito. Lock was signed as a free agent last offseason, while DeVito played in nine games as a rookie last year following Jones' season-ending knee injury. Jones has completed 63.3 percent of his passes for 2,070 yards and eight touchdowns against seven interceptions. He is in the second year of a four-year, $160 million contract. He is due to earn $30 million in base salary in 2025, with $12 million becoming fully guaranteed on the fifth day of the league season. Jones' future with the franchise has come under increased scrutiny with Daboll and Schoen acknowledging that he might not be the starter this time next week. ""We have seven games left in this season and that's what we're focused on,"" Schoen said. ""I'm focused on 2024 and how we can get better these final seven games."" Daboll and Schoen have come under scrutiny, as well, with the Giants mired at the bottom of the standings in their third seasons with the franchise. Asked if he expected to return in 2025, Schoen simply stated, ""Yes."" However, when asked to evaluate Daboll, Schoen didn't offer a direct endorsement. ""We're 2-8. So, again, we're going to look at solutions,"" Schoen said. ""He's coming in every day. He's working hard. The team is staying together. ""He's done a really good job, the guys are competing, keeping the locker room together. Again, there's a lot of things that we can look at and we need to improve on and that's what we're going to do the rest of the week."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Houston center Alperen Sengun led the way down the stretch of a 107-92 victory by doing what he'd done in the previous three periods: dominate the paint. After Washington cut what had been a 16-point deficit to 86-80, Sengun scored on three consecutive possessions to quickly get the Rockets back on track. Sengun and the Rockets will host the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday. Sengun finished Houston's second straight win with 27 points and 17 rebounds for his eighth double-double this season. He shot 12-of-19 from the floor to continue an efficient run of offensive production. Sengun has shot better than 50 percent in four of the past five games -- all Houston wins -- and is averaging 21.2 points on 57.7 percent shooting during that span. The Rockets have cultivated scoring threats from the perimeter and slashing to the rim during their protracted rebuild. But in Sengun, they have a throwback big capable of thriving on the block and providing the Rockets a sense of calm when shots aren't falling and things are a bit too frenetic. Simply getting the ball in to Sengun and letting him work has become a viable offensive tactic. ""It's a luxury I talked about last year, having Alperen to always dump it in and kind of slow down a little bit,"" Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. ""I've been around some really good scoring bigs and that settles the team all the time. ""You don't want to be just perimeter-based or relying on pick-and-roll every time. It's great to have that option."" The Clippers' four-game winning streak was snapped with a 134-128 loss to Oklahoma City on Monday, but their burgeoning cohesion on offense was again on display. Paced by Norman Powell and his team-high 31 points, five Clippers scored in double figures against the Thunder. The Clippers had at least four double-digit scorers in each of the previous four games, with Powell leading six in double figures in wins over the Spurs and Kings. Powell (team-high 26 points per game), James Harden (20.8 points, 8.4 rebounds and nine assists) and Ivica Zubac (16.9 points, 12.8 rebounds) have been offensive mainstays. The emergence of Amir Coffey and Derrick Jones Jr., averaging 13 and 12.4 points over the last five games, respectively, has rounded out the Clippers' offensive attack. The Clippers required time and game reps to settle into an offensive rhythm without Kawhi Leonard (knee) and Paul George (now with the 76ers), their top two scorers last season. That it seemed to require only 11 games for the Clippers to discover their new offensive approach bodes well for a team that appeared cloaked in uncertainty when the season commenced last month. ""We want to make sure we hit the open guy, we hit the open man and we show we're sharing the basketball,"" Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. ""We've been doing that. We're starting to make 3s, we're starting to generate more 3s, and that's how we've got to play."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""It's just that everything gets crammed into a shorter amount of time,"" Sirianni said. ""So that's what we're working through right now, is I think a lot of guys will have big bags under their eyes at the end of the week, but we've got to do what we need to do as coaches to get the guys ready."" Philadelphia certainly looked ready for a Dallas squad playing without Dak Prescott, scoring 27 unanswered points in a 34-6 victory in Arlington, Texas. Jalen Hurts overcame two turnovers with four touchdowns (two passing, two rushing) before resting in the fourth quarter with many of the starters. The defense collected five takeaways and held the Cowboys to 146 total yards of offense -- the fifth straight game that the Eagles allowed 280 or fewer yards. The Philadelphia defense enters Week 11 ranked No. 2 in the NFL in yards allowed (274.1 per game) and tied for fifth in points allowed (17.9 per game). ""We've improved as a defense, but I know we feel we have a lot more to grow,"" Eagles linebacker Nakobe Dean said. ""I don't think you ever say that you have ‘arrived' as a defense. It doesn't work that way in this league."" The Philly defense will be tested by a rookie quarterback who has ""arrived."" No. 2 overall pick Jayden Daniels has completed 68.7 percent of his passes for 2,147 yards with nine touchdowns and just two interceptions through 10 starts, adding 464 yards and four scores on the ground. The Washington offense is tied for third in the NFL in scoring (29.0 points per game) and ranks fourth with 377.0 yards per game. The Commanders let a 10-point, second-half lead slip away against the Steelers, losing on Russell Wilson's 32-yard TD pass to new teammate Mike Williams with 2:22 to play. The loss stung, but right guard Sam Cosmi wanted to make sure it didn't linger and addressed the Commanders in the locker room after the game.

There was one positive in the loss to the Rangers. The Red Wings actually had a pronounced shot advantage after being decisively outshot in most of their games this season. They had a 37-24 edge, but still could not dent New York goaltender Jonathan Quick. ""Stay with it,"" Detroit coach Derek Lalonde said of his message to the team. ""I know it sounds like a cliche but trust the process. I don't like the fact you play a game like that, and we don't have another crack at it (another game) until Wednesday. Guys will have to sit on this one for a little. ""I don't know if I've had a more frustrating hockey game while coaching for 30-plus years."" The Red Wings dominated in time in the offensive zone, hit goal posts and missed open nets. ""We definitely produced some looks and odd-man rushes,"" forward Patrick Kane said. ""Throughout the season you're going to have games like that. What we can take away is we created a lot and obviously we have to find a way to get pucks by the goalie."" Wednesday night's contest is the beginning of a four-game road trip that then takes Detroit to the West Coast with games in Anaheim, Los Angeles and San Jose. The Penguins were hammered 7-1 at home by the Dallas Stars on Monday night; they found themselves down 6-0 in the first period when they allowed six goals in a span of a little more than 16 minutes. ""They get a couple of fluky goals early in the first period, we get down that early, that many goals,"" Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. ""Thought the rest of the period, we didn't play the game the right way. We were careless with the puck. We gave them some easy looks. They turned it into an insurmountable challenge."" Joel Blomqvist gave up three goals on the first eight shots and Alex Nedeljkovic could not stop the initial two shots he faced. ""There's not much to say when it's 6-0,"" Penguins captain Sidney Crosby said. ""You just have to go play through it. You can't quit. You can't give up. We put ourselves in that situation. We've got to keep playing and see what happens. So besides that, you can't change the period. It happened. We've got to find ways to play through it."" Evgeni Malkin leads the Penguins in scoring with five goals and 13 assists for 18 points. Crosby is second with 16 points, and his six goals tie Rickard Rakell for the team lead.

The New Orleans Pelicans, meanwhile, keep absorbing injury after injury. The Pelicans and Thunder will face off Wednesday in Oklahoma City with both rotations looking drastically different from what the teams hoped for before the season. The game will be the first between the teams since Oklahoma City swept the first-round playoff series between the two last season. The latest blow to the Pelicans came Tuesday when the team announced that guard Jose Alvarado had been diagnosed with a left hamstring strain that will keep him out at least three weeks. Alvarado, who was injured in Monday's loss to Brooklyn, was already being thrust into a much bigger role than anticipated after the opening-night injury to starting point guard Dejounte Murray. ""It's tough, no doubt about it,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said of the loss of Alvarado. ""We all feel for what Jose is going through right now. We're going to miss him on the floor, his spirit. He's one of our emotional leaders."" With Murray out a few more weeks with a fractured hand and Alvarado now joining him on the sidelines, the Pelicans figure to rely even more heavily on Brandon Boston to handle the ball. Boston had 10 assists, seven rebounds, three steals and just one turnover in Monday's loss, though was just 3-of-13 shooting from the field for seven points. ""He's a bright spot, as we're going through some turbulent times,"" Green said. ""He's stepping on the floor, taking full advantage of his opportunity. You saw his passing ability (vs. Brooklyn). He didn't have the scoring game he had been having, but he's affecting the game in other ways. His ability to play defense, his rebounding, making sharp passing, getting guys wide-open shots. It was good to see him execute at a high level."" Boston, who was acquired off waivers just before the season began, has 31 assists and just six turnovers so far. The Pelicans also remain without Jordan Hawkins, Herb Jones, CJ McCollum and Zion Williamson. New Orleans has lost five consecutive games and eight of their last nine. The Thunder are coming off Monday's 134-128 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. It was Oklahoma City's first game since Sunday's injury to Chet Holmgren. Holmgren (right iliac hip fracture) is expected to miss at least two months. Though the Thunder haven't suffered injuries at the same rate as New Orleans, the injuries Oklahoma City has sustained have been focused on the interior. Isaiah Hartenstein, Jaylin Williams and Kenrich Williams have yet to play this season, and now they'll be without Holmgren for an extended period. The injuries are forcing the Thunder to play differently, relying on much smaller lineups. ""I think what they lean back on is that they're highly competitive,"" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. ""They want to win, and they're highly connected, so they're gonna do whatever it takes to win, and they're gonna do it together."" In Monday's game, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams handled much of the offensive load, combining for 73 points. ""It's just trusting each other to make extra plays, and not try to force stuff because (Holmgren is) out,"" said Jalen Williams, who is now the Thunder's de facto starting center. ""That's something that we had to do with (Hartenstein) playing."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The injury occurred in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 123-103 loss to the host Los Angeles Lakers, which was just Quickley's second game back after a pelvic injury in the season opener. Quickley will be reevaluated next week, the Raptors said. Quickley, 25, signed a five-year, $175 million contract in June, after originally joining the Raptors with RJ Barrett in the Dec. 30, 2023, trade that sent forward OG Anunoby and two others to the New York Knicks. Quickley averaged 18.6 points, 6.8 assists and 4.8 rebounds in 38 starts for Toronto following the trade, compared to 15.0 points, 2.5 assists and 2.6 boards in 30 games off the New York bench prior to the deal. In three games this season, he's averaging 15.3 points, 4.0 assists and 2.0 rebounds, though he played just 14 minutes in the season opener before leaving with the pelvic injury. A first-round pick (25th overall) in 2020, Quickley made the All-Rookie team in 2020-21 and boasts career averages of 13.7 points, 3.4 rebounds and 3.5 assists in 294 games (68 starts). He has also knocked down 600 3-pointers at a 37.5 percent clip. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

In a rematch of September's U.S. Open finals, Sinner hung on to win in an hour and 40 minutes and improved to 7-0 on indoor hard courts this year. The Italian sits atop the Ilie Nastase Group standings with one group-stage match to go. Sinner hit six aces without a double fault and saved the only break point he faced while winning 30 of 39 first-service points (76.9 percent). ""It was a very tough match,"" Sinner said. ""We got to know each other very well in a Grand Slam final. We knew exactly what to expect (Tuesday). He was very aggressive and I was prepared."" Neither player broke serve in the second set until Sinner won the 10th game to finish off the match. In the seventh game, he went down love-30 before charging back to hold serve. ""I just tried to serve very well in the important moments, which I did. That was a very crucial game in the second set, I was down 0/30. If he breaks me there, the momentum could change,"" Sinner said. Th fifth-seeded Fritz held his own, hitting seven aces without a double fault and winning 30 of 38 first-service points. But he had 31 unforced errors to Sinner's 22. Fritz is now 1-1 through two matches after he beat fourth-seeded Russian Daniil Medvedev 6-4, 6-3 on the first day of competition. Fritz and Medvedev are still vying for a berth in the four-man semifinals after Medvedev improved to 1-1 with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Australian seventh seed Alex de Minaur on Tuesday. ""I went into this match blocking the noise, even from myself,"" Medvedev said. ""I really didn't care what was happening on the court, I just tried to play, and it was a good feeling. Sometimes it's good to block it (the noise), and I did that well."" Medvedev never faced break point, winning 27 of his 32 first-service points and 11 of his 15 second-service points along the way. He converted 3 of 4 opportunities to break de Minaur and finished with a 25-9 advantage in total winners. Medvedev will face Sinner Thursday in the final day of group stage matches, while Fritz will take on de Minaur. The other group features Carlos Alcaraz of Spain, Alexander Zverev of Germany, Casper Ruud of Norway and Andrey Rublev of Russia. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Gray hopes to lead the Chanticleers to their first NCAA Tournament since 2015. Interim coach Benny Moss wasn't retained after the team finished 6-17 in the wake of Cliff Ellis' midseason retirement in December of last year. NC State returns five players but lost most of its core from a year ago. Jayden Taylor is the only returning player that started most of last season, with 29 starts in 41 games while averaging 11.2 points. Other notable returners for NC State include Ben Middlebrooks and Michael O'Connell. Middlebrooks is averaging 13.0 points and 5.5 rebounds in their first two games, up from 5.7 points in 16.3 minutes per game off the bench last season. O'Connell made 22 starts, averaging 5.7 points per game as well. ""(Middlebrooks) is an energy guy,"" NC State coach Kevin Keatts said. ""I just think he's been around college basketball for so long that he sees the ups and downs. He understands the aspect of it, never getting too high, never getting too low. ""He understands that what's important is our team winning."" NC State has six players averaging double figures in scoring over their first two games. They opened their season with a 97-66 win over USC Upstate, led by 14 points from Bowling Green transfer Marcus Hill. Middlebrooks recorded 10 points and 10 rebounds in the win. They had a tougher go-around in their second game, an 81-72 win over Presbyterian. Taylor led the way with 19 points on 7-of-14 shooting while Middlebrooks came off the bench to score 16 points. The Chanticleers split their first two games, beating Western Michigan by four in their season opener before losing to East Carolina by four. Junior college transfer Rasheed Jones has led the team in scoring in both games, averaging 17.5 points per game. ""(Jones) can make one-on-one plays,"" Gray said. ""He can play in pick and roll. He can create for others. So we have a bunch of guys that are sort of unproven, right? They have an opportunity to sort of carve out what it's gonna look like for them. ""I think it's, truthfully, one of the teams that we'll have four or five guys that'll be able to do that."" Grand Canyon transfer Noah Amenhauser, who stands at seven feet two inches, is second on the Chanticleers in scoring, averaging nine points per game off the bench. Jordan Battle and Denzel Hines are averaging eight ppg apiece, and Hines also leads the team in rebounding with seven per game. NC State guard Dennis Parker Jr. is questionable for the game with an undisclosed injury. Ismael Diouf is also questionable, pertaining to an eligibility-related suspension. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The next chance to assess that will come against South Carolina Upstate (1-2) on Wednesday night in Winston-Salem, N.C. Already, Wake Forest coach Steve Forbes sees progress. ""We felt like we had to get tougher to win these kinds of games,"" Forbes said after a 72-70 comeback victory against Michigan on Sunday. ""When you can experience that early, it helps as the season goes on."" The Demon Deacons will play Wednesday in their third home game after going to nearby Greensboro to defeat the Wolverines in a neutral-site game. The schedule can be worth savoring. ""We've got to fit them in since we start league play in early December,"" Forbes said of the nonconference outings. Wake Forest had good defensive stretches against Michigan, which didn't have a field goal in the last 3 1/2 minutes and had a scoring drought of more than five minutes in the second half. ""We turned them over 16 times, and our defense was consistent,"" Forbes said. ""You don't have to score a lot to win. You have to defend, rebound, and play tough."" Hunter Sallis had a team-high 18 points for Wake Forest, which on defense will have to pay attention to South Carolina Upstate guard Mister Dean, who has led his team in scoring in each of the first three games. He was named the Big South Conference's Freshman of the Week after averaging 19.7 points a contest. He is shooting 75.8 percent from the field this season. The Spartans will be in their third clash with an Atlantic Coast Conference team following losses at North Carolina State and Virginia Tech. They played their first three games across five days, with a rout of Piedmont in between visits to ACC sites. The early schedule is something South Carolina Upstate is embracing as well. ""That will be fun for our guys, those environments,"" coach Marty Richter said. Other positives might be brewing for Wake Forest. Freshman guard Juke Harris scored 11 points off the bench against Michigan. He was the only player in the game for either team to reach a double-figure total in the first half. ""I think you've just got to put him in and see,"" Forbes said of Harris. ""He has a lot of confidence in himself. He's still learning, but I think he's going to be a crowd favorite."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

He earned his 700th win - all at","If the measure of a college basketball coach is his number of wins, then Oakland's Greg Kampe isn't faring too badly. He earned his 700th win - all at Oakland - when the Golden Grizzlies defeated Defiance Nov. 4. If the measure of a coach is the number of people he's helped, then Kampe might be judged even more highly. Over the years, he has been one of the biggest fundraisers for Coaches vs. Cancer - and he even came to Central Illinois in April to join Illinois coach Brad Underwood for his annual event that drew 1,700 people and raised $501,649.   ""One of the great coaches in college basketball,"" Underwood said. ""One of the really good people in our profession and one of the good guys.""   On Wednesday, Kampe brings his Golden Grizzlies (1-1) to Champaign to face Underwood's Fighting Illini (2-0) for a non-conference game designed to stress Illinois' nearly all-new roster.   As Kentucky discovered in last year's NCAA Tournament, Oakland uses its zone defense and patient offense to limit possessions - and then knocks opponents out with its 3-point shooting.   ""We'll see a little different look than we did in our first two (games), which will be good for us,"" Underwood said. ""They gave us everything that we wanted last year.""   Indeed, Oakland showed up in Champaign last Nov. 10 and owned the lead with 10 minutes to play before falling to the Elite Eight-bound Illini by a 64-53 count.   While Illinois doesn't have any of its starters back from last year - guard Ty Rodgers has elected to redshirt this season - Oakland isn't much different. Senior point guard DQ Cole is the only returning starter currently playing.   With Kentucky killer Jack Gohlke and Blake Lampman having graduated, Cole has risen to become Oakland's top 3-point threat. He launched 15 3-pointers when Oakland played last Wednesday at Boise State. Alas, he made just one as Boise State cruised to an 87-43 win.   The Golden Grizzlies shot 3 of 26 from 3-point range as a team at Boise, which obviously can't repeat Wednesday if Oakland intends to knock off Illinois. But Kampe doesn't apologize for a non-conference schedule that also includes trips to Kansas and Arkansas along with a ""neutral"" game against Michigan State in Detroit.   ""I know a lot of our fans don't like hearing this,"" Kampe said. ""But, again, I say, we could play some really crappy teams. A lot of things would be different, but we wouldn't know how bad we were. We wouldn't know what we have to do to improve and get ready so we can compete for a conference championship. I like our team. We have a chance."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

No one was injured in the incident, and none of those involved chose to press charges. When the police searched Franco's Mercedes-Benz at the time of the altercation, they found a Glock with its magazine and 15 rounds of ammunition but no registration papers. The gun was registered to a man Franco said is his uncle. The weapons charges could result in a maximum of sentence of 3-5 years and a fine. Franco was reportedly being held for questioning but is expected to be released while awaiting trial, though no bail terms or court dates were announced. Franco, 23, is already on indefinite administrative leave from Major League Baseball as he awaits trial on charges involving the sexual abuse of a minor. Under his bail agreement, Franco is not allowed to leave the Dominican Republic but is free to travel within the country as he awaits a Dec. 12 trial.

Godwin suffered a dislocated left ankle in the Ravens' 41-31 victory over the Bucs on Oct. 21. Per reports, the NFL ruled Smith brought down the receiver with an illegal hip-drop tackle. Smith, 27, was not penalized for the hit during the game but was later fined $16,833 for unnecessary roughness, which the two-time All-Pro appealed. Godwin, who is set to become a free agent in 2025, had seven receptions for 65 yards in the Week 7 game prior to the injury that occurred with less than a minute to play. At the time, Godwin had an NFL-leading 50 catches for 576 yards -- third most in the league at the time -- and five touchdowns in seven games. The Bucs placed Godwin on injured reserve on Oct. 23, and he underwent surgery on the dislocated ankle the next day.

Arkansas (1-1) lost to then-No. 8 Baylor 72-67 on Saturday after beating Lipscomb 76-60 in the season opener on Nov. 6. Arkansas and Troy are near mirror images on defense, with the Razorbacks throwing a variety of full-court presses at opponents to speed up the game. Troy guards in the full court as well and will even press after an opponent's miss. ""We have to make the game a rock fight,"" Troy coach Scott Cross said.

They have 100 combined starts on their roster from seven players, and 10 players have combined for 262 games played. ""There's not a lot of difference between starters and backups,"" said Cross, whose team was picked to finish third in the preseason Sun Belt Conference poll. ""I could have 100 million different starting combinations. The guys starting in there have been around the program and know what we want. But we have complete confidence in all our guys."" Jackson Fields leads four Trojans who average double figures in scoring with 12.5 points per game and a team-high 7.0 rebounds per contest. Tayton Conerway and Thomas Dowd each average 11.5 points, and Myles Rigsby is at 11.0. Similarities don't extend into roster construction, however. It's the first season at the helm of the Arkansas program for John Calipari, and the Hall of Fame coach has 13 newcomers -- seven transfers and six freshmen. Freshman guard Boogie Fland has lived up to his billing as a five-star recruit and leads Arkansas with an average of 17 points per game. Adou Thiero is coming off a monster game against Baylor in which he scored a game-high 24 points with six rebounds, two assists, two blocks and a steal. ""(Thiero) is in attack mode now,"" Calipari said. ""Instead of messing with the ball, he's in attack mode. Now he can get to where he needs to go.

Even though Arkansas enters Wednesday's game off a hard-fought loss, it's the type of challenge Calipari wants the Razorbacks to face early in the season as they prepare for Southeastern Conference play. ""You could play a team and try to win by 50,"" Calipari said. ""And what you learn is that you can beat that kind of team by 50. ""This (loss to Baylor) showed us some good stuff.

Fresh off a 74-69 upset Saturday night against then-ranked No. 4 Houston, Auburn coach Bruce Pearl was pleased with how his team responded through adversity after the team flight the day before had to be rescheduled due to a mid-air physical altercation between two Tiger reserve players, reported to be forwards Jahki Howard and Ja'Heim Hudson. The chartered flight took off from Auburn University Regional Airport for Houston at 2:40 on Friday afternoon but was diverted back to the airport about an hour later, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. In audio obtained by CBS, the plane's pilot can be heard telling air traffic controllers that two players ""got into a physical alteration"" and that ""clothes were ripped.""  Neither Howard nor Hudson made the trip to Houston, but the Tigers overcame the altercation to post the upset. And Pearl was happy with the victory in what he called a ""physical"" game, in which the teams tied in rebounds at 33. ""It was outstanding,"" Pearl said. ""Let me tell you what I love about the game -- student-athletes, pay attention: That was as physical of a game as we're going to play. There wasn't one ounce of animosity, unsportsmanlike conduct, nothing.  ""Those guys [Houston] expected to get checked out, and our guys expected to get screens ... it would be like playing Bobby Knight or playing Indiana. You know what you're going to get. You know, when you're playing a Bobby Knight team, they may talk a little less (expletive), but you know what you're going to get."" While Pearl offered no immediate comment about his team's player altercation, attention quickly shifted toward the on-court action. The Tigers (2-0) were led by Tahaad Pettiford's 21 points, 15 of those coming in the second half to pull away from the Cougars late. Auburn's Johni Broome, who finished with 20 points, said the victory over Houston overcame the mid-air incident. ""You know, stuff happens,"" Broome said, per CBS. ""But at the end of the day, we came here to play basketball. Everybody was locked in with each other. We were our brother's keeper. We have a strong family here, and we came out here and won that basketball game."" Pearl described the game's atmosphere as a March-type feel in November, which he expects his team to endure throughout a non-conference schedule that will see Auburn play No. 7 Iowa State, No. 6 Duke, No. 21 Ohio State and No. 13 Purdue, as currently ranked, before Christmas. However, before getting to those games, the Tigers will take on the Golden Flashes (2-0), who have yet to play a power-conference opponent this season.

Back in the Top 25 for the first time since January 2019, the 22nd-ranked Red Storm will host Wagner on Wednesday night in Queens, N.Y., for another tune-up before the schedule gets tougher. St. John's (2-0) opened Pitino's second season with eight newcomers and posted a pair of blowout victories. The Red Storm started with a 92-60 win over Fordham on Nov. 4 but were sluggish in the opening minutes. Then St. John's was threatened even more in Saturday's 96-73 win over Quinnipiac. The Red Storm trailed by four at halftime against the preseason favorite from the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference but then shot 52.6 percent in a 61-point second half. ""Sometimes you get what you deserve,"" Pitino said. ""We had two of the worst practices that we've had all season. I told them it's going to bite you in the behind if you practice like that, and it did."" Ultimately, talent won out, and it is a scenario Pitino hopes to avoid again, especially since St. John's will host New Mexico on Sunday at Madison Square Garden and will face No. 12 Baylor next week in a tournament in the Bahamas with a field that includes No. 11 Tennessee and Virginia. While R.J. Luis led St. John's with 24 points and 13 rebounds vs. Quinnipiac, two other players continued their strong starts. Simeon Wilcher followed his 17 points against Fordham with 14 on Saturday, and Brady Dunlap finished with a career-high 20 in that matchup. ""Going into today's game, we had a couple of rough practices, so coach got into us at the start, but at the end he was like we just got to bounce back,"" Dunlap said. The Red Storm also won decisively without standout defensive player Aaron Scott, who is expected to return from an illness on Wednesday. Wagner (1-1) will play its second game against a ranked opponent and the first of three games against a Big East foe. After shooting 34.9 percent from the field in its season-opening 75-52 loss at then-No. 25 Rutgers on Nov. 6, the Seahawks cruised to a 94-52 rout Saturday of Manor College, a team from the National Junior College Athletic Association. Ja'Kair Sanchez, a Division II transfer, scored 17 points to lead five in double figures. Tyje Kelton added 15 as the Seahawks scored 48 by halftime and were 15 of 29 from 3-point range. ""I'm glad to come out with a win. I'm glad we played in spurts potentially how we could,"" Wagner coach Donald Copeland said. ""Probably still a long way from where we need to be, but it was good to get in the win column."" St. John's leads the all-time series 19-2, and the schools will meet for the first time since November 2019. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Especially on defense. In their most recent game, the Volunteers dominated Louisville 77-55 on Saturday to improve to 2-0.   A key player in the victory was Jahmai Mashack, who scored only three points but grabbed seven rebounds in displaying his versatility as a defender.  Mashack also tallied three steals to help lead Tennessee's strong effort. ""I mean, he was just dominant,"" Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said of Mashack. ""And he does all the things that go into winning. And his effort was great. I thought everyone's effort defensively was there."" Tennessee forced Louisville to shoot only 26.7 percent from the field, and opponents are shooting only 34.8 percent against the Vols this season. Offensively, Tennessee has shown how dangerous it can be, especially with veteran guards Zakai Zeigler and Chaz Lanier leading the way. Zeigler scored 19 in the win over the host Cardinals, including 11 in the final 13 minutes, and is averaging 16.0 points per outing. Lanier, a fifth-year standout, leads the team at 18.5 points per game. He scored a season-best 19 against Louisville. Felix Okpara also scored in double figures, chipping in 10 points. Lanier told reporters after the game that the fact that Tennessee played so well on the road in a tough environment is huge for the program moving forward as it aims to contend for a title this season. ""It's just toughness,"" Lanier said. ""Bottom line is it just shows how tough we are."" Montana (2-1) dominated Northwest Indian College 94-44 on Sunday but now will face its biggest test of the year so far as it goes on the road to face a Southeastern Conference opponent. The Grizzlies allowed their fewest points since 2021 in Sunday's win and had a 50-26 rebounding advantage. Nine players scored for Montana, including Kai Johnson, who contributed a team-high 22 points. He is averaging a team-best 16.3 per game this season. The Grizzlies will face their second Power Five school of the year after losing 79-48 to Oregon in their opener on Nov. 8. Montana is feeling good about its direction but knows it's far from the team it wants to be at this point in the season. ""We've had a lot of guys in and out,"" Grizzlies coach Travis DeCuire said. ""We've had multiple guys miss a lot of practices. I think we're looking at three guys in the rotation that have missed 10 or more practices. For chemistry, for flow, that's playing a bit into where we're a little behind where we want to be right now."" Matching the Volunteers won't be easy, especially with Tennessee's ability to knock down 3-point shots in addition to the team's defensive toughness.  The Vols made 10 3-pointers against Louisville -- out of 19 attempts -- and have connected 18 times from 3-point range this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Kalkbrenner, the Big East preseason player of the year, followed his career-high 49-point performance in the season opener against Texas Rio Grande Valley with 24 points in 22 minutes in the Bluejays' 96-70 victory over Fairleigh Dickinson on Sunday.  The fifth-year senior has made a staggering 90.6 percent (29 of 32) of his shots from the floor for Creighton (2-0).  For his efforts, Kalkbrenner was named the Big East Player of the Week on Monday for the first time in his career.  Steven Ashworth drained five 3-pointers to highlight his 15-point performance vs. Fairleigh Dickinson. Arizona State transfer Jamiya Neal scored 13 points and Texas Tech transfer Pop Isaacs added 12 on Sunday in his debut. Those strong performances -- along with a 36-8 run that spanned from the end of the first half into the start of the second -- allowed Creighton to pull away from Fairleigh Dickinson.  ""Stops (are) the biggest thing,"" Ashworth said, per the Omaha World-Herald. ""If we can string together a few stops in a row, it really puts pressure on the other team's defense to get back in transition, then guard us.""  Neal provided exclamation points with emphatic slams on Sunday. ""I think that's where I thrive the most,"" he said. ""I like to play in (transition) as much as possible. If I can get in those types of situations, I want to get that.""  Isaacs is still working out the kinks as he looks to rediscover his game following a torn hip labrum.  ""His timing and rhythm is not gonna be great, but it was good to have him out there and hopefully work some of those kinks out while continuing to feel a little bit better,"" Bluejays coach Greg McDermott said. Should Kalkbrenner and company hit on all cylinders on Wednesday, that likely would allow McDermott to etch his name in the team's record books. McDermott and Dana Altman (1994-2010) are tied with a program-best 327 wins. McDermott credited his team's defense for stepping up after he challenged his charges following the season opener.  ""Certainly a step in the right direction,"" McDermott said. ""That's what it's about this time of year, just trying to get a little bit better as we move day to day.""

You didn’t spend six hours a day watching basketball last week? Maybe it was just me. College hoops season is back in full force. November games may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but if you chose to watch election coverage instead of unwinding with some BYU vs. Central Arkansas, that’s on you. In case you missed it, here are 10 things to know about the first week of the season. Granted, it’s been a few seasons since Gonzaga earned a No. 1 seed or had a recognizable star like Drew Timme. But you’d better learn the names Ryan Nembhard, Graham Ike and Nolan Hickman, because the Bulldogs will be a national contender once more. They dusted No. 8 Baylor 101-63 on opening night and beat Arizona State on Sunday, shooting at least 50 percent both times. The wildest story of the weekend was the news that Auburn’s initial flight to Houston for a game against the Cougars had to turn around because two reserve players got into a fight. Who needs them? Freshman Tahaad Pettiford bombed in five threes, and the 11th-ranked Tigers outscored Houston 46-36 in the second half of Saturday’s win. Auburn is Kenpom.com’s No. 1 team after one week, which helps dull the pain the football team is causing them down there. After feeling slighted (and rightfully so) that the Big East got only three NCAA Tournament bids last March, league officials were hoping for better days in 2024-25. In one week, Villanova lost to Columbia, Butler lost to Austin Peay and Seton Hall lost to Fordham. I love the Big East, but even I have to admit this is a rough start. The Huskies’ goal of a national three-peat could be achievable. Alex Karaban, the lone returning starter from last year’s champions, has led UConn in scoring through two games and freshman Liam McNeeley had double-doubles in each contest. I’m looking forward to UConn’s three-game stretch against Baylor, Texas and Gonzaga in December. Staying in the Big East for a moment, it would be lazy of me to dub him “the next Zach Edey,” but that’s who Creighton 7-footer Ryan Kalkbrenner will remind casual college hoops fans of. A three-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year, Kalkbrenner put up a ridiculous 20-of-22 shooting performance for 49 points in the Bluejays’ season opener against UT Rio Grande Valley. He’s 3-for-3 from behind the arc through two games. Dangerous player. Duke has the No. 1 freshman in this year’s class, Cooper Flagg, a name you’ve surely heard by now and the favorite ahead of Kalkbrenner and others for the Wooden Award. Through two games, Duke’s leading scorer and top shooter is… Kon Knueppel, another freshman who’s thriving on Tobacco Road despite having one of the most Wisconsin names and faces of all time. The end of Kansas’ 2023-24 season was nearly unwatchable, so Jayhawks fans will take the progress shown in a 92-89 win over North Carolina, even if that game included a blown 20-point lead. It’s early. Everyone’s still figuring things out. Transfers Zeke Mayo and AJ Storr look to be crucial for making Kansas a deeper, better version of itself this year. Arkansas fans are unhappy about the first loss of the John Calipari era, but it came by five points to a higher-ranked Baylor team and freshman Boogie Fland is off to a great start. Calipari’s old Kentucky home racked up 103 and 100 points against two outmatched opponents, but a big test is waiting this Tuesday against Duke. The outside shooting in that game could be phenomenal. St. John’s dusted Fordham and Quinnipiac, the latter the preseason favorite in the MAAC, and ran up the score in the second half both times. When one guard (Kadary Richmond) is off his game on offense, another (RJ Luis Jr., Simeon Wilcher, Deivon Smith) seems primed to take over. Rick Pitino probably isn’t going to call this team unathletic anytime soon. The Ospreys of the Atlantic Sun Conference are 3-0 with two big upsets on their ledger. After taking down South Carolina on opening night, they beat Georgia Tech 105-93(!) on Sunday. It’s a wonderful surprise from longtime coach Matthew Driscoll, whose previous claim to fame was the guy who screamed “Let’s go!” for too long and got turned into a gif. Copyright 2024"

St. Peter, in turn, will transition from president and CEO to the role of strategic adviser when these moves take effect in the first quarter of 2025.  Also Tuesday, vice president/assistant general manager Jeremy Zoll was promoted to senior vice president/general manager, effective immediately.  These moves were approved by Twins control owner Jim Pohlad and club executive chair Joe Pohlad. The Pohlad family has owned the franchise since 1984 but recently started exploring the possibility of a sale. ""I am incredibly honored and excited to take on these expanded responsibilities, and I'm deeply grateful to Jim, Joe and the entire Pohlad family for their trust and support as we move forward,"" said Falvey, who was hired in October 2016 to succeed Terry Ryan.  ""Working alongside such a thoughtful ownership family and an exceptional leadership team is a privilege I don't take lightly.""   St. Peter, 57, joined the organization as an intern in 1990 and elevated to the role of president in November 2002.  ""Since joining the Twins in 1990, I've always felt it was a privilege to work for this franchise and serve this fanbase,"" St. Peter said. ""That sense of responsibility drives me every day and fuels a relentless effort to make Twins baseball better. I am incredibly proud of our organization's continued growth, enhanced impact on our community and the positive development of our people. Never have we had more collective talent across the Twins organization and that foundation will lead to an even brighter future.""

Faust coached the Fighting Irish to a 30-26-1 record from 1981-85, hired straight from Archbishop Moeller High School in Cincinnati, which he had built into a powerhouse from the ground up as its first football coach. His tenure at Notre Dame was sandwiched between those of Dan Devine and Lou Holtz, both of whom won national championships at the school, but Faust's teams never reached such heights. His 1981 team was 5-6 -- the first sub-.500 season for Notre Dame since 1963. The team never exceeded seven wins during his tenure, and he resigned after another 5-6 season in 1985. ""What I say about Coach Faust is you won't find a guy who loved a school more, wanted to win more,"" former running back Allen Pinkett told the South Bend Tribune in June 2023. ""He just didn't know how to do it, and it was kind of unfair to him to bring him straight from high school. The thing was, we had so much talent, but I think my best year we won seven games. It was so unfortunate."" Faust's teams at Moeller were 178-23-2, and he returned to Ohio as the head coach at Akron, posting a 43-53-3 record. Moeller players will wear a helmet decal honoring Faust in their state semifinal game Friday night. His family said Faust also left behind a legacy with the players he coached. ""Throughout an extraordinary life driven by an unwavering and deep devotion to his Catholic faith, he was a beloved mentor to countless young men both on and off the playing field,"" his family's statement said. ""His work ethic, optimism, leadership and humility were legendary. He leaves behind a legacy of perseverance, compassion, and inspiration, reminding us all of the extraordinary impact one life can have."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

As part of the shakeup, offensive coordinator Shane Waldron was fired on Tuesday. Waldron received a vote of confidence eight days ago after a lopsided 29-9 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, but head coach Matt Eberflus indicated he was resigned to change on Monday.  ""After evaluating our entire operation, I decided that it is in the best interest of our team to move in a different direction with the leadership of our offense,"" Eberflus said in a statement released by the team. ""This decision was well-thought-out, one that was conducted deliberately and respectfully. I would like to thank Shane for his efforts and wish him the best moving forward."" Eberflus selected Waldron as offensive coordinator from a pool that included former Cardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury. Eberflus was retained as head coach by general manager Ryan Poles in January following a 7-10 season. The present situation isn't entirely unfamiliar to Brown. He is being bumped into the primary play-calling role for the second consecutive season. In 2023, the 38-year-old was promoted by the Carolina Panthers with embattled coach Frank Reich giving Brown the call sheet in an effort to spare his own job and pump life into their rookie No. 1 pick at quarterback, Bryce Young.  The Bears are in a bind with the Packers (6-3) up next as confidence and production bottom out on the heels of three consecutive losses and a three-game streak during which rookie No. 1 pick Caleb Williams has zero touchdown passes.  Eberflus said Monday that Williams was safe as the starting quarterback but pointed to imminent changes around the rookie. Williams and the Bears were dominated by the New England Patriots (3-7) on Sunday. They carry a run of 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown into Week 11 trying to keep pace with the rest of the NFC North. Eberflus is 0-4 against Green Bay in his first two seasons as Bears head coach and will see the Packers, Lions (8-1) and Vikings (7-2) twice in the final two months of the season.  The Bears have 27 total points during a three-game slide that began with rookie Jayden Daniels' 52-yard, game-winning Hail Mary on Oct. 27.  Chicago produced three points against the Patriots, putting up fewer than 17 points for the fifth time this season. New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Brown, a former NFL running back who broke into coaching under Sean McVay with the Rams, spent nine seasons on college football staffs including three years as Miami (Fla.) running backs coach and offensive coordinator.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Owner Jerry Jones said Prescott is set for surgery Wednesday in New York. Jones said on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas that quarterback Cooper Rush will start Monday's game against the visiting Houston Texans. Trey Lance will serve as the backup while the team is expected to add fellow quarterback Will Grier to the practice squad. Jones provided optimistic news on Prescott having his surgery in New York. ""He had a good visit last night and he wants to do that there, and he's got great medical doctors up there,"" Jones said. ""His prognosis is wonderful, it just means we're not going to have him the rest of the year."" Signed to a four-year, $240 million contract extension in September that made him the highest-paid quarterback in NFL history, Prescott threw for 1,978 yards with 11 touchdowns and eight interceptions in eight games this season.  Prescott, 31, led the NFL in completions (410) and touchdowns (36) last season. He threw for 4,516 yards in 17 games as Dallas finished the regular season 12-5. A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Prescott owns a 76-46 record in 122 career starts since being picked by Dallas in the fourth round of the 2016 NFL Draft. He has thrown for 31,437 yards with 213 touchdowns and 82 interceptions. Rush flopped in his first start of the season on Sunday, one week after Prescott sustained his injury during the third quarter of a 27-21 loss to the Atlanta Falcons.  Rush completed 13 of 26 passes for 45 yards and lost two fumbles as Dallas dropped its fourth straight game, a 34-6 setback to the Philadelphia Eagles.  Rush was replaced in the fourth quarter by Lance, who went 4-for-6 for 21 yards with an interception in his first regular-season action since being acquired by the Cowboys in 2023.   But the Cowboys (3-6) are turning back to Rush for the Monday night game against the Texans (6-4). ""Because Cooper has shown that he has the capability to compete and win games,"" Jones said. ""And he does give us our best chance. Frankly that was really an out-of-character game for him based on what we've seen.""  Rush, 30, has completed 35 of 62 passes for 212 yards and a touchdown in parts of five games this season.  He has completed 59.7 percent of his passes for 1,831 yards with nine touchdowns and six interceptions in 31 career games (seven starts) with Dallas. Grier, 29, had been with the Cowboys in 2021-22 before being released prior to the 2023 season. He completed 28 of 52 passes for 228 yards in two starts during the 2019 season with the Carolina Panthers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Anybody that gladly took them up on the offer in a game against the Miami Dolphins ended up with indigestion. It was the offense that was supposed to carry the Rams into a new era, but Los Angeles head coach Sean McVay couldn’t get his group over the line in a 23-15 loss Monday. With a fourth consecutive victory there for the taking, the Rams did not score a touchdown behind quarterback Matthew Stafford. Any ideas of rallying from a dreadful 1-4 start and into the playoffs have been put on pause with the current 4-5 record. Stafford has played 50 regular-season games with the Rams. He has now failed to orchestrate a touchdown drive in just two of them. “It was a little bit of this and a little bit of that,” Stafford said of the team’s issues on offense. “We did some really good things and weren’t good enough in some areas. I would say that we were inconsistent.” The Rams were supposed to be about the offense this season, and if anybody wondered why, they just needed to look toward the stands Monday. All-superhero defensive tackle Aaron Donald was in attendance to watch his former teammates, looking as chiseled as ever in retirement. A young Los Angeles defense was supposed to go through growing pains this season, and the offense, filled with elite skill players, was set to move things forward. Well, if Donald was impressed with any group, it was with his former defense. Miami won with just 238 yards of total offense, well below the Rams’ 327 yards. The Dolphins got the job done despite just 208 yards passing and an interception from Tua Tagovailoa. So while the Rams have Stafford, wide receivers Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp and running back Kyren Williams, there is a new group of players looking for top billing. Edge rusher Byron Young and defensive tackle Kobie Turner played as rookies alongside Donald in his final season. Edge rusher Jared Verse and defensive tackle Braden Fiske were drafted after Donald announced that his playing days were done. The Rams already had a Fearsome Foursome in the 1960s, and while this base defense is not the same as that one, the current young group can still be known as the Ferocious Foursome as it continues to progress. Can the Rams still make the playoffs? The loss Monday gave them a playoff probability of 13 percent. Just another sign of their bad luck. Los Angeles built hopes after a rough start that was mostly due to a flood of injuries on offense, including Nacua and Kupp, not to mention multiple starters on the offensive line. But center Jonah Jackson, left guard Steve Avila and right tackle Joe Noteboom all came off injured reserve to play this week, and yet Stafford was hurried all night by a Dolphins defensive front that had underperformed this season. Stafford was sacked four times, while Nacua and Kupp combined for 16 receptions, but none for TDs. It was just one loss, and yet it seems inevitable that some kind of change is ahead for the Rams. After all, Kupp was rumored to be a trade possibility, and then the deadline passed with him still in Los Angeles. The reality is that the front office has signaled they are willing to look at any and all options to build a brighter future. For all that McVay has done in eight seasons as a head coach, he has yet to develop his own quarterback. Stafford is signed through 2026, with no indications the Rams are anywhere near moving away from their star. But he won’t play forever. In a season like this one—with games still remaining against the Philadelphia Eagles, Buffalo Bills, San Francisco 49ers and the first-place Arizona Cardinals—there is a hunger to know what happens next. “There was some execution that has to be better,” McVay said of his offense that he agreed was 'sloppy.’ “These are the things we have to clean up if we want to be the type of (effective) team from an offensive perspective.” The Rams are just 1.5 games behind the suddenly-hot Cardinals in the NFC West and a game behind the second-place 49ers. Hope remains. But as Monday showed, it’s best to be careful about what is on the menu. Copyright 2024"

Just two months ago, the NFL world was encouraging Tagovailoa to retire after watching him curl his fingers while down on the turf following a shot to the head during a 31-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills back on September 12.  It was the third confirmed concussion that Tagovailoa has had at the professional level, and it sidelined him for four games. Tagovailoa vowed not to wear a Guardian Cap upon his return. He stuck to his word, which was all well and good, assuming that he would make some playstyle changes to get himself out of harm’s way.  So much for that. After being picked off in the second quarter of a 23-15 win over the Rams on Monday night, Tagovailoa tried to bring down Los Angeles linebacker Christian Rozeboom, who had come down with the interception. Rozeboom was running along the sideline on his return when Tagovailoa lowered his shoulder and took a knee to the side of the head. The Miami signal-caller ended up being just fine, even sharing a few light moments with reporters following the game when asked about the tackle. “I went up to that dude that intercepted me and asked him, ‘Like bro, you couldn’t (of) just ran out of bounds or like cut back?’ … He told me after the game, he’s like, ‘There’s no room, there was nowhere else to go,’” Tagovailoa said. “He gotta do what he gotta do to help his team win games. “I wasn’t planning on using my head to go hit him, so.” Throughout his explanation of how things went down, Tagovailoa couldn’t stop smiling, even laughing at times—because what could possibly be funnier than another traumatic brain injury, right?  Dolphins coaches need to start getting some of the blame here, too. To continuously let Tagovailoa go out there and throw himself headfirst at opposing defenses is just plain irresponsible.  It needs to be made clear to Tagovailoa that he quite literally cannot suffer another concussion. Not only would that one likely be career-ending, but it could also be life-altering, both mentally and physically. Surely these conversations have been had—or at least we hope that’s the case—but it looks like the message still hasn’t gotten through. Something tells us we haven’t seen Tagovailoa get knocked out for the last time. The saddest part? No one is going to intervene. Miami isn’t going to bench the 26-year-old, and the NFL certainly isn’t going to step in. For a league that says it cares so much about the health of its players, here’s a chance to possibly save one, and all it’s going to do is look the other way. We obviously hope Tagovailoa cleans up his game in such a way that will prevent a major head injury from ever happening again. But when he—and everyone else around him—seemsly embraces recklessness, it feels like another disaster is bound to happen.

That’s arguably the greatest area of intrigue at the dawn of the NBA Cup, an in-season tournament that will contest group play on Tuesdays and Fridays from today through Dec. 3 to decide an elimination bracket later that month. We look at the start of the event as well as a showdown between NHL Eastern Conference contenders and a juicy piece of college football MACtion. Let’s go. Embiid may have returned sooner from a left knee injury, but he racked up a three-game suspension for shoving a Philadelphia Inquirer columnist. The transgression? Name-dropping Embiid’s son and late brother in a column, calling into question his ability to stay in shape. Now the star center gets the chance to take out frustration on a Knicks team that eliminated Philly from the playoffs last season. Embiid likely will be on a minutes restriction, but his track record for efficiency and the struggling Sixers’ urgency could equal instant contribution. Limited to 39 games last season due to injury, Embiid shot 52.9 percent—including 38.8 percent from deep—while averaging a career-best 34.7 points.

The defending Stanley Cup champion Panthers have won seven straight and their 23 points are one clear of the Devils for tops in the Eastern Conference. New Jersey was blanked for the second time in five games during Sunday’s 1-0 home loss to San Jose, unable to solve former Devil Mackenzie Blackwood in a 44-save shutout. The Panthers needed a shootout to defeat the visiting Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday, the first time in their current tear that they didn’t prevail by at least two goals. Florida leading scorer Sam Reinhart had an assist to stretch his points streak to seven games and is eager to get another crack at New Jersey. He scored four goals in three games against the Devils last season.

The same Huskies who upset then-No. 5 Notre Dame in September had since lost three conference games. Their triumph over the Broncos tightened the sprint for a spot in the league championship game in Detroit on Dec. 7, which goes to the top two schools in the MAC. Western Michigan and Bowling Green are among four teams with one loss, with two others one game behind. Unfortunately for the Broncos, the NIU game wasn’t an anomaly for the defense. Western Michigan has permitted at least 24 points in four of its five conference contests. The Huskies gained 255 of their 411 yards on the ground while throwing just three incompletions. Now comes a Bowling Green attack that features the MAC’s top receiver in Harold Fannin Jr. (73 catches, 1,033 yards, six touchdowns) and averages 378.1 yards—slightly behind Western Michigan’s league-best 406.8. Connor Bazelak has passed for 2,022 yards, third most in the conference, and will oppose a counterpart in the Broncos’ Hayden Wolff, who’ll be primed for a rebound. Expect offense aplenty.

After suffering a 35-6 loss to then-No. 6 Penn State last Saturday in the Nittany Lions' annual white-out game in University Park, Pa., Washington will return home for its own black-out night when they take on UCLA (4-5 overall, 3-4 Big Ten) on Friday in Seattle. The usually purple-clad Huskies (5-5, 3-4) instead will don black uniforms, and fans are also encouraged to wear black. ""Some great uniforms coming out,"" Washington coach Jedd Fisch said. ""So excited about that."" The Huskies this season have played in a black-out at Rutgers (Sept. 27), a stripe-out at Iowa (Oct. 12) and a red-out at Indiana (Oct. 26) before last Saturday's white-out. They lost all of those games, although they are 5-0 at Husky Stadium. Washington likely needs to defeat UCLA to become bowl eligible as its last game of the regular season is Nov. 30 at No. 1 Oregon. The Huskies have had a short turnaround after not getting back to Seattle until 5 a.m. Sunday following their game at Penn State. ""Short week, a little bit of a cram session,"" Fisch said. ""But as I told the staff, ‘Sleep Saturday.'"" Quarterback Will Rogers is expected to start against UCLA after getting benched at halftime last weekend for Demond Williams Jr.  ""Will was a victim of circumstances, a little bit,"" Fisch said. ""He was 10-for-13 in the first half, just we weren't able to get anything going."" The Bruins have won three in a row, including a 20-17 decision against visiting Iowa last Friday. They have games remaining against rival Southern California and Fresno State as they try to qualify for a bowl game. The win over the Hawkeyes was UCLA's first in four tries at the Rose Bowl this season. ""I didn't want to make too big of a deal about us being back home, but we kind of treated this game like a road game,"" Bruins coach Deshaun Foster said. ""I just think my guys, they came out and they earned the right to win. Just in how they practiced (last) week and I think as long as we continue to do that, this team can really just take off."" UCLA quarterback Ethan Garbers started his collegiate career at Washington in 2020 -- he was named the Huskies' offensive scout squad MVP -- before transferring to Westwood the next year.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Louisiana won its most recent game, however the Ragin' Cajuns coach wasn't totally satisfied. Both teams are focused on early-season improvement ahead of their game Wednesday night in Houston. Houston (1-1) dropped to No. 8 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll after a 74-69 home loss to then-No. 11 Auburn last Saturday. The Cougars opened the season with a 97-40 victory against outmanned Jackson State, prompting coach Kelvin Sampson to say that he wanted his team to be challenged in its second game. ""This team needed to be tested,"" Sampson said. ""That's why we scheduled the game. You have wins and losses, but you also have wisdom and learning. This was a learning night for us."" Sampson said his team had its lofty ranking because of its ""rebounding and transition defense."" But those areas weren't advantages against the lengthy and athletic Tigers. Auburn outscored Houston 14-10 in fast-break points, including a 12-3 edge while it outscored the Cougars 46-36 in the second half. The teams each had 33 rebounds. ""We got exposed in some areas that we've got to go back and figure out how we can get better and clean up some things,"" Sampson said. ""This is a great learning tool for us. We weren't very good offensively in a lot of ways, but their defense had a lot to do with that. ""We hope we can learn from a loss to a really good team. There is no shame on our side."" J'Wan Roberts was one of five Houston players to score in double figures. He finished with 12 points along with seven rebounds. ""I don't think this game defines our season,"" Roberts said. ""When we look at the film there's a lot of stuff we've got to work on to try and get better for the next game."" The next game is against Louisiana (1-1), which defeated visiting UT Dallas 82-65 last Thursday. ""We showed some inconsistency,"" Ragin' Cajuns coach Bob Marlin said. ""It's a learning process. We had our moments each half offensively and defensively. And then the second half I thought we did a pretty good job pressuring the ball and defensively we got off to a better start."" Marlin said his team had too many unforced errors among its 14 turnovers and he was ""really disappointed"" in its 3-point shooting (4 of 21). ""We've got to do a better job of shooting the ball,"" Marlin said, but he added that his team's shortcomings were overcome by preventing its opponent from taking full advantage. UT Dallas, which made 7 of 28 3-pointers, turned the ball over 24 times and Louisiana had a 30-9 advantage in points off turnovers. ""(The Ragin' Cajuns) are disappointed because they know they're better than they played,"" Marlin said, ""but we're still growing as a team."" The game against Houston will be a far greater challenge for Louisiana, which opened the season with a 70-66 home loss to Kent State on Nov. 4. ""We'll learn more when we go to Houston,"" Marlin said. ""It'll be a super tough game. They're one of the most physical teams in the country, if not the most physical."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

UConn coach Danny Hurley said he will be looking for a better effort than the one his team put forth in Saturday night's 92-53 victory over New Hampshire. The Huskies (2-0) held just an 11-point halftime lead in that game.   ""I said to those guys in the locker room, ‘You won by 39 points, but the reality of the situation is that game was below brand for us for a considerable amount of time,'"" Hurley said. ""The standard is high here. That was clearly a below-standard performance for us in a number of ways, in particular on-ball defense. ... I thought there were some good things, but for the most part it was a frustrating game.   ""We've got some young guys who are gonna get better defensively who right now are not good defensive players. These games early in the year are important to learn lessons and develop and get better.""   Senior forward Alex Karaban has led the Huskies in scoring in each of their first two games. He had 20 points in a 92-56 season-opening victory against Sacred Heart and 17 versus New Hampshire. He's averaging 5.5 assists and 5.5 blocks per game.   ""Alex is playing the way a Big East Player of the Year is supposed to be playing from a statistical standpoint, an efficiency standpoint, but he's also been super vocal and doing everything we want him to do right now,"" Hurley said.    Le Moyne (1-2) is in its second season as a Division I program. The Dolphins moved from Division II to the Northeast Conference before last season. Le Moyne opened its season with an 86-82 loss to Syracuse and a 97-75 setback to Cal State Northridge before rebounding to record a 107-73 victory over Division III SUNY Poly on Saturday.   Injuries have prevented Le Moyne from having its complete team available for a game this season. Guard AJ Dancler missed the Dolphins' first two games, and guard Robby Carmody -- who began his career at Notre Dame -- played in the loss to Syracuse but has missed the past two games with a leg injury. In addition, fifth-year guard Darrick Jones Jr. missed the Syracuse game, but came off the bench against Northridge.   ""At the end of the day we have to do a better job defensively and we know that,"" Le Moyne coach Nate Champion said following Saturday's win. ""We have to continue to get better as a team defensively and buy-in to that mindset.   ""(UConn is) a really good team. Hopefully we'll be ready to go. Hopefully we can perform at a high level again.""   Dwayne Koroma, a 6-foot-8 forward who started his career at Iona after being recruited by Rick Pitino, led the Dolphins with 17 points and six rebounds against SUNY Poly.    ""I think we're building the right culture here,"" Koroma said. ""I think we have a super-selfless group of guys. Everybody plays for each other.   ""A lot of (people) didn't expect us to have the performance we had against Syracuse, either. It doesn't matter if we're banged up or not, we're going to play as hard as we can and try to come out with a win.""   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After Vancouver's most recent outing, which continued the club's home-ice struggles, the Canucks could use it. Lekkerimaki, who was selected 15th overall in that draft, will be counted on to provide some of the scoring punch lost with Brock Boeser on the shelf due to a suspected concussion.  Lekkerimaki, 20, collected five goals and two assists in seven games for Abbotsford of the American Hockey League before being summoned. He practiced on a line with J.T. Miller and Pius Suter on Monday. ""I'm not nervous right now, but probably get (nervous) the same day or a few hours before the game,"" Lekkerimaki said. ""I will just try to play my game. But at the same time, the first NHL game is special, so try to enjoy it, too. Just have fun and enjoy every second, on and off the ice."" The Canucks, who have only one win in six home games (1-2-3), saw their three-game winning streak snapped by a 7-3 thrashing from the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday. Struggling forward Elias Pettersson registered his first multi-point performance of the season with one goal and one assist. The Canucks likely will turn to goaltender Arturs Silovs, who had some mop-up duty after Kevin Lankinen surrendered all seven goals. ""We wanted to get him in a game and we'll go from there,"" coach Rick Tocchet said.  The Flames arrive after skating to a 3-1 win over the Los Angeles Kings at home on Monday night. ""There was a lot of good from a lot of players. There's not a lot I can be overly critical of. It was a pretty solid 60 minutes,"" coach Ryan Huska said. Goaltender Dustin Wolf turned in a sparkling 28-save performance. His shutout bid was quashed in the final minutes, but the victory was a solid effort through the lineup. ""I think everyone, as a whole, just shut them down,"" Wolf said. ""Any chances they had, I was able to see, for the most part. I'm just trying to help keep pucks out of our net and if we score one more than they do, then we're going to be in pretty good hands."" The Flames finished a three-game Eastern road swing before returning home to face the Kings. While it will be a mean feat to rack up another victory on the West Coast, Calgary did show the blueprint in beating the Kings. The Flames controlled play from the start, were rewarded offensively and continued to hold momentum with a patient game that included a smart forecheck. ""We needed to start on time and be all over them, and that's what we did. Doing that all over them wears them down,"" forward Jonathan Huberdeau said. ""Scoring two quick goals and taking advantage (of the first period edge in play), we deserved it the way we were working. We needed to capitalize, and that's what we did, and after that, we didn't look back."" Calgary won the first meeting of the season between the Pacific Division rivals, a 6-5 overtime clash to open the season, in a game in which the Flames trailed 3-0 midway through the first period.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The half-dozen goals that got past Joel Blomqvist and Alex Nedeljkovic on just 12 shots were also the most Pittsburgh ever allowed in the first period at home. Five Stars players recorded two or more points in the barrage, with Marchment (one goal, three assists) tying a team record with four points in one period.

""We were relentless defensively I felt the whole game. Holding a team to two assists is just good. Period. ""I'd say that's part of our identity. When we get tired, we gotta defend, we gotta create an identity. We're gonna be stingy."" Gealer leads Stanford with an average of 16 points a game. Senior forward Maxime Raynaud, who entered the transfer portal after last season but decided to return, is averaging 15 points and 13 rebounds. McLaughlin is putting up 28.5 points and 3.5 steals per game for Northern Arizona. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Cleveland continued the best start in franchise history with its 12th victory in as many games. The Cavaliers trailed by nine points in the third quarter but recovered to keep coach Kenny Atkinson unblemished in his first season on the Cavaliers' bench. Mitchell drilled seven 3-pointers and had eight rebounds. The Bulls shot 49.4 percent but committed 21 turnovers leading to 35 Cavaliers points. Zach LaVine tied the game at 106-106 before the Cavaliers scored 13 of the game's last 20 points. LaVine led six Bulls players in double figures with 26 points. Spurs 116, Kings 96 Victor Wembanyama amassed 34 points and 14 rebounds to lead San Antonio past visiting Sacramento, which was playing the second game of a road back-to-back and was outscored 56-41 in the second half. Wembanyama was 13 of 22 from the field, including 6 of 12 from 3-point range, and made both of his free throws. Wembanyama added six assists, three blocks and one steal. Julian Champagnie added 13 points for the Spurs. De'Aaron Fox led the Kings with 24 points while Domantas Sabonis racked up 23 points and 11 boards and DeMar DeRozan scored 21 points.

Thunder 134, Clippers 128 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored a career-high 45 points to lead host Oklahoma City, playing its first game without Chet Holmgren (pelvic fracture), to a win over Los Angeles. Jalen Williams logged 28 points and eight rebounds for the Thunder, who improved to 3-0 this season on the second night of a back-to-back. The Clippers had their four-game winning streak end despite getting 31 points from Norman Powell plus 22 points and 14 rebounds from Ivica Zubac. Rockets 107, Wizards 92 Alperen Sengun produced his eighth double-double and helped Houston fend off a fourth-quarter charge from visiting Washington. Sengun paired 27 points with 17 rebounds to pace the Rockets, who overcame the absence of point guard Fred VanVleet (hamstring). Houston recorded only 13 assists, relying on transition opportunities (23 fast-break points) and a dominant performance from Sengun in the paint to survive. Kyle Kuzma scored eight points during an 11-4 Wizards run that opened the fourth and cut the deficit to 86-80. Following a Houston timeout, Sengun converted a dunk and a driving layup before nailing a 3-pointer to help the Rockets reclaim control and a double-digit lead at 93-80. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Ducks (2-0) beat UC Riverside and Montana by an average of 23 points, including a 79-48 smackdown of Montana on Friday. Oregon coach Dana Altman, in his 15th season at the school, wasn't about to get excited over two early-season wins. ""A lot of things to learn about being a good basketball team and making teams work,"" Altman said after the win over the Grizzlies. ""But it's Nov. 8 and we've got a lot of new guys. Just got a lot of work to do."" Oregon's scoring has been balanced with five players averaging in double digits. Nate Bittle leads the squad in scoring (16.5 ppg) and rebounding (10.5 per game). Kwame Evans Jr. is averaging 14.5 points and 6.5 rebounds, and he is followed by TJ Bamba (13 points per game), Brandon Angel (12) and Jadrian Tracey (10). Bamba is in his first campaign with the Ducks after playing three seasons for Washington State and last season at Villanova. He is focused on developing chemistry within the squad. ""I feel like with all my teammates I somewhat have connections,"" Bamba said, ""but it's still got to improve."" Oregon held Montana to 34 percent shooting from the field and forced the Grizzlies into 14 turnovers. Bittle was the key performer with 17 points and nine rebounds. The Ducks are 51-10 all-time against the Pilots, including a 78-56 victory on Dec. 17, 2022, in the latest matchup. Portland (1-1) opened the season by beating NAIA program Lewis & Clark before being routed 94-53 by visiting UC Santa Barbara on Saturday.

Chris Austin had just five points on 2-of-10 shooting on Saturday during a contest in which Portland shot 30.3 percent from the field and a measly 5 of 31 (16.1 percent) from 3-point range. ""What we try to do is get up on the floor and play fast,"" Portland coach Shantay Legans told reporters prior to the season. ""... The best players should get the most shots on the team.""

Iowa will go for three in a row Tuesday night when South Dakota visits Iowa City. Iowa is coming off an 89-74 home decision Thursday night over Southern in which the Hawkeyes drilled 18 3-pointers, their highest total in a game since the 2022 Big Ten tournament and matching for the fifth most during McCaffery's 15 years. Pryce Sandfort came off the bench to hit 6 of 8 from long distance and score a game-high 22 points. Older brother Payton Sandfort added 17 points, stuffing the stat sheet with eight rebounds and seven assists (though he committed six turnovers). He leads five Hawkeyes in double figures so far at 18.5 points per game. The trip to Iowa will represent a big step up in class for the Coyotes (3-0), who are coming off a 77-47 rout Sunday of NAIA opponent Mount Marty (S.D.). Shey Eberwein came off the bench to score a game-high 15 points for South Dakota, which established a 40-22 halftime lead and never looked back. Four players are averaging in double figures for the Coyotes, who were picked to finish seventh in the nine-team Summit League. Northwestern State transfer Chase Forte is leading the way at 14.7 ppg and Isaac Bruns is chipping 12 ppg. Third-year coach Eric Peterson said Forte has been a good addition to his roster.

Utah drained 19 3-pointers in each of its first two games, a 100-59 blowout of Alcorn State and a 98-63 rout of Central Arkansas. ""I'm proud of how we've been able to adapt and adjust to get through these two games,"" Utes coach Craig Smith said.

Jackson State is playing its third straight road game to open the season and will be looking for its first win after falling to High Point 80-71 on Saturday. While Xavier has improved its offensive rebounding since the first 20 minutes of its season, it is trying to do the same with its 3-point defense. The Musketeers surrendered six offensive rebounds that turned into 10 second-chance points in the first half of their opener against Texas Southern, falling behind by as many as nine points. Since that point, Xavier has won the rebounding battle 45-38, allowing only 11 second-chance points. The problem for Xavier has been its defense against the 3-point shot. Texas Southern and IU Indy went a combined 24 of 51 from beyond the arc. IU Indy drained 14 of its 28 shots from long distance Friday as Xavier struggled to put the Jaguars away. ""We have to get better on our end defending the 3-point shot,"" Xavier coach Sean Miller said. ""We have to fix the leak in the roof and be better in that area. When you give up 14 of 28 from three, that's a concern.""

Five Bulldogs scored in double figures during a 101-66 rout of Georgia State on Friday. In that contest, three players made their first career starts for Mississippi State, which is growing in a new philosophy under third-year coach Chris Jans. ""I want our team to play and get great shots and put pressure on the defense and score early when we can,"" Jans said. ""But on the other end, if we don't turn them over, I want them to have to go all the way to the shot=clock (buzzer) and work for open looks. ""The difference in length of possessions offensively and defensively is way more important to me than when people talk about what our pace is."" The Bulldogs drilled 10 3-pointers against Georgia State while boasting a 54-24 scoring edge in the paint. Josh Hubbard scored a team-high 15 points and Riley Kugel followed with 14. Hubbard, who shot 3-for-6 from long range, has made at least one 3-pointer in 15 straight games. Tuesday marks the second game of a 10-game road trip for Southeastern Louisiana. A 14-0 run in the first half at UAB on Sunday helped the Lions take a 10-point lead, but they couldn't hold the momentum. The Blazers responded with a 12-1 run to close the half en route to a 82-72 victory. Jakevion Buckley sparked Southeastern Louisiana (1-1) with 16 points and freshman Jeremy Elyzee posted his first career double-double, contributing 14 points and 10 rebounds.

The Horned Frogs and Bobcats had a triple-overtime thriller in their last meeting on Nov. 24, 2009, with TCU prevailing 108-99. TCU (2-0) has improved its program significantly since then, as it has made it to the NCAA Tournament in each of the previous three seasons under Jamie Dixon. TCU is hoping to make a fourth straight with wins over Florida A&M and Florida Gulf Coast already under its belt.  The Horned Frogs have become consistent winners early in seasons, too, posting a 53-6 record in the month of November since the 2014-15 campaign. TCU's offense shined in its season-opening victory over Florida A&M (105-59), while the defense received much of the credit in its 67-51 victory over Florida Gulf Coast. ""We found a way to get it done defensively, rebounding-wise, got all of our defensive goals, our standards, so that's a good sign,"" Dixon said after the victory over Florida Gulf Coast. ""Offensively, just not very good early and it wasn't like missing shots. It's just (that) our decision-making wasn't great."" Sophomore guard Vasean Allette has come off the bench to lead the Horned Frogs in scoring in each of the first two games, averaging 17.0 points per contest. For Texas State (2-0), this will be its first road game of the season. The Bobcats went 5-11 on the road last year. Sophomore guard Kaden Gumbs has led the team in scoring the first two games, scoring 15 points against Eastern Michigan and 27 points against McMurry. Guard Drue Drinnon is another player to watch and is an outside threat, knocking down five 3-pointers in the last game against McMurry. As a team, Texas State improved its field-goal percentage from 41.7 against Eastern Michigan to 56.7 vs. McMurry. Asked about the improvement on offense, Bobcats coach Terrence Johnson said, ""It's a good pass, which is usually going to be a good shot.

Johnson led the way for Texas with 28 points and now has racked up a combined 57 points in his first two collegiate games. Texas (1-1) never trailed against Houston Christian. The Longhorns were up by seven at halftime but roared out of the break, scoring the first 12 points of the second half as part of a 24-2 run to begin the second half. Johnson hit two 3-pointers and had 10 points in that pivotal spurt while Texas' defense held the visitors to 2-of-12 shooting over the first nine minutes of the half and won its 23rd consecutive home-opening game. ""We were able to get out and play to our strengths, which is to get out, play fast in transition, put pressure on the basket and let our guys get a chance to play a little bit in open space,"" Texas coach Rodney Terry said afterward. Arthur Kaluma added 15 points, Chendall Weaver had 12, Jordan Pope scored 11, and Kadin Shedrick and Jayson Kent hit for 10 points each for the Longhorns  in Friday's victory. Texas is still without guard Tramon Mark, who has missed the first two games with an ankle injury and has no specific timeline for a return. Johnson continues to wow, as expected for the presumptive one-and-done guard. He said the team's intense summer workouts have helped him adapt quickly to the college game. ""I feel like my adjustments have mainly been in practice, working against other good players, older players,"" Johnson said. ""It's just been playing off my teammates, letting it come to me, and shooting the open shot."" Johnson is 21 of 38 from the floor and 10 of 18 from 3-point range over his first two games. By comparison, former Texas one-and-done player Kevin Durant scored 20 and 21 points, respectively, in his first two collegiate contests. ""Tre is one of those guys that I think every game, every day, he's just getting better and better,"" Terry explained. ""It's really about developing a pro mentality.""

In the Tigers' 88-62 win on Friday over Saint Francis (Pa.), Ian Schieffelin had 16 points and 13 rebounds while Jaeden Zackery delivered 16 points, six assists and four steals. Zackery, who averaged double-figure scoring for each of the past three years at Boston College, has excelled at both ends of the floor. On Friday, when Clemson coach Brad Brownell said he thought his team ""had some guys that just didn't play quite as hard,"" he also singled out Zackery for his effort. ""Jaeden Zackery was terrific all night,"" Brownell said. ""I thought his on-ball defense was really good."" Zackery's presence at the point has allowed backcourt mate Chase Hunter to focus on scoring. Hunter leads the Tigers with an average of 15 points per game, hitting 57.9 percent from the floor and 5 of 9 from beyond the arc (55.6 percent). Eastern Kentucky counters with its top scorer, George Kimble III, a transfer from Division II Eckerd College, who is averaging 18 points and 4.5 assists per game.

UCLA (2-1) returned home after a disappointing loss to New Mexico in Henderson, Nev., on Friday, after which Bruins coach Mick Cronin called out his team for its turnover troubles. UCLA committed 15 giveaways on Monday but offset them with its stifling defense.  The Bruins converted Boston University's turnovers into 36 points. UCLA also dominated the interior, outscoring the Terriers 34-10 in the paint.  Stefanovic went 3-for-5 from 3-point range on a night UCLA collectively struggled from beyond the arc, going just 5-for-22 as a team. Sebastian Mack chipped in 12 points for the Bruins. Mack was a player Cronin specifically mentioned as someone who struggled offensively against New Mexico. Mack responded by committing no turnovers against the Terriers.  Boston University (0-3) was 6-for-24 from long distance, led by its only double-figure scorer, Kyrone Alexander. Alexander made 2 of 6 triples en route to 10 points. The Terriers were not much more successful inside the 3-point arc, going 8-for-22 on 2-point field-goal attempts. With its inability to get good looks from inside, Boston University also failed to get to the free-throw line often.  The Terriers attempted nine foul shots, making six. UCLA, meanwhile, went 18-for-21 at the free-throw line.  It was a blowout from the start, with the Bruins racing out to a 21-7 lead on Mack's 3-pointer with 11:24 left in the first half.  The visitors were later within nine, 28-19, following a pair of free throws from Nico Nobili with 2:56 to go, but UCLA then rattled off nine unanswered points to blow the game open. The Bruins went into the break up 39-22.  UCLA opened the second half on an 11-0 run, then led by at least 20 the rest of the way.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Knights (2-0) began the season with consecutive home wins, upsetting then-No. 13 Texas A&M 64-61 on Nov. 4 before rallying to beat an experienced Purdue Fort Wayne team 75-68 on Friday to give coach Johnny Dawkins his 150th career win at UCF. Florida Atlantic (2-0) has started quickly under first-year coach John Jakus, nearly hitting the century mark in each of its first two games. After a season-opening 97-64 win over Indiana State on Nov. 4, the Owls blasted NAIA foe Coastal Georgia 99-49 on Friday. With Florida Atlantic coming to town, Dawkins is trying to focus on building team chemistry since 11 newcomers are on the UCF roster this season. Among the fresh faces is former UTSA guard Jordan Ivy-Curry, who went for 18 points against Purdue Fort Wayne. George Mason transfer Keyshawn Hall had 14 points and 12 boards in the victory, while true freshman Moustapha Thiam chipped in 13 points and six rebounds. ""I'm still learning about these guys. This is our second game -- including exhibition games, this is our fourth game,"" Dawkins said following the meeting with Purdue Fort Wayne. ""When you have that many new players, I'm still learning about what they're like in games."" Jakus can relate, as the Owls lost 10 players from last season's 25-win team. Jackson State transfer Ken Evans Jr. and Louisville transfer Kaleb Glenn scored 18 points apiece against Coastal Georgia. Florida Atlantic has outrebounded opponents 98-62 through its first two games, but the Owls realize that the Knights pose quite the challenge on the glass. ""UCF is a very big team. They got some big guards, so one through five has to hit (the boards),"" Florida Atlantic forward Tre Carroll said. The Knights lead the all-time series between the teams 22-10. However, Florida Atlantic has taken five of its past seven games against UCF. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Yellow Jackets (1-1) allowed North Florida to shoot a sizzling 53.6 percent from the floor en route to a 105-93 setback to the Ospreys on Sunday. The contest marked the first time Georgia Tech surrendered 100 points in a game since a four-overtime loss to Georgia State, 123-120, in the 2020-21 season opener. ""It's a weird game from the standpoint of we scored the ball, but we just couldn't stop them at all,"" Yellow Jackets head coach Damon Stoudamire said. ""We gotta go back to the drawing board. I'm not disappointed by any means. It's still early. We just got some things we need to address. I'm bent out of shape by losing, I'm mad about losing, but we'll get past this and we gotta get ready for the next game."" Georgia Tech's Luke O'Brien downplayed his 15-point, eight-rebound performance and instead told reporters that he felt his team's defense was ""pretty pathetic."" Baye Ndongo recorded his seventh career double-double for the Yellow Jackets, posting team highs in points (20) and rebounds (10) on Sunday. Javian McCollum followed up his 18-point effort in Georgia Tech's 85-62 victory over West Georgia on Wednesday with 14 more vs. North Florida. Texas Southern (1-2) also was rather generous in its last game, a 92-64 setback to Georgia on Sunday in a Peach State Classic contest in Athens, Ga. Kenny Hunter scored 16 points on 8-of-12 shooting from the floor for Texas Southern, and Kavion McClain added 13 while making 6 of 8 shots. However, the rest of the Tigers combined to go 10-for-45 (22.2 percent) from the field. What's worse, the entire team made just 1 of 19 attempts from 3-point range and was outrebounded by a 53-23 margin. Despite the Tigers' struggles with their shooting, Georgia Bulldogs coach Mike White was quick to credit their aggressiveness on defense. ""Texas Southern's really physical, very, very handsy, tipped a lot of balls,"" White said. ""They were just super active.

The Seminoles (2-0) have that opportunity when they host Tarleton State (0-2) in Tallahassee, Fla. The Texans have lost their two games by 34 and 29 points, and they face their second Atlantic Coast Conference opponent, after losing at SMU 96-62 to open the season. Tarleton State then fell to visiting Sam Houston State 91-62. Florida State is coming off a 73-65 win over Rice in Houston on Saturday. Jamir Watkins scored 17 of his 30 points in the second half for the Seminoles, who never trailed but had to play solid defense down the stretch to hold off the Owls. Florida State's depth and defense, which have been staples of coach Leonard Hamilton's most successful teams, were on display as nine players got on the scoresheet and 12 received playing time. The Seminoles' defense totaled nine steals and seven blocks while scoring 23 points off Rice's 17 turnovers. ""You know, up north, you don't really play defense like how we play down here, especially at Florida State,"" said Florida State big man Taylor Bol Bowen, a native of Vermont. ""It's more packed line and a little bit softer, and I definitely always got blocks and stuff, but just being more active on the ball and using my length was something that they taught me and developed here."" Tarleton State coach Billy Gillispie shook things up with a couple of lineup changes against Sam Houston State, as Izzy Miles and Joseph Martinez each started. However, the result wasn't much different. Bubu Benjamin led the Texans again, finishing with 17 points and a career-high 10 rebounds for his first collegiate double-double.

Nashville defenseman Brady Skeji had the puck just inside the blueline in the Colorado zone but lost an edge. Girard took the puck, skated in on Juuse Saros ahead of Skeji and scored over Saros' blocker to win it. It was his first goal of the season, and he also added an assist on the night. Mikko Rantanen and Devon Toews also scored and Alexandar Georgiev turned away 29 shots for the Avalanche, who have won two in a row. Luke Evangelista and Colton Sissons scored for the Predators and Saros finished with 29 saves. Georgiev allowed an early goal for the second straight game but then kept Nashville off the board for the next two periods. The Predators got that goal 1:45 during a delayed penalty. Juuso Parssinen took a shot from the point that Georgiev stopped but Evangelista scooped the rebound and tapped it in for his second goal of the season. It stayed that way until the second period. Four seconds after Nashville killed off Zachary L'Heureux's minor, Toews took a shot from the point that deflected off a Predators stick and by Saros at 4:32. It was the first goal of the season for Toews. The Avalanche took the lead midway through the second when Joel Kiviranta had the puck at the top of the slot, passed it to Rantanen in the right circle, and his one-timer beat Saros to the short side at 11:37. It was his ninth of the season and the second straight game with a goal. Nashville tied it up in the first minute of the final period. Roman Josi stole the puck at the Colorado blueline, skated into the zone and fed Sissons with a pass to the side of the crease. Sissons slid it into a wide-open net at 59 seconds.

The 54-year-old Boston native was joined in the Class of 2024 by ex-NHL players Pavel Datsyuk and Shea Weber, women's stars Natalie Darwitz and Krissy Wendell-Pohl, and executives Colin Campbell and David Poile. Roenick composed himself at the start of his speech before saying, ""I love this game. It's been such a huge part of my life for most of my life and this is the best way I can finally find to end this chapter of my life."" Roenick compiled a total of 513 goals with 703 assists with the Chicago Blackhawks (1988-89 to 1995-96), the Phoenix Coyotes (1996-97 to 2000-01 and 2006-07), the Philadelphia Flyers (2001-02 to 2003-04), the Los Angeles Kings (2005-06) and the San Jose Sharks (2007-08 and 2008-09). Only Brett Hull, Mike Modano and Keith Tkachuk scored more goals in the NHL than Roenick among U.S.-born players. Datsyuk, a 46-year-old Russian, spent all 14 seasons of his NHL seasons with the Detroit Red Wings. He logged 918 points (314 goals, 604 assists) and was part of Stanley Cup-winning sides in 2002 and 2008. Datsyuk also captured an Olympic gold medal in 2018 and was a four-time recipient of the Lady Byng Trophy, given for gentlemanly conduct. ""As I stand here today, I realize that being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame is tremendous honor, the honor I couldn't even dream of, but this moment is not mine alone. It is shared with all of you,"" Datsyuk said Monday. Weber, a 39-year-old British Columbia native, played with the Nashville Predators from 2005-06 to 2015-16 and then with the Montreal Canadiens from 2016-17 to 2020-21. The defenseman posted 589 points (224 goals, 365 assists) in the NHL and won gold with Canada in 2010 and 2014. ""I want to thank all those players who demonstrated the importance of hard work and dedication,"" Weber said Monday. ""By passing on your knowledge to the next generation, you're ensuring that the spirit of this game continues to thrive. ""It's also when the coaches and staff teach you the nuances of the game. They challenge you to get better every day."" Darwitz notched the winning goal for Minnesota in the 2005 NCAA championship game against Harvard. She played for the United States at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 Olympics. ""I wasn't your everyday little girl, and somehow my mom was on to me,"" Darwitz said Monday. ""Despite some obvious distraction techniques on her part, in the name of tap dancing classes and shopping trips, she knew where my heart was, and on my fifth birthday, my blonde French braid strolled into the hockey rink."" Wendell-Pohl, another Golden Gophers great, captured the Patty Kazmaier Award for the top female college hockey player in 2005. She was selected the MVP of the 2005 IIHF World Championships, when the U.S. team won its first gold medal, and she was the captain of the 2006 Olympic team. ""I feel so fortunate that hockey has allowed me to represent not only my hometown, my state but my country,"" Wendell-Pohl said. ""Playing in the Olympics was never why I started playing hockey but I am beyond grateful to have been blessed and had the opportunity to wear the red, white and blue."" Campbell has been a player, coach and executive across a 52-year hockey career, and he has been the senior executive vice president for the NHL's hockey operations, officiating and central scouting departments for 25 years. Campbell won a Stanley Cup as associate coach of the New York Rangers in 1994. Poile retired as general manager of the Nashville Predators in 2023 after becoming the winningest and longest-tenured general manager in league history. He was GM of the Washington Capitals from 1982-97, then served in the same role in Nashville for 27 years. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

That's what Seattle Kraken coach Dan Bylsma did with forwards Oliver Bjorkstrand and Tye Kartye on Nov. 5 at Colorado. The move seems to have paid off, as Bjorkstrand scored a goal and Kartye assisted on another as the Kraken snapped a four-game skid with a 4-3 overtime victory against the visiting Vegas Golden Knights on Friday. After a weekend off, the Kraken will host the struggling Columbus Blue Jackets on Tuesday. Bjorkstrand's gritty goal early in the third period -- Golden Knights goalie Adin Hill lunged to make a pokecheck, only for the puck to careen off Bjorkstrand as he charged to the top of the crease and deflect into the net -- put the Kraken ahead 3-2 after they had fallen behind 2-0. ""I thought his game, in particular, was a great bounce-back game for him,"" Bylsma said. ""He's a talented, skilled player with a great shot and scores a lot of goals. His competition was at a great level for him to have success in the game. And it's not just the evidence of going to the net and scoring a dirty goal, but on the wall in the first period, at the faceoff (circle), also in the first period, the battle on the wall in the second period in front of our bench. It was great."" Bjorkstrand, who told reporters he needed to be better when asked about being a healthy scratch, was pleased to impact the game. ""Yeah, it was good,"" he said. ""I would have been ready in Colorado, but I was ready (Friday), kept it simple. I feel like I played well with the puck and was able to create some chances."" After a promising start to the season, the Blue Jackets are winless in their past five games (0-4-1). They fell 4-2 on Sunday at Anaheim as Ducks goaltender John Gibson, making his season debut after undergoing an emergency appendectomy on Sept. 25, stopped 38 shots. Kirill Marchenko had a goal and an assist for Columbus. Yegor Chinakhov also scored, and Daniil Tarasov made 26 saves. ""It's unacceptable,"" said Columbus defenseman Zach Werenski, who was playing in his 500th NHL game. ""Enough with the moral victories. We've played well enough in a lot of games this year to win and we end up losing them, and that's on us. ""We have to look ourselves in the mirror and find a way to win hockey games. I don't care if we outshoot them 50-20 or we get outshot 50-20. At the end of the day, we have to find a way to get points in this league and win hockey games, and we haven't done it."" The Blue Jackets have scored just nine goals during their losing streak. ""Goal-scoring is funny. It goes in streaks,"" Columbus coach Dean Evason said. ""A few weeks back, we couldn't miss and the pucks were finding their way in and we were getting some bounces and good stuff. And now it's gone the other way a little bit, but there's nothing we can do about it now except move forward and keep doing those things to get those opportunities."" Both teams could have lineup reinforcements Tuesday. The Kraken reacquired forward Daniel Sprong, who scored 21 goals for them in 2022-23, in a trade with the Vancouver Canucks. The Blue Jackets claimed defenseman Dante Fabbro, a former first-round pick, off waivers from the Nashville Predators. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After the game, Minnesota coach Chris Finch took the blame for some confusion during the game's final two possessions. Center Rudy Gobert appreciated Finch's apology but said it was a team loss.

That's just not who we are. It really isn't. No excuse for that."" Jerami Grant led the Blazers with 20 points, while Dalano Banton and Donovan Clingan had 13 points apiece off the bench. Portland opened a four-game homestand by shooting 4-of-42 (9.5 percent) from 3-point range and committing 23 turnovers.

After Karty missed a 57-yard field-goal attempt on the opening drive of the second half, the Dolphins responded with a six-play, 53-yard drive that ended with Hill's 1-yard TD reception from Tagovailoa for a 17-6 lead.

The 34-year-old Thompson, a first-round pick by the Warriors in 2011, elected to leave Golden State in a sign-and-trade over the summer, ending a 13-year run that included two missed seasons because of Achilles and knee injuries. The four-time champion and five-time All-Star is averaging 13.8 points in his first 10 games for the Mavericks after averaging 17.9 points for the Warriors last season. Thompson departed Golden State ranked second to Stephen Curry on the franchise all-time list for career 3-pointers (2,481), while also sitting fourth in games (793), sixth in points (15,531) and ninth in steals (676). The homecoming comes as part of the second edition of the NBA Cup, an in-season tournament that was drawn with the Mavericks and Warriors in the same five-team pool with the Memphis Grizzlies, New Orleans Pelicans and Denver Nuggets. Thompson attempted to downplay his return by citing excitement for the NBA Cup, in which he and the Warriors went 2-2 last season. ""It'll be good to see people you grinded with,"" he said over the weekend. ""But to me, it's just another regular-season game in November. Obviously, there are bigger implications with the NBA Cup, so what's on my mind is to win that because I haven't been a part of it yet. I know it's young, but it'd be fun to play for that title."" Thompson's departure from the Warriors came as part of a six-team trade in which the Warriors acquired, among others, Buddy Hield from the Philadelphia 76ers. Hield has more than made up for the loss of Thompson, ranking among the NBA leaders in 3-pointers (40) and 3-point field goal percentage (48.8). Thompson has made 29 treys at a 35.4 percent clip for the Mavericks. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said there are no hard feelings about Thompson leaving. ""Sometimes a fresh start can be healthy,"" he said. ""Everybody's life and career arc is different. I think Klay made the right decision going to Dallas. Just seeing him the last couple of years, I think he needed a fresh start."" The Warriors plan to greet Thompson with a ""Salute Captain Klay"" interactive experience that will include a pregame video tribute. The Warriors have announced that his No. 31 will be retired when his playing days are over. Curry applauds the idea of celebrating his ""Splash Brother"" sooner rather than later. ""We have a game to play, so the focus has to be there,"" he said. ""But he deserves the celebration and the welcome he's going to get. It's a chance to reflect on all the memories we created together."" Coming off a 4-1 trip that included wins over the Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder, the Warriors take an 8-2 record into a four-day sequence in which they also will host Memphis in an NBA Cup game on Friday. With Kyrie Irving scoring 43 points, the Mavericks opened a three-game trip with a 122-120 loss at Denver on Sunday. Luka Doncic had 24 points, nine rebounds and nine assists. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Dustin Wolf, who came within a whisker of his first career shutout, made 29 saves. He also collected his first NHL point with an assist. Kevin Rooney also scored and Backlund finished with two points. Trevor Moore scored with 2:31 left in regulation for the Kings, while goaltender Darcy Kuemper stopped 25 shots. Despite outshooting and collecting more chances the visitors from the drop of the puck -- the Kings needed more than 11 minutes to register their first shot on goal -- the Flames failed to score for nearly 30 minutes to open the game. Backlund opened the scoring at 10:42 of the second period after gaining the puck in the slot off a turnover and whipping a top-corner shot for his fourth goal of the season. Huberdeau doubled the lead right shortly after the ensuing puck drop. Andrei Kuzmenko sprung Huberdeau on a partial breakaway, and, while holding off a check, Huberdeau slipped a low shot into the cage for his sixth goal of the campaign. Wolf got his assist on that goal. Moore finally solved Wolf with late in the third, converting a golden chance that needed video review to prove crossed the line for his third goal of the season. Rooney iced the game with an empty-net goal, his first tally of the season, with 20 seconds on the clock. Wolf showed he was on his game early when he denied Kevin Fiala on a first-period breakaway. He stared down Anze Kopitar moments after his team staked the 2-0 lead, and kept the door shut early in the third period when Adrian Kempe was sprung on a golden opportunity. Earlier in the day, the Flames announced forward Anthony Mantha would miss the remainder of the season due to knee surgery. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Zverev, the event's second seed, and Rublev, the eighth seed, began round-robin play in the John Newcombe Group. In the other match on Monday, also in the Newcombe Group, sixth-seeded Casper Ruud of Norway upset third-seeded Carlos Alcaraz of Spain 6-1, 7-5. The eight players in the season-ending tournament are split into two groups for the initial phase. The top two players from each group will advance to the semifinals. Zverev, 27, captured the year-ending event in 2018 and 2021. He enjoyed a strong 2024 season, reaching three Grand Slam semifinals for the first time in his career. He lost to Alcaraz in the French Open final and advanced to the semifinals of the Australian Open. On Monday, Zverev finished with a 9-3 edge in aces and a 22-10 advantage in winners. He never faced a break point and won on all seven of his net approaches. ""I thought it was a very solid match from my end,"" Zverev said. ""Against anyone here, you have to play your best to have a chance, you have to be solid (and) mentally strong. I feel like I did that today, I felt like I used my chances quite well and I'm obviously happy with this win."" He isn't bothered by not being favorite this season and this week. ""I think the attention went to Carlos and Jannik (Sinner) all year long,"" Zverev said. ""They deserve it, they won two Grand Slams each. ""It's normal in sports, at some point everybody retires, new players come along. We have a great group of guys leading with Jannik and Carlos. I think they had a better year, even though I'm No. 2 in the world. The benchmark is those two guys."" Alcaraz stumbled against Ruud, particularly at the key moments. Ruud saved five of the six break points on his serve while taking advantage of all four of his break opportunities. ""It's only one match, but it's definitely one of the best wins of the season for me,"" Ruud said. ""In terms of who I'm playing, his level, his ranking and all this stuff. I feel very happy, of course. I think we will see Carlos play better tennis than he did today, but I took care of my chances."" The Ilie Nastase Group continues play Tuesday, with top-seeded Jannik Sinner of Italy opposing fifth-seeded Taylor Fritz of the United States while fourth-seeded Daniil Medvedev of Russia opposes seventh-seeded Alex de Minaur of Australia.

""He's close,"" Collins said of the player's status. Northwestern (1-1) was without Barnhizer for its first two games, including Saturday night's 71-66 road loss to Dayton. The Wildcats led by as many as 13 in the first half before the Flyers came back, outscoring Northwestern 47-34 in the second half. Junior Nick Martinelli recorded career highs with 32 points and 14 boards. He made 12 of 16 field-goal attempts, including all three from beyond the arc. Martinelli was selected the Big Ten Player of the Week on Monday after becoming the first player in the conference since at least 1996-97 to post 25-plus points and 10-plus rebounds in the first two games of a season. Barnhizer is out with a lower-body injury but took part in warm-ups ahead of the Flyers game. Barnhizer averaged 14.6 points and 7.5 rebounds last season. Northwestern is attempting to win its fourth straight game against UIC. Collins is 3-0 against the Flames, each win by double digits. The teams last met in December 2022, with the Wildcats pulling away 92-54. The Wildcats lead the series 6-4. Freshman guard Angelo Ciaravino is slowly getting used to playing at the collegiate level through two games. Even in a losing effort, Ciaravino said it is a building block for future success. ""It's very surreal stepping out there and seeing all those people, but at the end of the day, it's us vs. them, and it's about focusing on what's on the court and drowning everything else out,"" said Ciaravino, who scored 12 points in 21 minutes against Dayton. The Flames (2-0) have rolled through their nonconference schedule thus far. In their victories against St. Francis (Ill.) and Yale, they scored 91 points in each game, with five scorers reaching double figures against the Bulldogs on Friday night. Tyem Freeman led the way in the 91-79 home victory with 19 points off the bench, while Jordan Mason added 16 in a reserve role. Sasa Ciani posted a double-double with 13 points and 11 rebounds, Jayon Jackson scored 13 and Ahmad Henderson II contributed 11 points and a game-high seven assists. UIC's last win against a power-conference opponent came at Northwestern's expense, 50-44 in 2012. The game against the Flames is the first of four home games at Welsh-Ryan Arena before the Wildcats travel to Tempe, Ariz., to take on Butler in the Arizona Tip-off on Thanksgiving Day. The Flames host Saint Mary's (Minn.) on Saturday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Oklahoma City is 3-0 this season on the second night of a back-to-back. The loss snapped a four-game winning streak by the Clippers. The Clippers cut what was a 20-point deficit to three with just more than two minutes remaining before Gilgeous-Alexander answered with a step-back 3-pointer. Ivica Zubac's three-point play with 42 seconds left cut the deficit to 130-128 before Gilgeous-Alexander hit a pair of free throws and Luguentz Dort had a steal leading to a Jalen Williams dunk in the closing seconds to put the game away. Playing a day after Chet Holmgren suffered a pelvic fracture in a loss to Golden State, the Thunder leaned heavily on Gilgeous-Alexander and Williams. Gilgeous-Alexander was 13 of 21 from the field and hit a season-high four 3-pointers while Williams added 28 points on 11-of-16 shooting. The Thunder shot 51.6 percent from the floor and were 22 of 23 from the free-throw line. Holmgren will be evaluated in eight to 10 weeks, the Thunder announced before the game. Playing without Holmgren, and with several other frontcourt players injured as well, the Thunder went with a smaller lineup. Oklahoma City thrived for much of the game after starting Williams with Aaron Wiggins and Dort in the frontcourt. The Thunder led for much of the game, building their lead to 20 by midway through the third. But the Clippers finally had success on the interior over the last half of the quarter, reeling off a 25-10 run to cut the deficit to five heading into the fourth. Zubac had six points and a block during the run, while Norman Powell had 12 points. Powell had a pair of steals in the final two minutes of the quarter that led to points on the other end.

Houston recorded only 13 assists, relying on transition opportunities and a dominant performance from Sengun in the paint to survive. Kyle Kuzma scored eight points during an 11-4 Wizards run that opened the fourth and cut the deficit to 86-80.

Polite's fastbreak layup tied the score, and UNC Greensboro soon claimed a 21-19 lead when Jalen Breath scored in the paint off a well-placed pass from Miles Jones on the right wing. The lead changed hands three times in a span of 1:12. Edwards connected on a 3-pointer for a 26-24 lead with 6:23 remaining and the Mustangs led for the rest of the first half, taking a 41-35 lead into the intermission. UNC Greensboro cut the deficit to 44-41 on a Giles' 3-pointer with 16:33 to go in the second half, but that was as close as the Spartans got.

The double-digit lead held until the 5:06 mark, when Polite drove right on a layup and cut SMU's advantage to nine. The Mustangs' counter came on the next possession, as Miller caught an inbounds pass, dribbled downcourt and passed to Yigitoglu between a pair of defenders. Yigitoglu finished with a two-handed dunk and was fouled as he flew toward the rim. He extended the lead to 68-56 on the ensuing free throw. Yigitoglu and Miller combined for another highlight-reel-worthy play with 2:22 left as Miller lofted an alley-oop to Yigitoglu for an 80-61 lead. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Erik Johnson also scored for Philadelphia, while Samuel Ersson made 28 saves. Michkov, who was a healthy scratch in each of the Flyers' previous two games, finished with a goal and an assist before his key tally in the shootout. Jack Thompson, Mikael Granlund and Barclay Goodrow scored for the Sharks, who had won five of their previous seven games. Vitek Vanecek made 40 saves for the visitors. After both teams failed on their first shootout attempt, Michkov deposited an impressive backhand-to-forehand move. Following a save by Ersson, Konecny netted the decisive goal, dragging the puck on his forehand before flipping it under the crossbar. The Flyers scored twice in the first period, beginning with Johnson's first goal of the season at 1:40. With just over four minutes left in the period, Konecny made it 2-0 on a tic-tac-toe setup, as Emil Andrae found Michkov, who one-timed a feed to Konecny, whose blast from the right circle beat Vanecek for a power-play goal. At 5:09 of the second period, Michkov got behind the defense and beat Vanecek 5-hole to make it 3-0. However, San Jose began to chip away later in the period. With about 4 1/2 minutes left in the stanza, William Eklund's centering pass caromed off Thompson's skate and past Ersson to get the Sharks on the board. About three minutes later, Eklund set up Granlund at the right faceoff dot for a spicy wrister that got under the crossbar. The score remained 3-2 until Goodrow netted the equalizer with 2:24 left in regulation. Henry Thrun's shot from the left point ricocheted to the right of the net where Goodrow slammed it past Ersson. San Jose began overtime with two minutes of a 4-on-3 advantage after Michkov took a roughing penalty at the end of regulation. Ersson made several key saves during the ensuing penalty kill. Vanecek made some key stops on the other end late in overtime, including denials of Andrae and Michkov to send the game to a shootout. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Texas A&M continued its dominance, doubling up Lamar leading by 31 at 62-31 early in the second half, and going up by as many as 38 points before cruising to the finish with the starters on the bench over the final eight minutes.

Texas A&M responded in a huge way, hitting three 3-pointers during a 15-0 run over the ensuing five minutes to go up 18-7. A 3-pointer by Hayden Hefner with 10:18 to play in the half stoked the Aggies lead to 14 points.  Lamar culled its deficit to 33-25 when Marmolejos produced a three-point play with 6:25 left, but that seemed to reignite Texas A&M's fire. The Aggies quickly forged a 12-2 run, and after two more layups and a free throw by Coleman, carried a 50-29 advantage to the break.

Dallas, which entered Monday with just 39 goals in 13 games, feasted on the league's third-worst scoring defense. In winning for the second time in three games, the Stars did nearly all of their damage in the opening period and cruised from there. The first-period six-pack tied the then-Minnesota North Stars, who also scored six in the first 20 minutes in a 7-2 win over the Los Angeles Kings on March 16, 1971. The franchise record for goals in any period is eight, set by Minnesota in the second period of a 15-2 home win against Winnipeg on Nov. 11, 1981. The half-dozen goals that got past Joel Blomqvist and Alex Nedeljkovic on just 12 shots were also the most Pittsburgh ever allowed in the first period at home. Five Stars players recorded two or more points in the barrage, with Marchment (one goal, three assists) tying a team record with four points in one period. That occurred 10 times previously, with Tyler Seguin and Valeri Nichushkin both accomplishing the feat most recently against Philadelphia on Dec. 7, 2013. Marchment's goal came when Brendan Smith cleared the puck from the Stars' end as both teams changed lines. The puck bounced off the board behind the Penguins' net and toward the slot, where Marchment got ahead of Matt Grzelcyk and Kris Letang to beat Blomqvist, make it 3-0 and end the starting netminder's night with 9:44 remaining in the period. Marchment, who entered Monday with two goals and six assists in 12 games, helped on goals from Matt Duchene, Miro Heiskanen and Seguin. He added a fifth point, one off his career high, when he and Duchene assisted on Wyatt Johnston's third-period goal. Heiskanen added an unassisted goal as he tallied his first two of the season, and the fifth two-goal game in the defenseman's career. Logan Stankoven also scored. After allowing three goals on four shots in relief of Blomqvist, Nedeljkovic settled down to make 28 saves for the Penguins, who lost for the third time in four games. Tristan Jarry, recalled from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton on Saturday, was a healthy scratch. Dallas goalie Jake Oettinger rebounded from being pulled after giving up four goals in less than 30 minutes in a loss at Winnipeg on Saturday. He made 20 saves on Monday, only allowing a second-period goal by Anthony Beauvillier. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Western Michigan responded with a 15-2 burst capped by a jumper from the elbow by Strickland with 11:11 to pull to 57-54, but Butler dominated the final minutes. Western Michigan scored only four points in the final 7:02 as the Bulldogs closed out with the game's final ten points. Butler went 10-21 from 3-point range and had 21 assists to the Broncos' seven. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Duke transfer Jaden Schutt led the Hokies with a career-high 17 points. Tobi Lawal added 10 points and 10 rebounds. Winthrop was led by Kasen Harrison's 19 points, while Doucet added 17 points and six boards. Defense ruled most of the night as the Hokies shot 33.3 percent (19-for-57) from the field and the Eagles hit 34.5 percent (20-for-58). Virginia Tech won the rebounding battle 43-32 and had seven more second-chance points. Schutt hit two 3-pointers early in the second half to give the Hokies a 29-27 lead. He added another trey with 16:38 left, and the lead was 32-28. Both teams went long stretches without a basket, but Doucet's driving layup pulled the Eagles within 35-34 with 11:46 remaining. Lawal's layup and Ben Hammond's 3-pointer from the right wing gave the Hokies their largest lead to that point, 40-34. Winthrop stayed close and Harrison's layup pulled them within 40-39 with 8:51 to go. The Eagles tied it briefly before five quick Virginia Tech points made it 47-42 with 6:13 remaining.

Lathan Sommerville scored 14 points off the bench with four rebounds and three blocks, while Jordan Derkack scored nine points and made key defensive stops in one-on-one coverage late to give the Scarlet Knights a 2-0 start to their season. Saint Peter's (0-3) were on a scoreless drought of about five minutes when Adetokunbo Bakare scored seven consecutive points for the Peacocks. After a layup and 3-point shot on consecutive fast breaks, the guard who didn't play a minute of the first half cut the visitor's deficit to four points, 57-53, after the Scarlet Knights had led by nine points with 11:04 remaining. Saint Peter's took the lead with 5:41 remaining after two shots from deep from Marcus Randolph and a go-ahead layup by Tyreck Morris. Then the two sides tied at 63 and traded baskets. After Morris' layup put the Peacocks ahead 65-64 with 4:07 remaining in regulation, the Scarlet Knights went on an 11-0 run to close out the game. Randolph led the scoring for Saint Peter's with 22 points. Mouhamed Sow added nine points with six rebounds. The difference for Rutgers was aggressive play by Saint Peter's, which committed 23 fouls against the Scarlet Knights. From those extra trips to the line, Rutgers added 12 points in the second half and went 18-for-25 from the line on the night. Rutgers was without top freshman prospect Ace Bailey, who hasn't played yet this season after sustaining an undisclosed injury in practice last week. Saint Peter's shooting gave the visitors an early advantage, going 16-for-30 from the field in the first half. However, Peacocks made only one of their first 10 shots from the floor to start the second half, with Rutgers outscoring them 18-6 in the first 10 minutes of the half.

Florida (3-0), which had only broken even in rebounding margin after two games, managed a 45-24 rebounding edge on Monday.  Sophomore center Rueben Chinyelu paced the Gators with a career-high 14 points on 7-for-8 shooting. Walter Clayton Jr. chipped in12 points, including 3-for-7 shooting from 3-point range. Will Richard also added 12 points and five rebounds, and Sam Alexis had 12 points and six rebounds. Alex Condon tallied 10 points, eight boards and two blocks. Florida shot 45.3 percent from the field and 30.4 percent (7 for 23) from long range. The Gators seemed unphased by the recent sexual misconduct allegations surrounding coach Todd Golden. Golden coached the game, as the matter is under investigation from the university. Grambling (1-2) came in off a two-point loss to Ole Miss but couldn't stay as close this time. Kintavious Dozier led the Tigers with 19 points and added five rebounds. Antwan Burnett added 15 points and five boards. Grambling pulled within 46-34 on a dunk by Ernest Ross with 17:24 to play, but Florida answered with a 9-0 run. The Tigers got no closer than 17 points thereafter. Grambling started the night's scoring on a layup by Dozier. Florida took the lead immediately on a 3-pointer from Clayton and never trailed again.  The Tigers pulled within 16-10 with 13:10 left in the first half on a bucket by James Flippin, who finished with 12 points. But a 9-2 Florida run stretched the edge to 25-12 on a free throw by Condon. The lead fluctuated between nine and 16 points for the remainder of the half. Grambling shot 42.6 percent from the field and 2 of 12 on 3-pointers. The Gators will travel to Tallahassee to face Florida State on Friday.

Guillermo Diaz-Graham powered for 10 points and nine rebounds while Zack Austin provided 10 points and four blocks for Pitt, which took advantage of its superior size inside. Darryl Simmons II paced Gardner-Webb (1-2) with 12 points. Anthony Selden and Jamaine Mann added 10 points each for the Runnin' Bulldogs, while Isaiah Richards had six points and a game-high 14 rebounds. After Gardner-Webb made a program-record 70 percent of its field-goal attempts on Friday in a win over North Carolina Central, the Runnin' Bulldogs made just 39.7 percent of their shots from the floor on Monday. Before the game was five minutes old, Pitt opened a 14-2 lead, which Leggett started and finished with baskets in the paint. Diaz-Graham added a 3-pointer and Dunn followed with a three-point play to fuel the surge. Midway through the half, Pitt began a 13-0 spree that included 3-pointers by Austin and Leggett. When Leggett finished the run with a fastbreak layup, the Panthers were on top 34-13. Over the final 6:05 of the half, Pitt missed nine consecutive field-goal attempts against Gardner-Webb's active 2-3 zone. During the dry spell, the Runnin' Bulldogs got 3-pointers from Ademide Badmus and Selden to cut a 21-point deficit to 38-23 at the break. Gardner-Webb made some noise in the second half, slicing a 19-point gap to 11 as Brendan Mycalcio came off the bench and scored six quick points. The Runnin' Bulldogs made their run largely by hustling for offensive rebounds. A three-point play by Selden midway through the half made it 55-44, but Gardner-Webb got no closer the rest of the way.

Reese barely missed a double-double but led the Terrapins (3-0) to their third consecutive victory by 30 or more points to open the season. Reese was one of five Maryland players to score in double figures as the Terrapins led wire-to-wire and were able to play 14 players after taking a double-digit lead for good with 3:53 left in the first half. Tyler Shirley with 10 points was the lone double-figure scorer for the Rattlers (0-3), who continued to struggle early on against tough competition in coach Patrick Crarey II's first season. Shirley, however, fouled out with 9:36 left in the second half. Maryland scored the game's first 15 points in three minutes. The Terrapins took advantage of five turnovers during that span and that became a theme throughout the contest as they finished with 11 steals. Florida A&M ended up with 22 turnovers overall, which led to 31 Maryland points. Ja'Derryus Eatmon's layup with 16:41 left in the first half finally got the Rattlers on the scoreboard. It also sparked a 12-2 surge, which cut Maryland's early advantage to five. But the Terrapins continued to turn mistakes into fast-break points and broke the game open by halftime, leading 40-21.

Also scoring in double figures for Virginia (2-0) were Isaac McKneely with 14 points and Dai Dai Ames with 13. Coach Tony Bennett is retired, but the Cavaliers showed that they can still play strong defense under interim coach Ron Sanchez. Virginia had 11 blocks and seven steals and limited Coppin State to 28 percent shooting from the field, including a 21.1 percent mark (4 of 19) from 3-point distance. Derrius Ward scored 12 points and Jonathan Dunn had 11 to lead the Eagles (0-4), who have lost 17 consecutive games dating back to last season. The Cavaliers blew the game open midway through the second half. Cofie's 3-pointer with 9:09 remaining capped a 13-0 run and gave Virginia a 53-27 lead.

Ohio State was playing as a ranked team for the first time since landing in the top 25 the week of Jan. 2, 2023.  Cris Carroll had 10 points and Ty Harper and Gabe Dynes each scored nine points for the Penguins (1-1), who were 3-for-22 on 3-pointers (13.6 percent).  Bradshaw and Stewart had only two points apiece in a season-opening victory against then-No. 19 Texas last Monday, but they combined for 15 in the first half against the Penguins.  Mobley, who went 4-for-4 from beyond the arc vs. the Longhorns, knocked down his first three triples of the night against Youngstown State to run his streak of made treys to seven before recording his first miss from deep.  It was a wonder why the Penguins only trailed 37-22 at intermission after their epic cold spells. They took a 2-0 lead 16 seconds into the game but went the next 6:14 without scoring while the Buckeyes reeled off 12 straight points. The Ohio State lead reached 13 points, 27-14, before Youngstown State got as close as nine, but it then went the final 6:34 of the first half without a made field goal. However, the Penguins did sink five free throws during that stretch.  Ohio State opened the second half on an 8-2 run to build a 45-24 cushion, then led by at least 20 the rest of the way.  Because a power outage on the Youngstown State campus postponed the Penguins' season opener against Westminster last Monday, the team will begin the season with six straight games away from home for the first time in program history. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

In last season's inaugural edition of the NBA Cup, then called the NBA In-Season Tournament, Phoenix advanced from the five-team group at 3-1 to reach the knockout round. Utah finished third in the group at 2-2. Through the first few weeks of this regular season, the Jazz struggled to an 0-6 start -- the franchise's worst opening stretch since going 0-8 in 2013-14. Utah tips off the NBA Cup having won two of three games, however, coming off a 111-110 decision in San Antonio on Saturday. Collin Sexton's free throws with 3.2 seconds gave Utah a necessary buffer, as Devin Vassell hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Sexton finished with a team-high 23 points, as the Jazz improved to 2-1 this season when he notches 20-plus points. Sexton scored 24 in the 135-126 win at Chicago on Nov. 4. Lauri Markkanen scored 20 points in his second game back in the lineup after leaving the Oct. 29 loss to Sacramento with back spasms. Rookie forward Kyle Filipowski played a strong all-around game against the Spurs with eight points, six assists and five rebounds. ""He's very comfortable with the ball in his hands,"" Jazz coach Will Hardy said of Filipowski, per the Deseret News. ""It gives us a lot of (options) on offense, especially when he's out there with John (Collins) and Lauri."" Fellow Utah rookie guard Isaiah Collier, helping fill in with Keyonte George out with a foot injury, had seven points, six rebounds and four assists in his second NBA game. While Utah tips off the NBA Cup coming off of just its second win on the season, Phoenix begins group play coming off of only its second loss. The Suns lost to visiting Sacramento 127-118 in overtime, snapping their seven-game winning streak. Devin Booker scored 28 points, Bradley Beal added 23 and Tyus Jones recorded a season-high 22 to shoulder the bulk of the offensive load with Kevin Durant sidelined.   Durant sustained a left calf strain in Phoenix's 114-113 win over Dallas on Friday. The team announced the 11-time All-NBA forward will miss at least the next two weeks. Beal, who has been dealing with an elbow sprain, also collided with DeMar DeRozan on Sunday and underwent an X-ray on his left knee following the game. Results from the X-ray returned negative. Beal's incident came after Jusuf Nurkic exited the game with an ankle injury. ""Our depth definitely got tested with Nurk going out,"" Suns coach Mike Budenholzer said.  Veteran reserve Mason Plumlee, who Budenholzer said has been ""very good"" for Phoenix this season, came on to provide six points, 11 rebounds and six assists. Fellow reserve Josh Okogie added nine points and five rebounds. Regardless of the status of Beal or Nurkic for Tuesday, Budenholzer is still looking for continued contributions from the bench. ""We've been talking about how positive we are on Oso (Ighodaro),"" Budenholzer said. ""Josh has done it now for two games in a row. ...

Conversely, the Edmonton Oilers' third-period outburst on Saturday provided a hint they might finally be ready to return to form. The former tries to bounce back and the latter aims to build momentum Tuesday night when New York visits Edmonton in the first clash of the season between the teams. Neither team has played since Saturday. The host Islanders squandered a two-goal lead in the third period and fell to the New Jersey Devils 4-3 in overtime. The visiting Oilers ended a two-game losing streak by scoring four goals in fewer than five minutes in the third period of a 7-3 win over the Vancouver Canucks. The loss snapped a season-high two-game winning streak for the Islanders, who appeared headed for victory when Dennis Cholowski and Brock Nelson scored within a stretch of 1:56 shortly beyond the midway point of the third period. But Dawson Mercer scored with 4:27 left for the Devils, who pulled goalie Jacob Markstrom with about 1:18 remaining and tied the score when Stefan Noesen's pass into the crease glanced off the stick and skate of Islanders defenseman Grant Hutton and trickled past Ilya Sorokin, who finished with 29 saves. Jack Hughes scored on a breakaway 2:35 into overtime to hand the Islanders their 14th loss -- counting the playoffs -- in games in which they led in the third period over the last two seasons. New York, which frittered away several one-goal leads in a 5-4 overtime loss to the Utah Hockey Club on Oct. 10, also gave up third-period advantages in a shootout win over the Montreal Canadiens on Oct. 19 and in an overtime victory over the Devils on Oct. 25. ""We managed to take a 3-1 lead. Unfortunately, we couldn't close,"" Islanders coach Patrick Roy said. ""Need to find a way to close those games."" Closing wasn't a problem Saturday for the Oilers, who led 3-0 fewer than five minutes into the second before the Canucks' Elias Pettersson and Filip Hronek scored twice in a span of 1:59. Connor Brown opened and closed the third-period flurry for the Oilers, who received goals in between from Connor McDavid and Brett Kulak. The four-goal third was the most prolific period of the season for Edmonton, which scored fewer than four goals in nine of its first 14 games. The win was the fifth in the last eight games for the defending Western Conference champion Oilers, who were a popular preseason pick to win the Stanley Cup but opened with five losses in their first seven games (2-4-1). ""It was a solid effort by our group, but the main thing is that third period, the way we showed composure and poise in the third and made plays with the lead and piled on,"" Brown said. ""I think there's a lot of momentum to be built off that game, especially that third period."" The Oilers will visit the Islanders on March 14 to conclude the two-game season series. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

He died in Baton Rouge, La., from complications stemming from pneumonia. Robinson compiled a 104-35-4 record over two separate tenures as head football coach at USC, winning a national championship with the Trojans in 1978. The 104 wins put him at third place in all-time wins at the school behind John McKay and Howard Jones. Robinson never had a losing season at USC in 12 seasons. His first team, in 1976, went 11-1 and won the Rose Bowl, finishing No. 2 in the AP poll. After a dip to 8-4 in 1977, Robinson put together a two-year run of 23-1-1 in 1978-79, winning two more Rose Bowls and a national championship as designated by the coaches' poll in 1978. He coached another three seasons during that first tenure, producing such noted NFL stars as Marcus Allen, Ricky Bell, Charles White, Clay Matthews and Joey Browner. Allen and White both won the Heisman Trophy while playing for Robinson. In 1983, Robinson was handed the reins to the Los Angeles Rams and twice advanced to the NFC Championship Game in his tenure there (1983-1991), going 75-68. The Trojans re-hired Robinson for the 1993 season. While his second stint at USC did not produce the same highs, he did earn three more bowl wins over five seasons, including wins in the Cotton Bowl and Rose Bowl. His head coaching career wrapped in Las Vegas with UNLV, where he went 28-42 over six years. He also became a consultant with LSU and was present for the Tigers' national title in 2019. Overall, Robinson finished with an 8-1 record in bowl games over 18 seasons as a head coach. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Nittany Lions also boast a 48-16 advantage in fast-break points. ""This is who we are and this is how we have to go about doing it,"" said second-year Penn State coach Mike Rhoades. ""The kids are confident in doing it. When you go out there, let your hair down and good things will happen."" Northern Illinois transfer Yanic Konan Niederhauser led five players in double figures during Friday night's 103-54 rout of UMBC, scoring 18 points and grabbing nine rebounds. The Nittany Lions sank 55.2 percent of their field-goal attempts, including 10 of 23 3-pointers, and collected 21 assists. Niederhauser and Zach Hicks are each averaging 17 ppg, with D'Marco Dunn supplying 14 ppg off the bench. Meanwhile, St. Francis enters with a 1-2 mark after rallying from an 11-point halftime deficit Sunday for a 65-64 win at Campbell. Valentino Pinedo capped the comeback by hitting a foul shot with two seconds left for the last of his career-high 15 points. ""It was great to win a game early in the season where we didn't fill up the stat sheet,"" Red Flash coach Rob Krimmel said. ""We played with more purpose and togetherness in the second half. We executed the game plan much better on both ends."" Ace Talbert leads the team in scoring at 11.7 ppg through three games, while Bobby Rosenberger is chipping in 10 ppg. Penn State has won the last six meetings in the series, including an 83-53 victory last season at home. St. Francis' last win in the series came in 1978. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Each league's trio of finalists were revealed on Monday night. Skenes, the star Pittsburgh Pirates right-handed pitcher, is up against Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Jackson Chourio and San Diego Padres outfielder Jackson Merrill. Skenes is the leading candidate in the National League after claiming the award from multiple publications since the end of his first season.  The No. 1 pick in the 2023 MLB Draft, Skenes was promoted from the minors to the Pirates' rotation on May 11. He led baseball in ERA from that point forward and became the fifth rookie pitcher to start the All-Star Game.  Skenes, 22, was 11-3 with a 1.96 ERA, 170 strikeouts and 0.95 WHIP in 2024. Merrill had 162 hits in 156 games, batting .292 with 61 extra-base hits (24 home runs, 31 doubles, six triples) and 90 RBIs. Chourio, in his first year in the big leagues for Milwaukee, batted .275 with 21 homers, 79 RBIs and 22 stolen bases in 148 games, splitting his time between left and right field. A starting pitcher is also favored on the AL side. Yankees right-hander Luis Gil, who had seven career appearances before 2024, quickly earned a spot in the team's starting rotation and finished the year with a 15-7 record, a 3.50 ERA, 171 strikeouts and a league-high 77 walks in 151 2/3 innings. He had 17 starts with one run or zero runs allowed. His New York batterymate Austin Wells appeared in 115 games and hit .229 with 13 homers and 55 RBIs. The third AL finalist is Baltimore Orioles outfielder Colton Cowser, who became an everyday player for the O's and batted .242 with 24 homers and 69 RBIs in 153 games. MLB will announce the winners in both leagues on Nov. 18.  Gil and Skenes were named rookies of the year in their respective leagues by Baseball Digest earlier this month.

Quatraro, 50, oversaw a stunning turnaround for the Royals, who were coming off a lifeless 56-106 last-place finish in 2023. A similar roster in 2024 became a winning squad under Quatraro's direction, going 86-76 with a second-place finish in the American League Central. This year's Royals earned a 2-0 sweep of the Baltimore Orioles in the AL wild-card series before dropping an AL Division Series to the New York Yankees three games to one. Quatraro will have stiff competition in the AL from two divisional rivals, A.J. Hinch of the Detroit Tigers and Stephen Vogt of the Cleveland Guardians. Hinch matched Quatraro by directing an 86-76 club that found postseason success. Hinch's Tigers swept the Houston Astros 2-0 in the other AL wild-card series and pushed the Guardians to five games in the ALDS before losing 3-2. Meanwhile, the first-place Guardians and Vogt had the most successful season of the bunch, winning 92 games and taking that postseason series with Detroit to make their first AL Championship Series since 2016. They lost in five games (4-1) to the Yankees. The nominees for the award in the National League were Pat Murphy of the Milwaukee Brewers, Mike Shildt of the San Diego Padres and Carlos Mendoza of the New York Mets. Murphy and Shildt each helmed 93-69 squads that made the postseason. While Murphy saw his season come to an end at the hands of Mendoza's 89-73 Mets, Shildt piloted the Padres to a 2-0 wild-card series win over the Atlanta Braves. Mendoza's squad went on to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies 3-1 in an NL Division Series to make the NL Championship Series, their first since 2015. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

South Carolina fell to North Florida in its opener before bouncing back with an 86-64 rout of South Carolina State on Friday. Jacobi Wright scored a career-best 20 points and Collin Murray-Boyles had 19 points and a career-high 16 rebounds. Murray-Boyles leads the Gamecocks in scoring (17 points per game) and rebounding (11.5). Wright is averaging 16 points on 72.2 percent shooting (13-of-18) and a team-best 4.5 assists. Wright also knocked down four 3-pointers against South Carolina State. ""Jacobi Wright, just in his DNA as a basketball player, is the kind of guy who's going to do those things more often,"" South Carolina coach Lamont Paris said of Wright. The Gamecocks never trailed, boasted a 51-36 rebounding edge and held South Carolina State to 3-of-16 shooting from 3-point range. But Paris wasn't pleased with his own team's long-range shooting. South Carolina was 8-of-27 -- Wright was 4-of-7 and the rest of the team was 4-of-20. ""I can't make them make it,"" Paris said. ""All I can do is provide the environment that they feel comfortable taking those shots."" Towson (1-1) split its first two games, losing at Saint Mary's in its opener before shellacking USCAA member Penn State Wilkes-Barre 89-34 on Friday. Tomiwa Sulaiman made a career-high six points while scoring 20 points and Tyler Tejada added 15. The Tigers made 14 3-pointers, two shy of the school record. Tejada leads Towson with a 16.5 scoring average and Dylan Williamson is contributing 12.5 per game. The Tigers would certainly like to post an attention-grabbing victory after stringing together three straight seasons of 20 or more wins. Towson hasn't played in the NCAA Tournament since 1991 but this group has made it a goal to end the long drought. ""We're going to take it one day at a time, one game at a time,"" Tigers guard Nendah Tarke recently said. ""We know that that's our end goal. We're far from that now, but if we keep up with the right habits and doing the right things, everything should take care of itself."" This is the third meeting between the schools. South Carolina won both of the first two with the most recent matchup being a 65-55 victory on Dec. 30, 1997. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Following the Utes' 22-21 home loss to rival BYU on Saturday night that dropped Utah to 4-5 and 1-5 in the conference, Harlan unloaded on the officiating and the conference itself. ""This game was absolutely stolen from us,"" Harlan said. ""We were excited about being in the Big 12, but tonight I am not. We won this game. Someone else stole it from us. Very disappointed."" Those comments led to a fairly swift reaction from the league, which reprimanded Harlan with the fine and a statement Sunday. ""Mark's comments irresponsibly challenged the professionalism of our officials and the integrity of the Big 12 Conference,"" Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark said. ""There is a right way and a wrong way to voice concerns. Unfortunately, Mark chose the wrong way. Accordingly, this violation warrants a public reprimand and financial penalty. The Big 12 Conference prioritizes professionalism, integrity, and fairness, and will continue to do so."" Down 21-19, a holding penalty called on Utah cornerback Zemaiah Vaughn on fourth down negated a sack and gave BYU the ball at its own 19 with about 90 seconds left. The Cougars then drove down the field for a game-winning 44-yard field goal. With the win, which came before the largest crowd (54,383) ever at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, No. 9 BYU moved to 9-0, 6-0 in the conference, to stay firmly in the mix for a College Football Playoff berth. ""I recognize that there are more appropriate times and avenues to express those concerns, and I accept the consequences of my decision,"" Harlan said in a statement. ""My comments came after having just left our team locker room where our student-athletes were hurting and upset. The University of Utah is proud to be a member of the Big 12 Conference and we look forward to working with our peers to continue to enhance the league."" The game was the first between the two as conference mates since 2010 when both teams left the Mountain West Conference. Utah joined the Big 12 along with three other Pac-12 teams this summer.

The Friars (2-0) are coming off a 76-49 win Saturday over nearby Stonehill in which 11 different players scored, led by Georgia graduate transfer Jabri Abdur-Rahim's 16 points and six rebounds. Coach Kim English's team is still coming together after dealing with injuries throughout the preseason. All-Big East star Bryce Hopkins has been out since January due to an ACL tear. ""Guys are still fighting for rotational minutes -- and that's without Bryce Hopkins, who you can plug in (for) high-20s, low-30s per game,"" English said. ""The starting group, we're still evaluating. ... We're looking to see who can play that hard on defense and be efficient on offense."" The deep lineup shot 50 percent from the field, a big improvement from the 37.7 percent mark in last Monday's 59-55 win over Central Connecticut State. Meanwhile, English is hopeful for a Hopkins return during the Friars' Thanksgiving week trip to the Battle 4 Atlantis in the Bahamas. ""I'm wanting him to do more. He's kind of in a dilemma of wanting to get in but also wanting the guys that are going to play to get reps,"" English said. ""His legs are strong, his knee is strong."" Miami transfer Bensley Joseph leads Providence with 14 points per game, including 21 points and five 3-pointers against Central Connecticut. Tuesday marks Hampton's (1-1) second game against a Division I foe this season after it fell 82-54 on Friday at George Washington. George Beale Jr., a junior transfer from Norfolk State, scored a game-high 19 points on 8-of-14 shooting. Beale has 17 points per game for a Pirates team that boasts just one returning starter in Kyrese Mullen, whose 10 double-doubles led the Coastal Athletic Association last season.

For the Raptors, coming off a 25-win season last year, it's not a surprise to see them where they are in the standings, but the struggles of the 2-8 Bucks are one of the talks of the early season. ""We gotta get out of this hole that we created,"" Bucks coach Doc Rivers said after his team's loss to the Boston Celtics Sunday. ""We created it. All of us, me, them, together. I have no doubt that we will. We have to play ourselves out of this hole."" The Bucks wasted another sensational performance from Giannis Antetokounmpo Sunday against the Celtics. He had 43 points and leads the NBA averaging 31.6 points a game, boosting that average to 33.8 over his last five. Damian Lillard was held to 14 points by the Celtics, well off his 26-point average. Rivers appears frustrated by his team's issues, especially the variables of pace and effort. ""We can't sustain what we did like we did in the Cleveland game. We came out like gangbusters and we just didn't sustain our play,"" Rivers said. ""It's my job to make sure we keep going and playing at the right pace. We didn't do that."" The Bucks do expect the third piece of their Big Three back soon. Rivers said Khris Middleton has been ramping up his activity level after suffering an ankle injury. Injuries have been a big theme for the Raptors, who have lost four straight on a five-game road trip that ends Tuesday. Bruce Brown is out with a knee injury, and Scottie Barnes is out until at least Thanksgiving with an orbital fracture. Raptors lead guard RJ Barrett missed three games with an injury but has played well since his return. Immanuel Quickley missed eight games with a pelvis injury and Raptors coach Darko Rajakovic said the two are still getting used to one another. ""It's just a different role in different situations for both of them,"" Rajakovic said. ""They are learning how to play off of each other. They are learning how to play again with Jakob (Poeltl). We're still playing quickly. We have to use this as a learning opportunity. We have one more game on this road trip."" The Raptors lead the NBA in 2-point shooting percentage at 65.1, and Poeltl is averaging a double-double, but Toronto has a defensive rating of 120.0, worst in the NBA. While it seems like it's getting late early for the Bucks, Toronto entered the year with measured expectations and there's no talk of digging out of a hole. ""It's hard to make any conclusions after 10-11 games,"" Rajakovic said. ""We still have guys dealing with injuries. We are really investing in developing the young players that we have."" The NBA Cup is an in-season tournament in its second season. Milwaukee went 4-0 in group play last year and lost in the semifinals to Indiana. Toronto went 1-3 in NBA Cup play. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""We'll look at what we're doing sports science-wise, but we'll come up with answers,"" Montgomery said. ""Right now, I don't have an answer for you."" The exploration will continue when the Bruins visit the struggling St. Louis Blues on Tuesday night. Boston is coming off a 3-2 overtime loss to the visiting Ottawa Senators on Saturday night. The Bruins, 1-1-1 in their last three games, were outshot 12-0 in the third period. ""It's up for you guys to figure that out and come up with a reason,"" Montgomery told reporters after the loss. ""We just weren't good enough. You guys can write what you guys think is the malaise on the team and what's going wrong. We're just not playing good enough."" Captain Brad Marchand noted that Boston is reacting to the play rather than initiating it. ""Sometimes when you lack confidence or you're overthinking, your execution is slow,"" Marchand said. ""We need to get out of our heads. Stop thinking and start playing. It comes down to will and compete at this point. We need to understand we need to be better. That's part of it. Sometimes when you're thinking about where you're supposed to be, you're half a second late. That's too slow in this league."" The Bruins are near the bottom of the NHL offensively, averaging 2.5 goals per game. Their power play is converting at 12.5 percent, tied for second worst in the league entering Monday. Fortunately for the Bruins, they face the team with the NHL's least effective power play -- the Blues. The injury-depleted Blues are connecting on just 10.8 percent of their power-play chances and are just head of the Bruins in goals per game (2.53). Playing without top center Robert Thomas (broken ankle) and top-four defensemen Philip Broberg and Nick Leddy (both sidelined by lower-body injuries), the Blues have fallen into a funk. The Blues' 8-1 loss to the Washington Capitals on Saturday night was their fifth defeat in their last seven games, dropping them below .500 at 7-8-0. St, Louis collapsed in the third period, allowing five goals. ""You can't sugarcoat it when you let in eight,"" Blues captain Brayden Schenn said. ""It just boils down to being in a hockey game, being able to come back from 3-1, to letting in five in the third period. It's just absolutely unacceptable."" It was the second time in two weeks the Blues suffered an 8-1 loss. After they lost by seven at Ottawa on Oct. 29, they rebounded to win two of their next three while allowing two goals per game over that span. ""We bounce back with some good efforts but we haven't been able to sustain it,"" coach Drew Bannister said. ""We have to be able to sustain playing better hockey. We can't take one or two steps forward and then keep taking these steps back. Our consistency when we're playing well, we have to be able to maintain that."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Off to the best 15-game start in NHL history, the Jets attempt to push their winning streak to seven games Tuesday night when they visit the New York Rangers. The Jets are the first team to win 14 of their opening 15 games in NHL history and are five points up on the Florida Panthers and Minnesota Wild in the early race for the league's top point total. Winnipeg kept its streak going with a 4-1 home win over the Dallas Stars on Saturday afternoon and is outscoring foes 27-9 in its second lengthy winning streak this season. The Jets scored at least four goals for the 10th time this season and won by at least three for the eighth time. Alex Iafallo and Nikolaj Ehlers scored power-play goals as the Jets raised their NHL-best power-play percentage to 41.9 percent and scored multiple times on the power play for the fifth game. ""I'm pretty amazed a little bit,"" Jets coach Scott Arniel said. ""At the same time, these players, they do have to recognize that it's an amazing feat, what they've done so far. But we'd like to just keep this going a little bit longer. They've got to be awfully proud of what they've done."" The power play is not the only thing clicking for the Jets, whose 67 goals are the most in the NHL. Mark Scheifele has nine of his 19 points (seven goals, two assists) in a seven-game points streak while goalie Connor Hellebuyck went a franchise-record 191:47 without allowing a goal until giving up a late tally on Saturday. The Jets scored 11 times in that span. Winnipeg put together its quick start playing nine of its games at home, and Tuesday's visit to the reigning President's Trophy winners starts a stretch of nine out of 10 games on the road. The Rangers are still trying to find the form that led them to the top mark last season. While they are off to a 9-3-1 start, the Rangers have been outshot in seven of their games and gone 5-2-0 in those games. The latest instance was Saturday's 4-0 win over the Detroit Red Wings, two nights after a 6-1 home loss to the Buffalo Sabres. Backup goalie Jonathan Quick made 37 saves against Detroit in a game when the Rangers were outshot 37-23.  That occurred a little over a week after the Rangers were outshot by sizable margins against the Washington Capitals and Ottawa Senators. ""It's good to get two points and get the win, get back on track,"" Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said. ""I thought the third period was our best period. First period, we got going a little bit toward the end. I thought in the first period and the second period wasn't very good but overall, the bounce-back and getting a win is good."" New York scored two goals late in the second period, when allowed 19 shots on goal. Jimmy Vesey and Artemi Panarin scored 48 seconds apart while Chris Kreider added a power-play goal in the opening period. Quick earned the shutout after relieving Igor Shesterkin on Thursday but the Rangers' star goaltender is expected to start after giving up five goals on 12 shots against Buffalo. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The teams also will square off in the Sunshine State on Thursday. Bennett scored a goal in Florida's 4-3 shootout victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday to boost his season point total to 15 (nine goals, six assists) in 15 games. He trails only Sam Reinhart in goals (11) and points (23) on the team. Speaking of Reinhart, he notched an assist on defenseman Dmitry Kulikov's goal in the second period on Saturday to extend his point streak to seven games (six goals, five assists). Reinhart also torched New Jersey in 2023-24, scoring four goals to help the Panthers win two of the three games in the season series. Evan Rodrigues had a pair of assists before scoring the deciding goal in the fifth round of the shootout versus the Flyers. Captain Aleksander Barkov has produced two goals and nine assists since returning from a lower-body injury on Oct. 28. Sergei Bobrovsky has won five straight starts since being pulled after yielding five goals in two periods against the Minnesota Wild on Oct. 22. The two-time Vezina Trophy recipient boasts a sterling 20-7-1 record in 29 career appearances versus the Devils. For its part, New Jersey was unable to solve former Devils netminder Mackenzie Blackwood in a 1-0 setback to the San Jose Sharks on Sunday. New Jersey had won three in a row and five its previous six games before Blackwood recorded 44 saves in the shutout. ""They've got a fast, skilled team, and they have been playing well of late,"" Devils backup goaltender Jake Allen said after his 26-save performance. ""Coming off (Saturday's 4-3 overtime win versus the New York Islanders), we wanted to keep this stretch going here. Now we'll take time to regroup. It's going to be a tough test this week, a tough challenge."" Jesper Bratt was denied on a partial breakaway during the final minute of the second period on Sunday. Bratt, who leads the team in assists (14) and points (19), had three and five, respectively, in three games versus Florida last season. Jack Hughes registered eight shots on goal on Sunday after recording back-to-back three-point performances. The top overall pick of the 2019 NHL Draft sits one point shy of 300 in his young career. Devils No. 1 goaltender Jacob Markstrom has won four of his last five starts, posting a 2.00 goals-against average and a .919 save percentage. In 11 games (10 starts) against Florida, he is 5-5-1 with a 3.08 GAA and a .909 save percentage. The Devils have killed off 19 consecutive penalties heading into their three-game stretch in the Sunshine State.

Indianapolis is only two games behind Houston in the standings, but has already lost both meetings against the Texans this season. Flacco played for the Jets from 2020-22, and Sunday will present a matchup against 40-year-old counterpart Aaron Rodgers. Meanwhile, the 22-year-old Richardson remains the backup, having played in only 10 career NFL games. The No. 4 overall pick in the 2023 draft, he is last in the NFL in completion percentage at 44.4 percent with seven interceptions. ""You've gotta go through the process every single day,"" Steichen said when asked where things stand with Richardson. ""And that's where it's at. He's a great person, phenomenal human being.

Covering the WTA Finals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Friday, Wertheim said in a statement on Sunday that his comment ""inadvertently"" made it on air after he joined the Tennis Channel broadcast via Zoom. ""In rehearsal we were shown a graphic of a player who had just competed. It showed her at an angle that exaggerated her forehead,"" Wertheim wrote on X on Sunday. ""A few moments later, I was told to frame up my Zoom. ""I looked at the low camera angle and joked that it made my forehead resemble the photo of the player in question. Someone in the control room chimed in and I bantered back. Though this was a private rehearsal, this exchange inadvertently, and without context, made it to live air. ""I realize: I am not the victim here. It was neither professional nor charitable nor reflective of the person I strive to be. I am accountable. I own this. I am sorry."" In a statement on Sunday regarding Wertheim's removal from on-air broadcasts, the Tennis Channel said it had apologized to Krejcikova, who lost in the semifinals of the WTA Finals to Zheng Qinwen. Wertheim said he has reached out to the 2024 Wimbledon champion to apologize. ""I made some deeply regrettable comments off-air. I acknowledge them. I apologize for them,"" he wrote on X. A two-time Grand Slam champion and the world No. 10, Krejcikova called for ""respect and professionalism"" from the media covering the sports world. ""You might have heard about the recent comments made on Tennis Channel during the WTA Finals coverage that focused on my appearance rather than my performance,"" Krejcikova wrote on X. ""As an athlete who has dedicated herself to this sport, it was disappointing to see this type of unprofessional commentary. ""This isn't the first time something like this is happening in sports world. I've often chosen not to speak up, but I believe it's time to address the need for respect and professionalism in sports media."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Giants fell to 2-8 with Sunday's last-second loss to Carolina in Germany, a game in which quarterback Daniel Jones threw for 190 yards on no touchdowns while getting intercepted twice and posting a paltry 33.9 quarterback rating.  New York has now lost five consecutive games to fall into a tie with Jacksonville for the worst record in the NFL. ""We're going to spend a lot of time here watching our tape and evaluating things. We'll do that as a coaching staff over the next week here,"" Daboll said on Monday when asked if Jones is still the starting quarterback. Jones has completed 63.3 percent of his passes for 2,070 yards and eight touchdowns against seven interceptions. He was benched for Drew Lock in the second half of a 28-3 loss to Philadelphia in Week 7, but Daboll has stuck with Jones as his starter for each of the ensuing three losses. When pressed on why he declined to commit to Jones as he has in previous weeks, Daboll offered only that, ""I would say we're evaluating our team at the bye week is what we're doing.""  In addition to Lock, the Giants have former undrafted free agent Tommy DeVito on the roster. DeVito, who played in nine games after Jones suffered a season-ending knee injury last year, has yet to appear in a game this season. ""We're going to get started on this process here of going back and looking at everything you normally look at in a bye week,"" Daboll said. ""Schemes, situational stuff, technique, all the things you do in a normal bye week. You evaluate the players. You have a good amount of games to watch. Situational review tape, calls, all those types of things.  ""We'll do that like we normally do on a bye week and try to improve in the areas that we need to improve on."" Jones signed a four-year, $160 million contract during the 2023 offseason that includes $92 million in guaranteed money. He is due to earn $30 million in base salary next season, with $12 million becoming fully guaranteed on the fifth day of the league season. If the team is considering moving on from Jones after this season, his $23 million injury guarantee could prompt a change to Lock or DeVito. Daboll acknowledged that he's in communication with general manager Joe Schoen and the team's ownership group on ""a daily basis"" regarding every position. ""I think that's very important and healthy for the organization,"" he said. ""If there's changes we need to make, we'll make them. Again, you only have about a week to do this and look at things. But you're always doing that throughout the season after a game. It's just here, you've got some more information. You've got back-to-back-to-back of cutups of things you want to look at. Practices, meeting times, all those types of things. Then you make the necessary adjustments that you think you need to make.  ""How drastic? I couldn't give you that answer.

Atlanta entered the rivalry game undefeated against NFC South opponents, and had won five of six overall. The Saints had lost seven in a row and were playing their first game following the firing of head coach Dennis Allen. Perhaps the biggest surprise was the way Atlanta lost. Despite outgaining the Saints 468-365, the Falcons scored on just three of their 11 drives, and usually reliable kicker Younghoe Koo missed three field goals. Koo, whose 58-yard field goal with seconds to spare beat the Saints on Sep. 29, missed from 53 and 35 yards out in the second quarter, before hitting the upright on what would have been a game-tying 46 yarder with 6:43 left in the fourth. Although kickers are known to have short leashes in the NFL, Atlanta head coach Raheem Morris' belief in Koo remains strong. ""When you talk about Younghoe Koo, you're talking about the guy who hit a 52-yard field goal to send a game to overtime against Tampa, you're talking about a guy who won the game last time we played New Orleans with a walk-off,"" Morris said in Monday's press conference. ""You're talking about a guy that's been clutch for us over the last couple of years in big moments. ""There's going to be times that you don't have the success that you want to have. We still have a lot of football to play, so those percentages will go back up, I believe, because of who he is, what he is and what he's all about."" Atlanta (6-4) still has a two-game lead on the Buccaneers for control of the NFC South. The Falcons now prepare for another playoff hopeful as they travel to Denver for the first time since 2016 to take on the 5-5 Broncos. Denver had the 8-0 Kansas City Chiefs on the ropes Sunday, but Wil Lutz had his 35-yard field goal blocked as time expired, and the Broncos fell 16-14. The 20-point mark has been the key for Atlanta's offense, as the Falcons are 6-0 when reaching that total and 0-4 when they don't. Morris is confident that the unit can replicate its success this week, despite Denver's stingy defense. ""I've got so much respect for (Denver defensive coordinator) Vance Joseph and what they've been able to do on defense. It's been really fun to watch,"" Morris said. ""But I've got so many expectations for our offense, and our ability to execute at a high level. From Darnell Mooney to Bijan Robinson, Tyler Allgeier, to Kyle Pitts, Drake London, we've all seen them do things at the highest level. ... Along with our coaches and being able to orchestrate a game plan to go out there and attack any weaknesses they have in Denver. I've got a lot of confidence going out there."" On the injury front, Morris said cornerback Mike Hughes (neck) has been cleared after leaving Sunday's game with the injury and undergoing an MRI Monday. The Falcons are more worried about defensive lineman Ta'Quon Graham, who suffered a pectoral muscle injury and did not return. Meanwhile, linebacker Troy Andersen (knee) made his long-awaited return from a five-game injury absence but Morris revealed that Andersen reaggravated the injury during the Saints game. ""But we'll get the chance to re-evaluate him today and tomorrow,"" Morris said, ""do some of the things of that nature."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter took advantage of Miami's first loss of the season to vault into the favorite seat for the first time this season. Hunter, who caught nine passes for 99 yards and a touchdown in addition to his regular duty as a shutdown corner in Colorado's 41-27 win at Texas Tech on Saturday, is the +130 Heisman Trophy favorite at DraftKings. Hunter has supplanted Hurricanes quarterback Cam Ward, who tumbled to +800 after Miami was upset at Georgia Tech. He is now also behind Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty (+300) and Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel (+330). Each of those three have spent at least two weeks as the favorite at different points during the season. They now all find themselves trying to chase down Hunter, who was a +2000 longshot just three weeks ago. After two games in which he caught a combined five passes for 43 yards, Hunter has been heavily featured in the Buffaloes' passing attack in wins over Cincinnati and Texas Tech. Saturday night's nine catches came after Hunter torched the Bearcats for 153 receiving yards and a pair of touchdowns ahead of Colorado's bye week. The Buffs host Utah on Saturday before traveling to Kansas, then return home to close out the regular season against Oklahoma State before a potential date in the Big 12 championship game.

Jeanty's odds shortened -200 after rushing for 209 yards and three touchdowns in Boise State's 28-21 win over Nevada. Ward suffered the biggest drop among the contenders, seeing his odds lengthen by +600. Sanders' lengthened +500 and Dart's +400 despite leading both of their teams to key victories on Saturday. The Heisman Trophy race has seen significant movement on a weekly basis throughout the season. Should No. 1 Oregon run the table undefeated in the Big Ten, it will likely be difficult for Hunter and Jeanty to hold off Gabriel, who has spent multiple stints atop the Heisman picture this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Duwelius, who has worked for the Lynx since 2014, will join Unrivaled, the new 3-on-3 professional women's league, as GM and executive vice president. Lynx star Napheesa Collier co-founded Unrivaled, which will begin its first season in January in Miami. Duwelius, who began her tenure with the Lynx as basketball operations coordinator before moving up in the front office, became GM when head coach Cheryl Reeve was named president of basketball operations in 2022. Meanwhile, Smith is returning to her alma mater, Ohio State, to serve as an assistant coach. Smith played from 1992-96 and helped the Buckeyes reach the national title game in 1993. After two championship seasons with Columbus of the ABL, Smith was a seven-time All-Star during her 15 seasons in the WNBA -- including 6 1/2 seasons with the Lynx -- and was a two-time champion with Detroit. A member of the Naismith, Women's Basketball and Ohio State halls of fame, Smith is also a three-time U.S. Olympic gold medalist. Before joining the Lynx's staff in 2020, she was the head coach of the Liberty for two seasons.

Matthews (upper-body injury) is eligible to come off injured reserve on Tuesday but did not participate in practice on Monday. Toronto will be without Max Pacioretty (lower-body injury), who was placed on IR after he left Saturday's 4-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens. While Pacioretty is considered week-to-week, Matthews continues to be classified as day-to-day. ""We want to make sure we get ahead of it and hopefully get it behind us once and for all,"" Maple Leafs general manager Brad Treliving said on Monday. ""(Matthews) will remain day-to-day. I would say he is doubtful for (Tuesday) but he skated Saturday and Sunday, so we'll keep going down that path."" Matthews led the league last season with 69 goals and has five this season in 13 games. William Nylander and Max Domi also did not practice on Monday for what was termed a maintenance day. They are expected to play Tuesday. Mitchell Marner had a goal and an assist against Montreal to extend his points streak to eight games (three goals, 10 assists). Morgan Rielly had an assist, joining Borje Salming and Tomas Kaberle as the only Maple Leafs defensemen to record 400 NHL assists. Toronto's power play continues to surge after a 4-for-40 start. The Leafs went 2-for-4 on Saturday and are 11-for-53 on the season. ""I thought we checked extremely well for two periods,"" coach Craig Berube said. ""The power play was good again. Clean pretty much with penalties and I thought we played a real smart game. I was really happy. Third period they made a little push but our goalie (Joseph Woll) was really good for us."" The Senators won for the second time in five games Saturday, posting a 3-2 overtime road victory over the Boston Bruins. The Senators improved to 2-5-0 on the road on Saturday when Brady Tkachuk scored 21 seconds into overtime. It was his 12th shot on goal. ""I think the last two games for myself, individually, I haven't liked the way I've been playing with the puck,"" said Tkachuk, who also had an assist. ""It's just something that I want to focus on, that every time I have an opportunity to shoot -- that I'm pretty confident in my shot -- that every time I have the puck on my stick, that has a chance to go in, so I have to start utilizing that more."" Senators coach Travis Green was impressed with his team's performance from start to finish. ""We've challenged our guys the last couple days here to play more consistent,"" Green said. ""Play faster, play harder, and they responded in a really good game for 60 minutes."" ""We really showed what kind of team we are,"" said Ottawa goaltender Linus Ullmark, who made 14 saves against his former team. ""It's a statement game, so to speak.

Tuesday's game is part of the NBA Cup, which features six groups of five teams. The Sixers and Knicks are part of East Group A, along with the Brooklyn Nets, Orlando Magic and Charlotte Hornets. The group-play contest also is a showdown between two squads off to a slow start. Philadelphia's plan to showcase the dynamic trio of Embiid, Tyrese Maxey and Paul George had been put on the backburner. Embiid missed the entire preseason and the first nine regular-season games -- first while managing left knee soreness and more recently due to a three-game suspension for shoving a reporter. George (knee) sat out the first five games and has played the last four, but not long after he returned, Maxey had a hamstring injury that will sideline him for multiple weeks. The availability issues have left the Sixers in an early-season funk. They blew a 16-point fourth-quarter lead Sunday against Charlotte before recovering to win 107-105 in overtime to snap a five-game losing streak. ""We should still be playing at a high level and competing, trying to win games,"" George said. ""But no doubt about it, you get somebody back like (Embiid), it'll make everybody's job a little easier."" Embiid averaged a career-high 34.7 points and 11.0 rebounds while being limited to 39 games due to injury last season. He had a terrific shooting year from the field (52.9 percent), the 3-point arc (38.8 percent) and the foul line (88.3), all while averaging career highs in assists (5.6) and steals (1.2). ""I mean, obviously, we're not where we want to be without the big fella,"" George said. ""Someone as talented as him ... obviously, he's the (missing) piece."" Embiid's first challenge will be to exact some revenge on the Knicks, who eliminated the Sixers in the first round of last season's playoffs. New York's Jalen Brunson averaged 35.5 points and 9.0 assists in that six-game series, while Josh Hart (16.8 points, 12.3 rebounds, 4.5 assists), was all over the court. Embiid averaged 33.0 points and 10.8 rebounds, while Maxey scored in 29.8 points per contest. ""We're resilient,"" Brunson said after New York finished off Philadelphia in Game 6. ""No matter what the outside people say, positive or negative, we know what we've got to do. We're going to stick together and that's not going to change with us. I like that that's how we think."" The Knicks' resilience has been put to the test already this season. New York has dropped three of its last four games -- including double-digit defeats against the Houston Rockets and Indiana Pacers. Brunson (33 points) and first-year Knick Karl-Anthony Towns (30) paced New York in Sunday's 132-121 defeat to Indiana, as the team was doomed by its own 7-of-25 shooting from 3-point range, combined with a 21-of-46 effort from long range by the Pacers. ""We gave up way too much,"" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""(We) didn't cover the (3-point) line. We gotta fix it, and we gotta fix it fast. ... We have to be strong on both sides of the ball. If we're just gonna rely on offense, we're not gonna be a good team."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But Eberflus maintained on Monday that moving rookie No. 1 pick Caleb Williams out of the starting lineup is not one of the many changes he's considering as the Bears shift their attention to the Green Bay Packers.  ""Caleb is our starter,"" Eberflus said, but declared an evaluation of the process of almost everything the team does offensively would be evaluated on Monday. ""There's got to be a change and adjustment,"" Eberflus said. ""There's also the sight that we're 4-5, we haven't played our division yet. ... We're in the process of getting (that evaluation) done. There will be changes and adjustments being made.""  Williams and the Bears were dominated by the New England Patriots (3-7) on Sunday, Chicago's third consecutive loss, and head into Week 11 with a run of 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown. The Bears scored three points against the Patriots, one week after putting up nine points at Arizona, and were held under 17 points for the fifth time this season. New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Offensive coordinator Shane Waldron received a vote of confidence coming out of the loss to Arizona. But Eberflus didn't guarantee Waldron would be calling plays when the Bears host the Packers (6-3) this Sunday. ""The process of that, we're going through that right now. All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.  ""It's important that we're using all the people in the building on the coaching staff, getting all the input, putting our minds together to come up with the best answer,"" Eberflus said. ""That's where we are right now. We've got to look at that this afternoon as well."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

When the teams meet Tuesday night in Orlando for their NBA Cup group-play opener, the Magic will try to improve to 5-0 at home. They are coming off a huge second half that helped them crush the Washington Wizards 121-94 on Sunday by scoring 60 points after halftime.   Forward Franz Wagner scored 23 points as the Magic recorded a season-high point total. Wagner has led Orlando in scoring for the past five games.   The Magic now have a season-best three-game winning streak in their sights. They are still adjusting to the absences of injured Paolo Banchero (oblique) and Wendell Carter Jr. (foot), with the responsibility to make up for that production spread around the team.   ""I'm just going to keep trying to put these performances together, keep running my way back into the lineup and just do what I can do,"" said Magic guard Cole Anthony, who scored 16 points off the bench against Washington.   The Hornets fell 107-105 in overtime Sunday against the host Philadelphia 76ers after rallying from 16 points down with 9:44 remaining in regulation.   ""We'll grow from this and learn from it,"" Charlotte coach Charles Lee said.   Guard LaMelo Ball racked up 38 points and eight assists for Charlotte, which is 1-3 in road games. Ball hit a game-tying 3-pointer from the left corner as he was fading out of bounds to force overtime.   ""I expect it every game, so it's not anything surprising,"" teammate Brandon Miller said of Ball. ""That's what he does -- play at a high clip in this league, and he's going to keep getting better every day.""   Ball has scored more than 30 points in four of the last six games.   Anthony has averaged just 12.1 minutes per game to start the season but he is still playing with an edge, something that was evident after he drained a 3-pointer in Sunday's game.   ""He made the 3 on the right wing and came back and stared at me the whole time like he had just made six in a row,"" Orlando coach Jamahl Mosley said. ""But that's who he is ... that fearless, confident leader on the floor when he's out there.""   Anthony is looking to bounce back from a ragged start to the season, averaging 4.8 points per game and shooting 26.3 percent from 3-point range.

I'm just going to keep trying to put these performances together.""   The Hornets have been dinged with injuries at the post positions, which makes their 50-40 rebounding edge against the 76ers encouraging.   In the Hornets' backcourt, Tre Mann has been dealing with back soreness to put his availability in question. He has been a spark off the bench.

The storied programs will meet for the first time since the 2021 edition of the event, when the Blue Devils topped the Wildcats 79-71 in New York. Tuesday's matchup will look a lot different from the sidelines, as that was the final meeting between legendary coaches Mike Krzyzewski and John Calipari. Krzyzewski retired as Duke's head coach after that 2021-22 season, and Calipari bolted for Arkansas in April. They were replaced by Jon Scheyer and Mark Pope, respectively. Scheyer, in his third year at his alma mater, has the Blue Devils 2-0 after blowing past a pair of outmatched opponents. Behind freshman phenom Cooper Flagg and fellow first-year player Kon Knueppel, Duke topped Maine 96-62 and Army 100-58. When Flagg committed to Duke in October 2023, the 6-foot-9 Maine native became 247 Sports' second all-time perfect-rated recruit to commit to the Blue Devils, joining RJ Barrett. Through two games, the projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft is averaging 15.5 points and 9.0 rebounds per game. Knueppel leads Duke with 18.5 points per game. Despite Duke's leaders being just a year removed from high school, Scheyer doesn't think his team lacks any poise. ""It's been that way from Day 1, since we recruited these guys,"" Scheyer said of Duke's maturity. ""I think all of that is contagious. ... I think our freshmen are mature beyond their years. They're about the right things. They're about being coached, and I'm lucky to coach these guys. They want to be here, and I think that needs to show even more as we face adversity this season."" Duke's youngsters will face their first big test on Tuesday against the new-look Wildcats. Kentucky didn't return a single contributor from last season, filling out its roster with a flurry of transfer additions. So far, it's been the signings of Dayton transfer Koby Brea and former Oklahoma guard Otega Oweh that have led the 2-0 Wildcats. Brea, who shot 49.8 percent on 3-pointers for the Flyers last year, paces the team with 19.0 points per game, followed by Oweh's 15.5. In a 100-72 rout of Bucknell on Saturday, Brea led the Wildcats with 20 points on six 3-pointers off the bench. ""I'm really proud of Koby,"" Pope said. ""Like all of our guys, he's trying to figure out his space and how he fits, and if it's really going to work or not. He's boldly committed to loving this game as much as he can. ... He's been really special."" Drexel transfer Amari Williams has added 12.5 points and 13.5 rebounds per game, while Wake Forest transfer Andrew Carr has chipped in 11.0 points. Kentucky leads the all-time series 12-11 but has lost three of four against the Blue Devils in the Champions Classic. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Kyle Neptune and the visiting Wildcats aim to focus on archrival Saint Joseph's when the teams meet Tuesday in Philadelphia. Since taking over for two-time national champion coach Jay Wright, Neptune has missed the NCAA Tournament in each of his first two seasons at Villanova. The Wildcats (2-1) then absorbed a 10-point home loss to Columbia last week before recovering with a crisp 91-54 victory over NJIT on Friday. Still, Neptune knows there will be plenty of eyes on Villanova's progress as he navigates Year 3 of his tenure. ""For sure, we haven't performed to the standard of where Villanova basketball has been,"" Neptune said. ""If that's the truth, OK. The only thing I can do is worry about what myself and our staff can control, and that's trying to prepare this team to be the best it can be by the end of the season, and doing that with joy and doing that with a positive attitude."" Eric Dixon registered 22 points and 10 rebounds in the win over NJIT and is averaging 27.5 points and eight boards in his two games this season. He'll certainly be a focus of the defensive game plan for the Hawks, who are looking to rebound from a 73-67 loss to Central Connecticut State. Rasheer Fleming led Saint Joseph's with 19 points and 16 rebounds. ""We're not there yet,"" said Saint Joseph's coach Billy Lange, who added that his team is ""still working through voice commands"" on the defensive end. The series between Villanova and Saint Joe's, known as the ""Holy War,"" dates back to 1921. The Wildcats had won 11 matchups in a row before losing 78-65 last November. This game is part of the Big 5 Classic series, in which the six Division I programs in the Philadelphia area compete for the city crown. The victory over Villanova last season helped Saint Joe's win under the new Big 5 format, which also includes Temple, La Salle, Drexel and Penn. Drexel was added to the series last season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Caufield helped put an end to the Canadiens' six-game losing skid as he struck on the power play with 7:02 left in the third period to record his second goal of the contest and the eventual game-winner. Sabres star Tage Thompson scored his team-leading 11th goal of the season, but left the game early in the second period with a lower-body injury. Sam Montembeault turned aside all four shots he faced in relief of Cayden Primeau, while Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen made 14 saves on 18 shots before being pulled. Suzuki finished with two goals and one assist, while Juraj Slafkovsky tallied three assists. Josh Anderson got the Canadiens on the board less than five minutes into the contest. But just 24 seconds later, the red-hot Thompson tied it up, extending his goal-scoring streak to four games. Caufield first struck on the power play, as with 14:34 to go in the second period the sniper redirected Lane Hutson's no-look pass from the point into the net. Once again, the Sabres refused to go away as Dylan Cozens and Peyton Krebs each found the back of the net just 59 seconds apart to retake the lead for Buffalo. Suzuki and Slafkovsky then hooked up for a pair of goals in the final minute of the second period to give the Canadiens their first lead of the game. Luukkonen was replaced by Devon Levi after the second period. Rasmus Dahlin tied the game 4-4 on the power play about two minutes into the third period, and JJ Peterka retook the lead for the Sabres less than two minutes after Dahlin's goal. Primeau was replaced by Montembeault following Peterka's goal. Emil Heineman wired home the game's fifth tying goal with 9:10 left in the third period. After Caufield's go-ahead tally, Christian Dvorak sealed the win with an empty-net goal in the last minute. Buffalo also lost defenseman Mattias Samuelsson to a lower-body injury in the second period. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The No. 25 Rebels (2-0) had a surprisingly difficult time in their second game, rallying to edge visiting Grambling State 66-64 last Friday. They will try to continue building toward conference play when they meet South Alabama (1-1) in another nonconference game Tuesday night in Oxford, Miss. Ole Miss coach Chris Beard acknowledged that his team didn't play its best last time out, but he pointed out that the Tigers had seven returning starters from last year's team, which won the SWAC regular-season and tournament titles and won a game in the NCAA Tournament before losing to eventual national runner-up Purdue. So the close call maybe should not have been all that surprising, and the bottom line was the final score. ""I'm not pleased with the way we played for 40 minutes, but I am pleased that we won the game,"" Beard said. ""We have lots to learn from. We've got to play better, obviously."" The Rebels struggled with their 3-point shooting, making just 6 of 26, though Beard is unconcerned about that aspect of their game overall. ""We're going to be a good 3-point shooting team. It's who we are,"" Beard said. ""This game the three wasn't our friend. Some of that was self-inflicted with our shot selection, but there were a lot of threes that we're going to take all day every day."" Ole Miss was able to overcome the poor 3-point shooting in part because of a disparity in turnovers. The Rebels scored 26 points off 22 Grambling turnovers and they committed just six turnovers themselves, leading to 11 Grambling points. Another area that Ole Miss plans to work on before it faces South Alabama is its rebounding. The Tigers outrebounded the Rebels 39-33, leading to an 11-4 advantage in second-chance points. ""(Rebounding) will continue to be a focus,"" Beard said. ""That's something we've got to get cleaned up."" In the end Ole Miss was able to overcome a 12-point second-half deficit thanks to a 20-0 run, though the game still went to the wire. Dre Davis led four players in double figures with 13 points; Jaylen Murray paces the Rebels with a 17.0 scoring average thus far. South Alabama evened its record with a 70-64 road victory against Nicholls State last Friday. It trailed by four points before finishing with a 15-5 run in the final five minutes. The Jaguars are hoping to build on that victory, because a point of emphasis for seventh-year head coach Richie Riley is for his team to hit its stride earlier than it has in recent seasons. Last season the Jaguars won six of their last eight Sun Belt Conference regular-season games and finished 16-16 overall. Two years ago, they won 11 of their final 14 games to finish 19-16. ""I do feel like this team is operating at a much higher urgency level than we've operated at in a long time,"" Riley said. ""We want to get off to a better start. The calling card of our team is we get better as the year goes on. We need to play better early."" Myles Corey has averaged 19.0 points and 9.5 assists through two games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Broncos kicker Wil Lutz lined up for a 35-yard field-goal attempt Sunday as time was set to expire, but the attempt was blocked by the Chiefs' Leo Chenal, who charged right through the middle of the Denver line. The undefeated Chiefs escaped with a 16-14 victory, leaving the Broncos at a crossroad with a 5-5 record. ""They exploited an area that we obviously felt was fixed and stronger, but not fixed enough,"" Payton said Monday. ""I read all the comments afterwards, and I think that it's tough to lose a game that way. This isn't on the player. This is on all of us. This is on us as coaches. ""We've got to continue to look at, ‘Hey, are we big enough stature-wise there for that?' And understanding how the rush was coming. It's disappointing."" Payton clarified the area that was exploited. ""They felt like they had an indication relative to how (center Alex Forsyth's) weight was balanced,"" Payton said. ""All of that is game planning, scouting and then it's us coaching and looking at the self-scout. Again, it's nothing new."" The Broncos are merely third in the AFC West, but with the conference's muddled postseason picture, Denver is currently in possession of the seventh and final playoff spot. The Broncos are listed with a 51 percent playoff probability. And while Sunday ended in a heartbreaking defeat, the Broncos can also look at it as a near miss, on the road against an undefeated team that also won the last two Super Bowls. ""The sky is not falling,"" Payton said. ""There's a lot ahead obviously."" Of the seven games still on the schedule, the Broncos face four teams currently out of the AFC's playoff picture. But they have still have to face the 6-4 Atlanta Falcons on Sunday and finish the regular season with a rematch against the Chiefs. The advantage for Denver is that both of those games are at home. ""I like the leadership on this team. It's an entirely different team than a year ago,"" Payton said. ""It's (a) tough (team) mentally and physically. ... Listen, when you talk to the players about that (loss), you tell them, ‘Hey, that's going to happen periodically in your career.' ""You hope that you have a few of those games that maybe you thought that you didn't deserve to win that you did win. You have to bounce back either way."" That optimism is further fueled by the play of rookie quarterback Bo Nix, who has completed 63.6 percent of his passes for 1,968 yards and 10 touchdowns with six interceptions. He also has 290 yards rushing with four more TDs. ""Offensively, we played that team better than we have in the past with what they do,"" Payton said. ""We had some scoring opportunities certainly at the end of the (first) half that we didn't take a good enough advantage of."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Howard returned home after a good workout with the Bengals and plans to continue training in hopes of another opportunity, per the report. Howard, 31, played in 100 games (99 starts) for the Miami Dolphins from 2016-23. The Dolphins released Howard on March 13 in a cost-cutting move, saving an estimated $18.5 million. The Bengals (4-6) are looking for help in the secondary as they try to make a playoff push. Howard tallied 29 interceptions (two returned for touchdowns), 95 passes defensed and 331 tackles with Miami. The Bengals also reportedly had veteran running back Leonard Fournette in for a workout, but they went on to sign running back Gary Brightwell to their practice squad, according to Brightwell's agent. The Bengals were eyeing Fournette for their practice squad, per reports. The team traded for Khalil Herbert last week after placing RB Zack Moss (neck) on injured reserve. Fournette, 29, appeared in two games last year with the Buffalo Bills, rushing for 40 yards on 12 carries. The former No. 4 overall pick in 2017 has rushed for 4,518 yards and 34 touchdowns in 81 games (61 starts) for the Jacksonville Jaguars (2017-19), Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2020-22) and Bills. Brightwell, 25, played in 37 games across the 2021-23 seasons for the New York Giants, getting 41 carries for 164 yards and a touchdown. He started this season with the Cleveland Browns but saw limited playing time in two appearances before he was released. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Sam Houston State (1-1) beat Tarleton 91-62 on Saturday behind 15 points apiece from Dorian Finister and Lamar Wilkerson. Kian Scroggins scored 14 points and had eight rebounds. The Bearkats won the Conference USA regular-season crown last year. Baylor (1-1) bounced back from its season-opening, 101-63 loss to No. 6 Gonzaga with a 72-67 win on Saturday against No. 16 Arkansas. Jayden Nunn scored 16 points and Norchad Omier had a double-double with 15 points and 12 rebounds. Baylor dropped four spots in Associated Press Top 25 poll released Monday. The Bears had five players score in double figures against Arkansas, which is the kind of balanced approach coach Scott Drew wants as Baylor newcomers get acquainted with the returnees. There are nine new players on the Bears' roster and Drew knows it'll take time before the team jells. Not only did Baylor open the season against a pair of ranked teams, the nonconference schedule still features St. John's, Tennessee or Virginia in the Bahamas and a trip to play UConn, the two-time defending national champions. ""Here's the thing with new players: They are out there learning what you want and how to run stuff,"" Drew said. ""They are out there thinking and if you are thinking you are not playing. Returning players already know what you want them to do, so they are able to play. That's why these guys will all play better, shoot it better and perform better as the season goes on."" While nothing seemed to go right against Gonzaga on Monday, by the time Saturday rolled around, the Bears executed a game plan that valued possessions and handled Arkansas' pressure defense. The game was tied twice, but Arkansas never held a lead. Drew credited the Bears with taking care of the basketball on offense. Baylor only had eight turnovers and were able to get more defensive stops, which allowed them to play in transition. ""We took care of the ball and shared it a lot more,"" Drew said. ""We took much better shots and defended a lot better. It was a typical Baylor game."" The Bearkats hope a rugged nonconference schedule prepares them for meaningful games in February and March. They were 21-12 overall last season and 13-3 in Conference USA play. As the No. 1 seed in the Conference USA tournament, they were eliminated with a semifinal loss to UTEP. It's the kind of success that made nonconference games hard to come by, with potential opponents reticent to face the Bearkats after they put themselves on the map last season. ""This is a really tough nonconference schedule,"" Sam Houston State coach Chris Mudge said. ""I thought last year was tough in the nonconference and then we anted up on this one. It's difficult to get games when you have a good year. People don't want to play you."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The game is an NBA Cup group-play opener for both teams. The Heat and Pistons are part of the tournament's East Group B, which also includes the Indiana Pacers, Milwaukee Bucks and Toronto Raptors. Nikola Jovic's three-point play with 7.8 seconds left proved to be the difference in a 95-94 triumph over the Timberwolves. Miami lost to Sacramento, Phoenix and Denver prior to the one-point thriller. The Heat trailed 88-80 with less than five minutes remaining. ""That was a signature win for us,"" Heat center Bam Adebayo said. After a timeout, Duncan Robinson inbounded the ball to Jovic, who was moving off a back screen. ""It is extremely difficult to generate an open shot on a side out of bounds, particularly against a team that is well coached, they have great length,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""So we were just fortunate. Duncan made a great pass, Niko made a great cut."" Tyler Herro has carried the offense lately, leading the team in scoring in the last four games by averaging 26.3 points. The biggest development Sunday was the defensive effort. Minnesota's point total was the lowest allowed by Miami this season. ""This is the hardest we've played in any of the regular-season games this season,"" Spoelstra said. ""It's the message we tell our team all the time, that does not guarantee you anything. It doesn't. But you put yourself out there as a competitor, you give yourself the best collective chance to win in a tough building. ""This is a tough team, an experienced team and it requires everybody on the roster playing as hard as they can, leaving it all out there and then you obviously have to make plays, which we did at the end."" Miami played without Jimmy Butler, who sprained his right ankle against the Nuggets. There is a good chance he will sit out Tuesday as well. The Pistons' last three games haven't been decided until the closing seconds. They lost to the Houston Rockets 101-99 on Sunday. Tobias Harris had a chance to tie the game on two free throws with one second remaining. He missed the first, forcing him to intentionally miss the second in a futile attempt for a tip-in off a rebound. ""Obviously that's tough, but we trust Tobias to knock his free throws down,"" Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""He just missed it."" Detroit saw Houston grab 17 offensive rebounds, including some key putbacks in the late going. ""I thought our guys did a great job in the scrap; there were times when they beat us to the ball, which is what they've done and what's helped them win basketball games,"" Bickerstaff said. ""I thought our guys fought the fight. We gave ourselves an opportunity, but (seven) offensive rebounds in the fourth quarter; it's just too tough to overcome."" Cade Cunningham's three-game triple-double streak ended, though he came close to extending it. He finished with 26 points, eight rebounds and nine assists. The Pistons got some good news on Monday. Second-year forward Ausar Thompson has been cleared to play after dealing with blood clot issues.

The Bulls outscored the Hawks 65-43 in the second half, and 35-15 in the fourth quarter. ""Early in the second half, they went straight to their bench,"" Atlanta guard Trae Young said. ""The guys they brought in were just running. They weren't even really running any plays, they were just running fast. It can definitely wear you down. Coach (Billy) Donovan is obviously a really good coach and he's been in this game for a while. He saw what was going on and they used that to their advantage. ""We all know when a team (plays back-to-back nights), you want to get up and down and make them tired. ... We've played three back-to-backs in the first two-and-a-half weeks. Nobody's gonna feel bad for us. We have to fight through it."" Atlanta's Clint Capela had 20 points with nine rebounds, while Jalen Johnson also had 20 points. The Hawks have lost seven of their last nine games after a 2-0 start. ""We gave too many fast-break points to them and they got confident,"" Capela said. ""Once a team gets confident like that it makes your job harder. ... I think we got a little static on offense not knowing what to do. There were a lot of guys going one-on-one without really creating something."" Boston overcame a 17-point first-half deficit to defeat the Milwaukee Bucks 113-107 on the road Sunday. Jayson Tatum had 31 points, 12 rebounds and six assists as the Celtics started the second half on a 12-0 run and held the Bucks to 38 points in the final two quarters. ""I think we just picked up the intensity,"" Boston's Jrue Holiday said. ""Knowing that they came out and hit shots (early), not getting too ahead of ourselves or two down on ourselves. Getting back to Celtics basketball."" Boston also received a 14-point performance from Jaylen Brown, who returned after missing four games with a hip flexor strain. He was 4 of 13 from the field in 37 minutes and had five rebounds and four assists. ""Felt better physically,"" Brown said. ""Not all the way there yet, but I was able to throw my weight around and explode a little bit better. So I felt better today, but it's a long journey, a long season. Taking care of your body is important. ""They shot the ball well and we still figured out a way to win, so I'm glad this was my return game."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The 2024 edition features the nation's top team, but its nothing new for the Jayhawks and Spartans to seek out early measuring sticks. Kansas (2-0) breezed past Howard 87-57 on Nov. 4 in its season opener before fending off No. 9 North Carolina 92-89 on Friday.

Kansas is 8-5 all-time in the Champions Classic, including 2-2 against the Spartans.  The teams most recently met in the event in 2021, with Kansas winning 87-74. Even though his team is favored in Tuesday's game, Self knows not to underestimate a Tom Izzo-coached team.

Although the Dolphins are 2-6 with three consecutive losses, Miami is far more competitive than the record indicates since starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa returned from a four-game hiatus on injured reserve with a concussion. Miami narrowly lost twice since Tagovailoa stepped back into the start job. The Dolphins dropped a one-point decision to Arizona and were also beaten by Buffalo by a field goal margin. As for the Rams (4-4), they'll look to keep their playoff hopes alive by extending their winning streak to four games and keeping their noses up with the rest of the pack in the NFC West. Given both teams' firepower on offense when healthy, this matchup looks tailor-made to produce a high-scoring affair.  --Dolphins' offense energized with Tagovailoa's return  The Dolphins scored 27 points in back-to-back games with Tagovailoa returning to rescue a group putting up less than two touchdowns per game without him. His presence alone tends to have a calming effect on the offense based on his accuracy and ability to put the ball exactly where he wants it to go. Tagovailoa completed 69.3 percent of his passes last season and is up to 72.7 percent this season. The Dolphins are more likely to remain on schedule with Tagovailoa, who has the fifth-highest success rate among quarterbacks with a minimum of 140 plays. When you're picking up the necessary yardage on early downs, you'll have more flexibility with your playcalling. In their last two games, the Dolphins converted 65.2 percent of their third-down opportunities and 6-for-8 in touchdown conversions inside the red zone. While the offense can sometimes resemble a slow grind, the Dolphins' efficiency under Tagovailoa makes them a real threat to opposing defenses. We're eyeing the over on Tagovailoa completions -- set at 21.5 at DraftKings, ESPN Bet and FanDuel -- given his high-percentage horizontal route connections with wide receivers Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle and the additional threat of running back De'Von Achane. Tagovailoa was 25 of 28 (89.3 percent) at Buffalo last week and 28 of 38 in his first game back from IR.  --Pass defense a mutual concern Los Angeles had its share of injury woes, with wide receivers Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua combining to miss seven games. Both players are now back with the team to significantly boost the Rams offense. The passing game is vital for the Rams because they struggle to run the ball, ranking 31st in yards per carry (3.8). As a result, it's no surprise that Los Angeles has the ninth-highest pass play rate at 58.68 percent. Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford should be eager for his chance to face this Dolphins defense. According to the FTN Fantasy Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA) metric, Miami ranks 27th against the pass. However, the Rams' pass defense is only one spot better.  Pro Football Focus offers a similar view. It has the Dolphins 26th in pass coverage while grading the Rams as the third worst in this category. Hence, we play the points. This total opened at 47.5 and was bet up as high as 49.5 before we began to see a little bit of buyback. It's now settling at 49 at most sportsbooks. As of Monday morning, 48.5 was still available at FanDuel. In a perfect scenario -- or close to perfect health for both teams -- this number would probably be closer to 52.  Do not pass: take the value and run with it.  Best bet: over 48.5 points (-115 at FanDuel) --Michael Nwaneri, Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Before Williams left for his Korean War assignment, he had dinner with legendary sportswriter Grantland Rice. According to the superb book “The Wingmen: The Unlikely, Unusual, Unbreakable Friendship Between John Glenn and Ted Williams” by Adam Lazarus, Williams understood the stakes. “Then he said—and this is what I can’t get out of my mind,” Rice told fellow New York sportswriter Frank Graham, “(he said) ‘I expect to be killed, of course.’” Berra and Williams are two of the many examples of remarkable athletes who didn’t limit their greatness to the playing field—and risked their lives to do it. Veterans Day represents a wonderful opportunity to relive their sacrifices for the United States of America. Ty Cobb, Warren Spahn, Bobby Jones, David Robinson, Hank Greenberg, Chuck Bednarik and Hoyt Wilhelm are among other athletes who saw active duty or worked as intelligence officers. Bob Feller, who was perhaps the greatest pitcher of his day, enlisted in the Naval Reserve two days after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. Serving as a gun captain on the USS Alabama, Feller earned eight battle stars and six campaign ribbons in North Atlantic and Pacific theaters. After missing nearly four full seasons of his prime, Feller was discharged on Aug. 22, 1945, and earned a complete-game win over the World Series-bound Detroit Tigers two days later. By no means are former Major League Baseball legends the only ones to come to their country’s aid. After four years as a safety for the Arizona Cardinals, Pat Tillman and his brother, Kevin (an Anaheim Angels pitcher), enlisted in the Army in May 2002 as their response to 9/11. They trained to join the Army Rangers, and their regiment was deployed to Iraq and then Afghanistan as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Tillman was killed April 22, 2004, in Afghanistan by friendly fire during a firefight. Forty years before, Roger Staubach enjoyed a wondrous athletic career at Navy. In addition to earning the 1963 Heisman Trophy and being featured on the cover of Time magazine (he was pushed off the cover of Life due to John F. Kennedy’s assassination), Staubach excelled for three years on the baseball team (batting .420 as a sophomore) and received two letters on the basketball team. Upon graduation in 1965, Staubach immediately began to serve his five-year commitment to the Navy, which included one year in Vietnam. He entered the NFL in 1969 as a 27-year-old rookie with the Dallas Cowboys, who had the foresight to spend their 10th-round pick in the 1964 NFL Draft on Staubach. Within three years, Staubach led the Cowboys to the Super Bowl championship. He was awarded the Super Bowl MVP award, which came with a Dodge Charger. Staubach traded it in for a station wagon—the better to transport his three young kids.  Staubach’s Cowboys and Rocky Bleier’s Pittsburgh Steelers met more than once in the Super Bowl—and Bleier’s military journey was more harrowing than Staubach’s. After playing his rookie year in Pittsburgh, Bleier was drafted into the Army. He went to Vietnam and suffered multiple injuries in August 1969. He was shot in the thigh during an ambush. Not long after during that firefight, he saw a grenade bounce off his commanding officer’s back. “It rolls toward me and I wasn’t but three feet from him as I was sitting there,” Bleier told the American Veterans Center. “I got up to jump and it blew up and I was standing on top of it… I had nerve damage coming up out of my (right) foot, broken bones under my foot. Fortunately I didn’t lose any part of my foot.” During his lengthy recovery that included several surgeries, Bleier was told he would not play football again. Instead, he played 10 more seasons with the Steelers and won four Super Bowls to go with his Purple Heart and Silver Star. “Because I became a story and because we were successful, it put Vietnam on the top of the list,” Bleier said. “So all those Vietnam veterans out there who were repressed, who didn’t get the credit or the pat on the back, all of a sudden, here was one of ours that made it. And got through and got recognition for his service, which the rest of us can ride on his coattails or whatever it might be. But it was well-deserved (recognition) that we all should have gotten at that time.”  Copyright 2024"
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Philadelphia 76ers Star Joel Embiid Is Incapable of Taking the High Road,https://deadspin.com/philadelphia-76ers-star-joel-embiid-is-incapable-of-taking-the-high-road/,2024-11-11T14:02:05.448Z,"After serving a suspension for shoving a reporter in the locker room, Joel Embiid is incapable of taking the high road as the Sixers look to make up g","Joel Embiid has played in just 433 regular-season games since being the No. 3 overall pick of the 2014 NBA Draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. He has never once played 70 games in a season. And when Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes criticized Embiid's work ethic, lack of conditioning and pattern of unavailability, it didn't go over well with the 2022-23 NBA MVP. Embiid hasn't played yet this season due to a left knee injury plus the three-game suspension he earned for shoving Hayes after a game on Nov. 2. Embiid was irritated with the reporter for a few reasons, one being that he mentioned the name of the center's dead brother and young son, both named Arthur, in the highly critical column. Embiid certainly has the right to be upset and to deliver sharp words at the reporter—dang, what was the over-under on profane words during the confrontation? No matter what the topic, the second an athlete gets physical with a reporter, they have lost the battle and the war. While announcing the suspension, high-ranking NBA executive Joe Dumars included this nugget in his statement: ""Interactions must remain professional on both sides and can never turn physical."" Keep your hands off, Joel. You're 30 years old. You've been frustrated with the things this whole season. Instead of pushing somebody, have the team set you up with counseling to help figure out why you have so much anger. Embiid, of course, is a spectacular player who has career averages of 27.9 points and 11.2 rebounds. He led the NBA in scoring back-to-back seasons and had a solid chance to do so again last season before injuring the left knee in late January. He underwent surgery on Feb. 6 and later returned to action, but he hobbled through the playoffs. The knee certainly didn't recover because here he is still battling more issues with it. The 76ers need the seven-time All-Star on the floor to make a run at a title. But even with Embiid, Philadelphia hasn't reached the Eastern Conference finals during his career, let alone the NBA Finals. The more the 76ers come up short, the more people question whether Embiid will ever get Philadelphia to the finals. The 76ers last title came in 1983, when NBA MVP Moses Malone and basketball icon Julius Erving led the way. The 76ers added Paul George in the offseason to help with the title quest, and Tyrese Maxey, who just injured a hamstring, is also part of a star-studded trio. But no matter who you break it down, the 76ers need Embiid on the floor. They are a dreadful 2-7, and five of the losses have been by double digits. Embiid is eligible to return from his suspension on Tuesday against the New York Knicks. Those are the same Knicks that eliminated Philadelphia in the first round of last season's playoffs. There's no guarantee Embiid's knee will be ready for the contest against the Knicks. And that's kind of the real problem—when will that knee allow him to take the court and be a dominant force? Because once he's playing games and putting up 30-plus points every night, this whole situation will disappear. The focus will return to his skills, and the 76ers should start winning more games. But exploding on a reporter—even if the Arthur stuff was unnecessary—is not a good look for the so-called face of the franchise. Embiid has seemed to be one of those players that could spend his entire career with one organization. If that doesn't happen, consider the recent weeks as the beginning of the road out of town. Embiid made a big mistake. He'll choose his path moving forward. But big Joel, maybe keep your hands off the working stiffs in the future. Copyright 2024"

Houston was up 23-7 at intermission. Detroit quarterback Jared Goff had already been picked off three times, Texans counterpart C.J. Stroud had completed 70 percent of his passes, and the Lions had never faced such a deficit this season. What could go wrong? A lot, apparently. Detroit stormed all the way back, keeping Houston off the scoreboard in the second half and winning 26-23 on Jake Bates’ 52-yard field goal as time expired. So, make that three losses in four games for the once-mighty Texans, who were 5-1 through their first six games of the season. Injuries have been the main reason for Houston’s steady decline, with a bum hamstring forcing Nico Collins to miss the past five games and fellow wide receiver Stefon Diggs done for the year because of a torn ACL. If the Texans were in any other division than the AFC South, which currently features three teams that a handful of high school JV squads could probably give a run for their money, they would really be in a tight spot. But luckily for Houston, it still has some room for error. However, each setback gives the Indianapolis Colts a reason to keep chasing that division crown. Indianapolis (4-6) is the only team that the 6-4 Texans have to keep their eye on in the AFC South, as the Tennessee Titans (2-7) and Jacksonville Jaguars (2-8) might as well start scheduling offseason vacation plans. There’s a very real possibility that the Colts go 6-1 to close out the campaign. Yes, an optimistic prediction for sure, but colliding with the New York Jets, New England Patriots, New York Giants, Titans and Jaguars could result in a lot of late-season success.  Win those games, then beat either the Broncos or Lions, and congrats, Indianapolis. A 6-1 finish for a 10-7 record. Down Denver and Detroit, and now you’ve shattered all expectations.  Of course, this Colts team has plenty of problems of its own and hasn’t really been able to click all season despite having some serious talent, especially on the offensive side of the ball. Still, Indianapolis can say it has life, which a number of teams would kill for heading into Week 11. After a loss like the one it had on Sunday, Houston could easily go off the rails. It has great opportunities to bounce back ahead of its Week 14 bye -- facing the Dallas Cowboys, Titans and Jaguars -- but dropping any of those games really creates some cause for concern. Following their brief hiatus, the Texans will be greeted by a healthy version of the Miami Dolphins before taking on the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens. Then it’s down to Nashville for the regular-season finale against the Titans. Houston was already on a very slippery slope, and handing off a win to Detroit on Sunday certainly didn’t help it find its footing. The Texans shouldn’t be all that worried just yet, but if they do end up slipping in the standings, what happened in Week 10 won’t soon be forgotten. Copyright 2024"
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",It’s Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson Fight Week and I’m Embarrassingly Excited About It,https://deadspin.com/its-jake-paul-vs-mike-tyson-fight-week-and-im-embarrassingly-excited-about-it/,2024-11-11T13:48:13.575Z,"Jake Paul fights Mike Tyson on Friday November 15th on Netflix, and this fight is highly anticipated because of the unique nature of the matchup.","Top influencer boxer Jake Paul fights the legendary Mike Tyson on Friday, and I am embarrassed to admit just how excited I am for this.  The fight was originally scheduled for July 20, but had to be postponed after a medical scare for Tyson on an airplane, which was later diagnosed as an ulcer flare-up. Between these two dates, Paul hosted a surprisingly exciting fight against former UFC fighter Mike Perry, who had gained a little bit of fame for his success in the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship. Paul was named victorious by way of a technical knockout in the sixth round, as a swollen and beaten Perry just couldn’t proceed. Paul vs. Tyson comes with a fair amount of warranted criticism. Tyson is 58 years old. His last competitive fight was in 2005. In a 2020 exhibition against Roy Jones Jr. that ended in a draw, Tyson looked slow and like an older man that did not take the fight seriously. His fight against Paul will take place without headgear.  This fight with Paul will be different from your normal celebrity face-off, as it’s an actual sanctioned fight that will count on professional records.  This doesn’t feel like Logan Paul vs. Floyd Mayweather, which was a clear money grab. Don’t get me wrong, this is a massive money grab as well. It’ll be a huge spectacle at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys. While 80,000 can fit inside of that building, millions will watch this freak show live on Netflix. It’s another live event for Netflix, who impressed during their Labor Day broadcast of Joey Chestnut vs. Takeru Kobayashi. It’ll be interesting to see what Netflix can do with a combat sports broadcast. Another reason to be excited. But everyone will be interested in seeing what happens in the ring. Now 27 years old, Paul has taken the world of combat sports by storm. He’s knocked out former UFC stars like Tyron Woodley and Ben Askren. He’s battled older legends like Anderson Silva before. Prior to announcing his fight with Iron Mike, he was beating up some lesser-known boxers with relative ease. Tyson is a +200 underdog in this fight on most major sportsbooks, and that’s likely because of the 30-year age difference. But Tyson is different. He’s a heavyweight. This will be Paul’s first heavyweight bout, a division in which Tyson won six championship titles during his professional career. While training videos can easily be altered and edited, Tyson looks to be in great shape. At a heavier weight, Paul will presumably get tired quicker, and he’s never exactly been known for great endurance. Friday’s arrival will be met with excitement. A large piece of me feels like this could unfold like any other Paul fight, and that could be very apparent early in the match. The way Paul fights typically goes, he will strategically select an older, slower opponent that he could wear down with his heavy right hand. The opponents are typically in it for the pay day, and sometimes that’s very obvious with their clear lack of preparation. But there’s a small piece of me that thinks this one could be different. Surely, Tyson is in this one for the pay day, too. The legend has nothing left to prove inside of that ring. But if he could be the one to finally knock out Paul and put an end to all of this madness? That would be a story that only Netflix could script.  Copyright 2024"

The Thunder said Holmgren is expected to return this season after he endured a right iliac wing fracture. The 7-foot-1 star was injured during a fall after contesting a layup by Andrew Wiggins in the first quarter.  Holmgren, 22, is averaging 16.4 points, 8.7 rebounds and 2.6 blocks in 10 games this season.  The injury is the second significant one in the young career of Holmgren, who was selected by Oklahoma City with the second overall pick of the 2022 NBA Draft.

Holmgren debuted last season and was runner-up for NBA Rookie of the Year after averaging 16.5 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocked shots in 82 starts.

The Oklahoma City Thunder will have to adjust to being without one of theirs for the time being. On Monday night, the teams will square off in Oklahoma City with the Clippers still without Kawhi Leonard and the Thunder without Chet Holmgren. Leonard has yet to play this season due to inflammation in his right knee. He won't travel with the Clippers during a three-game trip that begins with Monday's contest. The game will be the second of four meetings between the teams this season. Oklahoma City won the first meeting, 105-92, in Los Angeles on Nov. 2. Holmgren played a significant role in that game with 10 points and 14 rebounds. Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said after that game that Holmgren's abilities made the Thunder particularly difficult to defend. But now, Oklahoma City will be without Holmgren for at least eight to 10 weeks after he sustained a pelvic fracture during the first quarter of Sunday's contest against the Golden State Warriors. Holmgren fell hard on his right hip after trying to defend a layup near the rim. The team announced the injury as a right iliac wing fracture and said he is expected to return this season.  Holmgren is averaging 16.4 points, 8.7 rebounds and 2.6 blocks a game this season. Oklahoma City trailed Sunday's game by 30 late in the third quarter before pulling as close as six late before the Warriors won 127-116. ""This is a resilient, tough, competitive, adaptive team,"" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said, ""and that's what we're going to be, regardless of the circumstances."" The Thunder might have to be even more adaptive. Before Holmgren's injury, Oklahoma City already was thin in the frontcourt with Isaiah Hartenstein, Jaylin Williams and Kenrich Williams all injured. Those three have not appeared in a game this season. ""It's kind of a next-man-up thing,"" Oklahoma City's Jalen Williams said. ""Can't dwell too long."" The Thunder's defense, which ranks best in the league with 100.3 points allowed per 100 possessions, figures to be most affected without Holmgren. ""All of us have to figure out how to get stops and rebound,"" Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. The Clippers' defense also is in the top five in the league, allowing 107.7 points per 100 possessions. After dropping their first matchup with the Thunder, the Clippers fell to 2-4 for the season. But Los Angeles has won four consecutive games since then, including Saturday's 105-103 home victory over Toronto. During the four-game winning streak, Clippers center Ivica Zubac is averaging 14.8 points and 12.3 rebounds. ""Zu's been great,"" Lue said. ""The big man that we've been playing a lot of minutes, but he's one of the most durable big men in the league, probably the most durable big man in the league."" Zubac has played in at least 68 games in each of the last four seasons. The Clippers have lost six consecutive games in Oklahoma City. They haven't won there since March 3, 2020. The Thunder are 2-0 on the second game of a back-to-back this season.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Spurs will play the third contest of a five-game homestand that's seen them split the first two games, defeating the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday and then dropping a 111-110 decision to the Utah Jazz on Saturday.  San Antonio on Saturday received 24 points and 16 rebounds from Victor Wembanyama, who was also called for a crucial offensive foul on a pick late in the game.  Stephon Castle had career-high 23 points in his third start, Devin Vassell scored 21, Keldon Johnson hit for 14 and Harrison Barnes tallied 10 points in the loss.  ""My guys have been in the gym with me,"" Castle said of his best-ever output. ""We're all confident in each other to shoot the ball no matter who it is. If we get open when we're told, we've got to shoot it. (It's about) just stepping up and shooting with confidence.""  Vassell's production came in his first action of the season after he missed more than seven months with a broken foot.  ""I haven't played in a long time,"" Vassell said afterward. ""You know, during the off season, I was kind of frustrated because at the end of the day, I just want to be out there on my teammates and play with them. I was able to get through it. They helped me get back in shape and everything.""  The Spurs have spilt their past four games and will get their first look this season at the Kings, who arrived in the Alamo City early Monday morning after a 127-118 overtime win in Phoenix on Sunday.  DeMar DeRozan led the Kings with 34 points while three other starters -- De'Aaron Fox (21 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists), Domantas Sabonis (20 points, 12 rebounds) and Keegan Murray (14 points, 14 rebounds) -- racked up double doubles in the victory. Kevin Huerter added 17 points for Sacramento.  The Kings have won three of their past four games.  While DeRozan is the most oft-mentioned new player for the Kings, Huerter -- who came to the team from Atlanta in July 2022 -- also has been a key cog. The 6-foot-7 guard underwent a 6 1/2-month recovery after season-ending surgery last April to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder.  ""I'm still getting myself in the swing of things, still trying to find my rhythm,"" said Huerter, who is averaging 11.3 points a game this season. ""A couple of new guys on our team and a new offense, so I'm trying to fully immerse myself with the team and kind of get my feet under me a little bit. It's been a rigorous summer, and obviously glad to be back in the swing."" Sacramento's super sixth man, Malik Monk, left Sunday's game early in the second quarter when he twisted his ankle after stepping on the foot step of Suns center Mason Plumlee. Monk did not return to the game, and his status for Monday's contest will be in question until game time. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Rockets eked out a 101-99 victory over the Pistons for their third win in the last four games. Houston, which will host the Washington Wizards on Monday night, beat Detroit while shooting just 40.9 percent from the field and missing 27 of 34 attempts from 3-point range. What the Rockets did well on Sunday was lean into their early-season profile by securing 17 offensive rebounds while recording a modest 11 turnovers. According to NBA.com, the Rockets exited the win over Detroit second in the league in offensive rebounding rate (35.9 percent) and fifth in turnover rate (12.5 percent). Their effectiveness in those two categories has offset woeful shooting, with only Portland and Utah posting effective field-goal percentages worse than the Rockets' 49.6 percent. Rebounding saved the Rockets against the Pistons. Alperen Sengun grabbed 10 rebounds while Tari Eason secured nine in 27 minutes off the bench. Starters Fred VanVleet and forward Jabari Smith Jr. shot a combined 5 for 21, including 1 for 11 on 3-pointers, but totaled 14 rebounds. The Rockets employ the offensive talent to turn things around on that end of the court, but their offensive rebounding and ball security should continue to serve as assets. ""That was a point of emphasis all year,"" Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. ""We got nine more shots because of that and took care of the ball. As I always say, you can rely on your defense when the shots aren't falling, so on the nights when they both click, you have a comfortable win. The nights where they're not, you can still dig it out and figure out a way to get it done."" The Wizards surrendered a pair of 30-point quarters in the second half of their 121-94 road loss to the Orlando Magic on Sunday, their fourth consecutive defeat, with three of those losses coming by at least 20 points. Washington again was without its second-leading scorer and rebounder, Kyle Kuzma (17 points, 7.7 rebounds), and his absence continues to be felt. Washington posted a minus-seven rebounding margin and allowed 15 offensive boards that Orlando converted into 22 points. The Wizards' ineffective performance on the glass was a shared responsibility, but 7-foot rookie Alex Sarr corraling only three rebounds in 24 minutes proved noteworthy. Sarr blocked two shots on Sunday after entering play averaging 2.6 per game, which ranked fourth in the NBA. If Sarr is to excel as a rim-protector, he'll need his teammates to cover for him on the glass when he rotates out of position and fills the role as a help defender. ""I think Alex is growing and learning every game,"" Wizards coach Brian Keefe said. ""We're seeing things that he's never seen before. ""I thought Alex came out and established a good presence at the rim early. We've got to keep helping him when he goes to shot-block and help him on the boards.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Samuel Ersson missed the first two games of the road trip with a lower-body injury before returning to make 28 saves against the Panthers.

Obviously we want more points, but if we play like this, they're going to come.""  Joel Farabee, Anthony Richard and Garnet Hathaway each scored a goal and Scott Laughton had two assists against Florida. Owen Tippett had the team's lone tally in five shootout attempts.  ""I thought we dictated the speed of the game tonight,"" Hathaway said. ""And that's something that when we're playing to our identity, that's what we do."" The Sharks are playing better in recent weeks, as well, having gone 5-2-0 in their last seven games following an 0-7-2 start to the season. Most recently, they slipped past the New Jersey Devils on Sunday night, 1-0, in the opener of a four-game trip. Mackenzie Blackwood made 44 saves for his 11th career shutout, blanking his former team in his first game as a visiting goaltender at Prudential Center. ""It's just one of those nights where it feels easy,"" Blackwood said. ""I don't know why sometimes that happens and sometimes it doesn't, but sometimes pucks just seem like they're coming in slow. I don't know why, but definitely you could say today was one of those days I was seeing the puck well."" While most teams typically don't start the same goalie on both ends of a back-to-back set, perhaps San Jose coach Ryan Warsofsky has a tougher decision to make after Blackwood's stellar effort on Sunday. ""(Blackwood) was outstanding, probably the best I've seen him play,"" Warsofsky said. ""You could just tell he was dialed in, focused and tracking pucks really well."" Of course, some credit must go to the Sharks' defense for shutting out a talented Devils team that entered with five wins in its previous six games. ""I thought we did a great job for the most part, staying tight,"" said Nico Sturm, who scored the lone goal for San Jose. ""Obviously, (Blackwood) had a huge game."" It remains to be seen if the Sharks' defense will have to contend with dynamic Flyers rookie Matvei Michkov, who has been a healthy scratch in the last two games. ""It's just part of the process,"" Tortorella said. ""With young guys, they can watch games too as far as developing. It's (about) trying to help him.""

As part of the series, the Nets will take on the alternate identity of “Les Nets” during their six Quebec-based games. The team’s temporary red-and-blue logo features two fleur-de-lis on a blue circle, a nod to the Quebec flag. A large red circle within the blue includes Montreal’s Mount Royal cross, stylized to represent a basketball while incorporating the city name. The incorporation of red isn’t because the Long Island Nets typically use red (I mean, of course, it is); it’s a tribute to Montreal’s McGill University, where James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, taught in the 1880s. “Montreal has a vibrant basketball legacy, and this partnership presents a unique opportunity to blend our culture with the Laval community,” said Morgan Taylor, Head of Business Operations for the Long Island Nets, in the press release. “We look forward to engaging with a new fanbase and creating memorable moments both on and off the court.” The arrangement brings up memories of the unique situation Minor League Baseball’s Buffalo Bisons found themselves in during the 2021 season. With their MLB affiliate from Toronto residing in their home stadium due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Bisons shifted their home games to Trenton, NJ. They played with a split identity, using their usual Bisons name and uniforms on the road but taking on that of the Trenton Thunder at home. The six-game series kicks off with back-to-back matchups against Raptors 905, the Toronto Raptors G-League affiliate, on January 24 and 26.

FC Barcelona announced the new “multi-year partnership agreement” on their website on Saturday, November 9. The club said the deal “brings a new collaborative strategic partnership model between the two organizations.” This new partnership consolidates Nike as a Main Partner of the Club and Official Technical Partner across all professional and amateur teams, bringing a unique model that strengthens the brands association and fuels the global retail and licensing business growth. Nike has a key strategic role in the Club’s Retail Operations and together with Barça Licensing & Merchandising will join forces in the development of specific plans related to product creation, supply chain and global distribution.   Nike has outfitted Barça since 1998. Since then, Barça’s men’s first team has won four Champions League titles, 12 La Liga titles, seven Copas del Rey, three World Club Cups and three European Super Cups wearing Nike uniforms, while the women’s first team has won nine league titles, three UEFA Women’s Champions League titles and nine Copas de la Reina in that time. The terms of the deal between Barça and Nike were not disclosed in Saturday’s announcement, but ESPN reports “the deal will total significantly more than €100 million ($107m) per year, but that the agreement is incremental and that the total amount is also dependent on certain add-ons.” They also report that Barça president Joan Laporte has previously claimed it would be the biggest deal of its kind in world soccer. According to Mundo Deportivo, Barça will receive €1.7 billion over 14 years, or about €121 million per year. It also includes a signing bonus of €158 million, which will also be spread over the 14 years of the contract. Mundo Deportivo also reports that Barça was allowed to field offers from other companies, and they did receive a proposal from German sportswear brand Puma, which Nike then matched. The previous contract between Nike and Barça was set to expire in 2024. There was some friction between the two sides earlier this year, with Footy Headlines reporting in July that a Spanish court had blocked Barça’s attempted to end their contract early. They also reported that retailers were having a hard time ordering Barcelona products from Nike, and Barça’s 2024-25 third kit celebrating women’s sport was released about three weeks later than similar third kits for other high-profile clubs outfitted by Nike."

The Smokies, who play in the Southern League, announced this week that with their return to their once and future hometown, the team will change its geographic designation from Tennessee to Knoxville. With that announcement came an armful of updated logos—though their familiar bear character, originally created by Dan Simon of Studio Simon in 2015, remains largely unchanged. The new suite of logos, design in house, includes a series of type-based marks as well as an alternate mark featuring three stars from the Tennessee state flag. “With the upcoming move to Knoxville, it is imperative to embrace our new home, while maintaining the Smokies brand,” said Boyd Sports President Chris Allen, quoted on MiLB.com. “It is our desire that the new logo honors the city of Knoxville and the rich tradition of Smokies Baseball.” The franchise played in Knoxville from 1921 to 1999 under a handful of names, including the Pioneers (1921–1924), Sox (1972–1979), Blue Jays (1980–1992), and two stints as the Knoxville Smokies (1925–1967 and 1993–1999). After the 1999 season, the team moved 20 miles east to the town of Kodak, where they played from 2000 to 2024 as the Tennessee Smokies. The Smokies will play at a new ballpark, Covenant Health Ballpark, set to open in 2025."

The Rangers unveiled the jerseys on their website and social media accounts on Friday, November 8, making this the 19th straight season the team has produced a Remembrance Day jersey. This year’s edition commemorates the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Normandy — better known as D-Day — which took place on June 6, 1944. The base of the jersey is royal blue, with grey, red and white stripes around each sleeve and the waist. The front of the jersey features a shield “based on imagery of soldiers entering the battle on the beaches of Normandy,” according to the Rangers’ website. Above the blue soldier rushing off a landing craft is the inscription “1944-2024”, while three red maple leaves swirl around the soldier. The 1944 Battle of Normandy was one of the pivotal events of the Second World War and the scene of some of Canada’s greatest feats of arms. Canadian sailors, soldiers and airmen played a critical role in the Allied invasion of Normandy, also called Operation Overlord, beginning the bloody campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi occupation. Nearly 150,000 Allied troops landed or parachuted into the invasion area on D-Day, including 14,000 Canadians at Juno Beach. The Royal Canadian Navy contributed 124 vessels and 10,000 sailors and the Royal Canadian Air Force contributed 39 squadrons to the operation. Total Allied casualties on D-Day reached more than 10,000, including 1,096 Canadians, of whom 381 were killed in action. By the end of the Battle of Normandy, the Allies had suffered 209,000 casualties, including more than 18,700 Canadians. Over 5,000 Canadian soldiers died. A poppy sits on the left chest of the jersey as a symbol of remembrance honoring armed forces personnel who have died in conflict. The left shoulder has a “D-DAY 80” logo while the Rangers’ primary logo sits on the right shoulder. The jersey was pictured with blue pants, gloves and helmets in photos released with Friday’s announcement. The socks are also blue with the same striping as found on the sleeves. The Rangers will wear their Remembrance Day jerseys tonight (Friday, November 8) when they host the Soo Greyhounds at the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium. It’s their only home game this Remembrance Day weekend, as they visit the Owen Sound Attack on Saturday and the Oshawa Generals on Sunday. Rangers fans can purchase game-worn Remembrance Day jerseys through a silent auction that will run throughout Friday’s game. Five of the jerseys will also be available for auction online through DASH. Proceeds from both auctions will benefit the 78th Fraser Highlanders Fort Conestoga Garrison and the Kitchener-Waterloo Poppy Fund."

The Moose unveiled the jersey on their website and social media channels on Thursday, November 7, and they’ll wear them on the ice for the first time on Saturday, November 23, when they host the Chicago Wolves. The focal point of the jerseys is the team’s classic “Happy Moose” logo, which appears on the front of the jersey recolored in the team’s current color palette. The Moose used a green and purple version of this logo when they were members of the International Hockey League from 1996 to 2001, and then a green and black version from 2001, when they moved to the AHL, until 2005. In 2011, the Winnipeg Jets brought NHL hockey back to the city, meaning the Moose moved to St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, where they were renamed the St. John’s IceCaps. But in 2015, the team moved back to Winnipeg and the Moose name and logo were revived, but the logo was recolored to match the Jets’ palette. The base of the 25th season celebration jersey is bright blue, with a navy blue collar and shoulder yoke. Navy blue, silver and white stripes run around each sleeve and the waist. The front of the jersey also includes a “25 SEASONS” patch with a map of Manitoba on the left chest. The Jets’ logo appears on the left shoulder, while an “MM” monogram appears on the right shoulder. “EST. 1996” is printed inside the collar. The numbers on the sleeves and back match those found on the Moose’s regular jerseys, with moose antlers built into the numerals. Along with the jerseys, the Moose also launched a line of 25th season merchandise on their online shop Thursday. This line includes hoodies, sweatshirts, caps, pucks and pins. The Moose will wear the 25th season celebration jerseys four times during the 2024-25 AHL regular season. At each of these games, the first 1,000 fans will receive one of four collector pins featuring either one of the team’s primary logos from past 25 years or the team’s 25th season logo.

SportsLogos.Net News,PWHL Unveils Jerseys for All 6 Teams Ahead of 2024-25 Season Start,https://news.sportslogos.net/2024/11/07/pwhl-unveils-jerseys-for-all-6-teams-ahead-of-2024-25-season-start/hockey-2/,"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 15:42:29 +0000","After team names and logos were revealed in September, jerseys hit shelves with just over three weeks until the puck drops on the 2024-25 PWHL regular season","With a little more than three weeks until the start of their 2024-25 regular season, the Professional Women’s Hockey League has finally given fans and players a look at what they’ll be wearing on the ice and in the stands. The PWHL launched new jersey designs for all six of its clubs on Thursday, November 7, all manufactured by Bauer. The league’s press release from the league focused heavily on the dark jerseys that will be worn for home games, but light away jerseys — either white or off-white — were also included in some teams’ social media posts. After teams played the 2024 season using just their geographic names, the PWHL unveiled team names and logos in early September. The teams retained the primary colours they wore during the PWHL’s inaugural season, though some added additional colours. “Players and fans alike have been waiting for this moment and we couldn’t be happier with the six unique looks each team will don moving forward,” said Amy Scheer, PWHL Senior Vice President of Business Operations, on the league’s website. “These jerseys mark the latest evolution in our league’s history, and we can’t wait to see them showcased both on the ice and in the stands.”  Each team will have contrasting shoulder yokes, with the PWHL logo on the right shoulder and space for advertising patches on the left shoulder and right chest. Each team also has an insert at the front of the collar with the PWHL logo inside. Teams will all use the same block number font, but each will have small team-specific icons in the numbers. Each jersey incorporates elements that embody the spirit of the team, all while supporting athletes on the ice with advanced materials and construction. Through a series of design sessions, unique elements such as stripe size, number style, and the crest were meticulously developed to enhance their identities. Crafted from breathable and durable fabrics, these jerseys are engineered to withstand intense physical play and offer a tailored fit for maximum mobility, comfort, and aesthetic appeal. The PWHL worked closely with Creative Agency Flower Shop in creating the jersey designs as part of the overall team brand identity work.  The jersey design process was led by PWHL Vice President of Brand and Marketing Kanan Bhatt-Shah and done in collaboration with New York-based creative agency Flower Shop, which also worked on the team names and logos. Here’s a closer look at the new jerseys and what the league had to say about them in Thursday’s announcement: Anchored by the team’s signature “B” across the chest, the Fleet’s home jersey features a deep green base, complemented by oceanic blue accents on the shoulders, sleeve stripes, and waist. The classic hockey design incorporates alternating bands of color, forming a wave-like pattern that evokes a strong connection to the sea. The numbers on Boston’s jersey carry a unique wave motif inspired by the crest, further reinforcing its maritime heritage.  The Frost’s home jersey embraces the chill with a deep purple base that channels the spirit of Minnesota winters. White accents on the shoulders, arms, and waist add a crisp, icy contrast, capturing the sharpness of the frozen landscape. Light purple details introduce a modern touch, blending seamlessly to create a layered, frosted look that embodies both the intensity and elegance of the Frost on the ice. The jersey numbers feature a motif inspired by the shape of the team’s crest, bringing a distinct edge to the design.  Anchored by the burgundy base, the Victoire’s home jersey reflects Montréal’s timeless elegance and strength. The navy shoulders and dynamic sleeve design draw inspiration from the angular lines of the team’s crest, adding a sense of movement and precision. A bright blue stripe accents the overall design, providing a vivid contrast while maintaining a classic style that honors the heritage of both the city and team. The jersey numbers are adorned with a Fleur-de-lys motif, reinforcing Montréal’s cultural pride.  Inspired by the hexagonal shape of their team crest, the Sirens’ home jersey captures the spirit of New York’s multifaceted energy. Angular sleeve stripes, echoing the crest’s geometric form, combine the city’s signature navy, orange, and grey hues, creating a striking, modern motif. The lower waist reflects the same hexagonal pattern, grounding the design in New York’s intense and dynamic identity. The numbers on New York’s jersey feature linework inspired by sound vibrations, echoing the city’s constant hum and buzz.  The Charge’s home jersey energizes the ice with its vibrant red base, embodying Ottawa’s unyielding drive. Dark and light grey bands run across the sleeves and waist, adding depth and a sense of momentum, while a bold pop of electric yellow pulses through the design. The overall look captures the energy and intensity that defines the Charge’s fierce presence on the ice. Custom numbers on the jersey incorporate small electrical charges, adding a spark to the back of the jersey.  The Sceptres’ home jersey reflects a modern, confident Toronto, with a rich blue base that captures the city’s leadership and pride. Navy paneling along the sleeves and waist brings depth and contrast, while clean, precise yellow lines and a matching collar add sharp, dynamic details. The striking gold and yellow of the team crest stands out, creating a look with bold presence, embodying the energy and spirit of Toronto fans. Custom numbers nod to the Sceptres’ crest design. Last season, the PWHL ran a pilot project during which Molson Breweries paid to place its logo on the upper back of jerseys, allowing nameplates to be placed under the numbers where they wouldn’t be covered by players’ long hair. Based on the photos released with Thursday’s announcement, it appears this pilot project will not continue in the upcoming season. PWHL home jerseys are available to buy now on the league’s official online shop. They’ll be available through Bauer’s website and key retailers starting on Thursday, November 14. The 2024-25 PWHL regular season begins on Saturday, November 30, when the Boston Fleet visit the Toronto Sceptres at the Coca-Cola Coliseum at 2 p.m. ET. Later that same day is an all-Canadian matchup between the Ottawa Charge and the Victoire de Montréal at Place Bell in Laval, Quebec. The defending champion Minnesota Frost open their season on Sunday, December 1, when they host the New York Sirens at the Xcel Energy Center."
SportsLogos.Net News,Australian Football League’s Adelaide Crows Flying High With Launch of New Logo,https://news.sportslogos.net/2024/11/06/australian-football-leagues-adelaide-crows-flying-high-with-launch-of-new-logo/other/,"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 20:50:49 +0000","New logo depicts full body of swooping crow — in stark contrast to previous version, which only depicted crow's head — with red and gold streaks in wings","The Adelaide Crows of the Australian Football League are flying high with the unveiling of their new logo this week, which is part of a club-wide rebranding effort. The Crows launched the new logo on their website and social media channels on Wednesday, November 6. It depicts the full body of a navy blue swooping crow — a throwback to previous logos in the club’s history and a stark contrast to the most recent iteration of their logo, which only depicted a crow’s head — with a gold outline, red and gold streaks in the wings and a red eye. The angles of the logo are sharper than the previous version, and the color scheme returns to the club’s “original bolder colors,” including a darker shade of navy blue, a “richer” red and a “deeper” gold. The logo is a celebration of the Club being born from the state’s thriving football landscape in 1990, with the wing of the Crow emanating from the actual shape of South Australia. In a further change, the word ‘Adelaide’ now solely sits below the crow and reinforces the connection between the Club, the city and state.  The new Crows logo was developed in partnership with Fuller Brand Communication, a creative agency based in South Australia. The process involved “widespread consultation with members, supporters and focus groups, such as the Member Engagement Panel.” The Crows’ logo was last revamped in 2010. Their first crest upon joining the AFL in 1991 featured a crow with swooping red, yellow and blue lines behind it inside a white shield with a red outline; “ADELAIDE” and “CROWS” were written out above the crow in yellow on a navy background. In 1996, the writing was changed to emphasize the city name. Then, from 1999-2009, the club ditched the shield and used the crow with the swooping lines behind on its own, with the team name in navy underneath. “The logo is one of the Club’s most recognisable features and our supporters take great pride in it, and the throwback to the original swooping Crow reinforces our connection to this city and state by the way it now incorporates the actual shape of South Australia,” said Crows CEO Tim Silvers on the team’s website. “We also wanted to make sure we celebrated our heritage but with a modern look and feel, which we think will resonate with our next generation of supporters. We’ve consulted and listened to a wide range of stakeholders, including and most importantly sections of our supporter base, over the past 18 months.  “Now is the perfect time to make this change as our new headquarters at Thebarton Oval is moving closer and closer to reality, so it really is the start of a new era.”  New guernseys were not unveiled as part of Wednesday’s announcement. But merchandise with the new logo is already available on the Crows’ official website and at the team shop in the Adelaide suburb of West Lakes. The Crows are the first of three teams who were reported to be unveiling new logos this offseason to do so. The other two teams named in an article on the AFL website in August are St. Kilda Football Club and Gold Coast Suns."

Napoli unveiled the new kits on Saturday, November 2, and wore them the following day in a match at home against Atalanta. The predominantly dark grey kit is inspired by Japanese culture and the twinning of Naples and Kagoshima, Japan, which have been sister cities since 1960. The tonal pattern on the kit is a mixture of Japanese and Italian artistic styles. It includes several Samurai objects — including the kabuto (helmet), the menpo (mask) and the katana sword — while melding a Japanese wave motif with a Neopolitan baroque style. Down the right side of the shirt are Japanese characters representing the seven Bushido virtues that are the principles of the Samurai: righteousness, respect, courage, honor, compassion, honesty and loyalty. Despite being so far away from each other, the twinning of the two ports is a symbol of their affinity and the unique characteristics that they share, from the gulfs to the volcanos that dominate the landscape: Vesuvius in Naples and Sakurajima in Kagoshima. The friendship between the two cities has led both of them to dedicate street names to each other: “Napoli-dori” (Naples street) in Kagoshima and “Via Kagoshima” in Naples. The collar, side panels and sleeve cuffs feature black trim, while the Napoli crest and sponsor logos on the chest are light blue. The kit was designed in collaboration with the Ten Shin – Cuore di Cielo Puro Soto Zen Temple in Naples and the Samurai Academy Naples. “The third kit perfectly places itself at the heart of our project ‘From Napoli to the World,’” said Tommaso Bianchini, the club’s chief revenue officer. “Starting in Naples, we arrive at the Japanese city of Kagoshima to tell the story of the relationship between these two distant cultures that are linked by a warrior’s spirit. With this shirt, we celebrate strength, respect and loyalty, which are values that we proudly bring onto the pitch.” Napoli’s next Serie A match is on Sunday, November 10, when they travel to the San Siro to face defending champions Inter Milan."

The wordmark and number font on the off-white uniforms matches the signage seen around the United Center, including gate and seat numbers, while the overall color scheme was based on the exterior of the building, with shades of brown, gray and white.  Details steeped in history.@MotorolaUS | https://t.co/PqhESWUXtq pic.twitter.com/ZyZc75upU7 The design across the shoulders and down the sides of the shorts are supposed to mimic in-arena lights during the Bulls’ starting lineup introductions, while the logo on the waistband pulls inspiration from the windows near the top of the United Center’s walls. The uniforms are complete with the Bulls’ iconic diamond-shaped shorts design and a uniquely shaped logo above the jock tag on the jersey, which pays homage to the original marquee that stood outside of the arena and read “Home of The Bulls.” Chicago will wear its new City Edition uniforms eight times this season, including games against the Memphis Grizzlies on Nov. 23, Boston Celtics n Dec. 21, Milwaukee Bucks on Dec. 28, New York Knicks on Jan. 4, Philadelphia 76ers on Jan. 25, Golden State Warriors on Feb. 8, Phoenix Suns on Feb. 22 and Dallas Mavericks on March 29. The Bulls’ 2023-24 City Edition uniforms, meanwhile, were inspired by the old Chicago Stadium, which stood on the Near West Side for nearly 60 years before it was replaced by the United Center in 1994 and was affectionally referred to as the “Madhouse on Madison.”"

The club officially announced today that they are now known simply as Athletics. The new location-less name will stick for as long as the team plays in Sacramento, which looks like it will be for the next three seasons before they move to Las","The Oakland Athletics are no longer. The club officially announced today that they are now known simply as Athletics. The new location-less name will stick for as long as the team plays in Sacramento, which looks like it will be for the next three seasons before they move to Las Vegas, where *I assume* they’ll be known as the Las Vegas Athletics. Once they take the field, this will be the first time in North America’s “Big Four” major sports leagues that a team has officially played a game without a location name in 80 years. The closest we saw to this in recent times was when the Anaheim Angels became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and spent the next decade referring to themselves only as the Angels in just about everything aside from their preferred abbreviation, “LAA.” There’s really no obvious reason for the Athletics to go this route. The team already owns the trademarks for both Sacramento Athletics and Sacramento A’s. They could’ve proceeded just as the Angels did previously and reserved the use of Sacramento for standings and scoreboards while sticking to “Athletics” on their uniforms and all official releases. Along with the official name change came the official primary logo the Athletics will use while playing in Sacramento. There’s no surprise here; they’ll use just the “A’s” portion of Oakland’s logo, removing the green circle and the team name. Club officials had previously revealed the team’s uniforms would remain largely the same when they shifted to Sacramento, with all the “Oakland” logos replaced with “Athletics.” This would mean changes only to their road greys and Kelly green alternate jerseys. According to a post from @EvanDrellich on Twitter, the Athletics request the following: The club should be referred to only as “Athletics,” with the shorthand “A’s” allowed only after they’ve already been called Athletics. The team abbreviation will now be “ATH,” so you’ll see this on the TV scoreboards instead of “OAK” going forward. The A’s also do *not* play in Sacramento (my bad); they play in *West* Sacramento (maybe this is why they didn’t go with Sacramento Athletics?). They also mentioned the change, as I discussed earlier, to their primary logo. The name change has already been reflected in the club’s online presence. The team is now listed second alphabetically between Arizona and Atlanta, appearing only as “Athletics” on MLB.com’s team selection list as well as their online shop at MLBShop.com. The team’s official Twitter and Instagram accounts also have removed all references to Oakland."

The Women’s Pro Baseball League (WPBL) announced last week that they are aiming to throw out their first pitch in less than two years’ time. The league is co-founded by Justine Siegal, also the founder of Baseball for All and the first woman to coach a professional men’s baseball team and to pitch batting practice against a Major League Baseball team. The logo on the league’s website depicts the letters in “WPBL” connected to each other, set in white on a black background. A baseball is depicted to the left of the W, aligned with the bottom of the letters. The league name is spelled to the right. The WPBL is also using a secondary logo as their social media profile picture. This logo consists of the W from the league logo, along with the baseball. Unlike the website, though, the background on this logo is navy blue. The WPBL will re-write history by creating an elite league that provides the world’s best female players with the platform they deserve and serve as a catalyst for the creation of a women’s baseball culture in America. “I am so excited that there will finally be a professional women’s baseball league – it is a dream come true for all the girls and women who play America’s Pastime,” Siegal said in a press release. “The Women’s Pro Baseball League is here for all the girls and women who dream of a place to showcase their talents and play the game they love. We have been waiting over 70 years for a professional baseball league we can call our own. Our time is now.” The WPBL’s other co-founder is Keith Stein, a Toronto-based lawyer and businessman who also serves as CEO of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Intercounty Baseball League. IBL players are college players and former professionals, and all nine teams are based in Southern Ontario. “We believe that the success of other women’s professional leagues such as the WNBA and NWSL demonstrates the incredible interest and support for women’s sport,” Stein said. Legendary Japanese pitcher Ayami Sato has joined the league as a special advisor, as has former Toronto Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston. The WPBL said in its press release that it will launch in summer 2026 with six teams based largely in the northeastern United States. Team names and logos were not included in last week’s announcement. The league also hopes to have a national broadcasting deal in place by the time the first pitch is thrown. More details about the league — including information for prospective team owners and players — is available on the WPBL website.  No related stories."

Numbers to know for Week 9📰: https://t.co/BortIHSW58 pic.twitter.com/uDrzHXhIUF That includes the New York Giants breaking out their 1980-99 throwback uniforms for Sunday’s game against the Washington Commanders, marking the third straight year they’ll make an appearance against their NFC East rival. The uniforms feature a navy blue helmet with an underlined and italicized “Giants” wordmark on both sides, a royal blue jersey with a classic striping pattern on the collar and cuffs and white pants with red and blue stripes.  New York is 3-0-1 in the throwback uniforms since they debuted two years ago, including victories over the Chicago Bears in 2022 and the Commanders and Green Bay Packers in 2023. They also tied with Washington in 2022. TURN US UP. It's Kelly Green Week! pic.twitter.com/7y0wDacGX6 Elsewhere in the division, the Philadelphia Eagles will wear their Kelly green throwback uniforms on Sunday afternoon against the Jacksonville Jaguars, marking their third straight appearance against an AFC opponent.  The uniforms replicate the Randall Cunningham and Reggie White era, with Kelly green helmets and Kelly green jerseys featuring white block numbers outlined in black and the Eagles’ 1987-95 alternate logo on the sleeves. Philadelphia went 2-0 in the throwback uniforms after unveiling them prior to last season, including wins over the Miami Dolphins and Buffalo Bills. They’ll also be worn later this season against the Dallas Cowboys on Dec. 29.  A classic look for a classic matchup#DETvsGB pic.twitter.com/NdhHY37ayw Keeping with the theme, the Green Bay Packers will wear their 1950s throwback uniforms during Sunday’s game against the Detroit Lions, marking their first appearance against an NFC North divisional opponent. The uniforms are reminiscent of what the Packers wore from 1950-53, with green jerseys featuring gold numbers and two gold stripes on the sleeves, green pants with a single gold stripe down the sides and green socks with stripes that match the sleeves.  The Packers are 2-1 in the throwback threads since they were unveiled, including wins over the Washington Football Team in 2021 and Los Angeles Chargers last season. Their lone loss came at the hands of the New York Jets in 2022. Taking advantage of the opportunity.MNF 🔜 pic.twitter.com/XsxlPSgHRm The weekend will end with visual rematch of Super Bowl LV, with the Kansas City Chiefs wearing their standard home uniforms when they host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers – who will wear their road white jerseys and pewter pants – on Monday Night Football. Interestingly, the Buccaneers were considered the home team in that matchup, which they won 31-9, but chose to wear their white jerseys in the Super Bowl after having success in that combination throughout the 2020-21 playoffs."

Not a hard chokehold; just enough to secure him. And he kept holding him. And that's when everyobody totally realized what was going on.' Marine vet Daniel Penny used a by-the-book chokehold to subdue a repeat violent felon, Jordan Neely, who was threatening New Yorkers on the subway. Eyewitnesses testified that he only stopped Neely when the latter became violent. After the chokehold, Penny is on video placing Neely in the recovery position to make sure Neely was safe. Nearby passengers praised him for his heroic efforts. Police testified that Jordan Neely was still alive when officers showed up and they administered Narcan to reverse a suspected overdose. Police also testified that they didn't administer mouth-to-mouth because Neely looked ""very dirty"" and officers were concerned about getting hepatitis. Neely was on a list of the Top 50 most ""at-risk"" homeless people in New York city and was known to police. Penny has disavowed the DA's assertion that there was any racial animus involved in subduing Neely. Despite this, DA Alvin Bragg's deputy keeps referring to Penny in court as ""the white man."" Witnesses testified at trial that Neely was ""trying to attack everybody"" on the train. This bodycam footage now shows eyewitnesses at the scene saying that Penny acted with proper restraint in subduing a violent man.  PS - Here's some bonus reading, courtesy of the libs:

As we noted in our own review, the Vision Pro is very expensive, bulky, heavy, awkward to use, minimally supported, and overall just a crummy experience for a lot of money. Apple CEO Tim Cook, however, is putting on a brave face: 'Right now, it's an early-adopter product,' Cook said late last month, in a sprawling interview.'People who want to have tomorrow's technology today - that's who it's for. Fortunately, there's enough people who are in that camp that it's exciting.' 'People who want to have tomorrow's technology today - that's who it's for.

She snipped, she tucked, and with utmost care, she sewed their sniffers right up in the air!

Super glad Elon snapped back at SNL here, because without this little jab we would've never heard from SNL actress Chloe Fineman as to how and why Elon Musk made her cry when he hosted the show back in 2021. I'll save you the suspense while reminding you that, yes, the entire SNL crew was extremely triggered, and multiple members cried when it was Elon's week to host the show. Here's Chloe to explain how Elon made her cry on that sad, sad week in New York City:   Okay, I just saw some news article about Elon Musk being butt hurt about ‘SNL' and his impression … I'm gonna come out and say at long last that I'm the cast member that he made cry. And he's the host that made someone cry.Maybe there's others … But I'm like, no, if you're gonna go on your platform and be rude, like, guess what? You made I, Chloe Fineman, burst into tears because I stayed up all night writing the sketch. I was so excited, I came in, I asked if you had any questions and you stared at me like you were firing me from Tesla and were like, ‘It's not funny.' I waited for you to be like, ‘Ha ha, jk.' No. Then you started pawing through my script, like flipping each page, being, like, ‘I didn't laugh once, not one time.'Cut to the sketch made it on and it was like fine and I actually had a really good time and I thought you were really funny in it. But, you know, have a little manners here, sir. Maybe there's others … But I'm like, no, if you're gonna go on your platform and be rude, like, guess what? You made I, Chloe Fineman, burst into tears because I stayed up all night writing the sketch. I was so excited, I came in, I asked if you had any questions and you stared at me like you were firing me from Tesla and were like, ‘It's not funny.' I waited for you to be like, ‘Ha ha, jk.'

But, you know, have a little manners here, sir. So Elon Musk says SNL is a dying brand and this lady's response is to tell the whole world a story about the time when she wrote a terrible script that wasn't funny and Elon, who has Asperger's, told her it wasn't funny to her face - and then she cried!  I mean, if you can't write comedy, you can't write comedy. If people aren't going to tell you you can't write comedy, that makes them dishonest chumps. Oh, and if you need proof that the sketch wasn't funny, here it is. Bro, who seriously comes out and admits to the internet that the richest man in the world made them cry because he didn't like their comedy sketch? That's something you keep to yourself, unless, of course, you're just dying for attention.

But one of the laws on the list has even Milei's supporters freaking out: Law No. 20.843 (1974), which established the ""Padrinazgo Presidencial"" or presidential godfather, based off a tradition started in 1907. Apparently, if a mother gives birth to a seventh son or seventh daughter, that seventh same-gendered child is cursed to become a ""lobizón"" or a werewolf when the moon is full, unless the leader of the nation performs a sacred rite and becomes the child's godfather.  The rite involves attending the child's baptism, placing a gold medal around their neck, giving them a scholarship towards their education, and giving them a nominal fee ranging from $150 to $300 per year for life. More than 12,000 children are estimated to have become godsons or goddaughters to an Argentine president in the past 117 years. Former President Alberto Fernández, who left office in 2023, became a godfather to 66 children, while his predecessor, Mauricio Macri, godfathered 159. Before them, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, a staunch Peronist, granted the benefit to 1,152 children during her term. (There is no official count for how many werewolves Milei has prevented at this point in his presidency, if any.)  The tradition comes from several different sources. The Portuguese legend of ""wolf men"" came to Argentina through Brazil (apparently most ""werewolf"" sightings are near the Brazilian border). According to historian and journalist Alejandro Galliano, Catherine the Great of Russia ""believed in becoming the godmother to the seventh son to prevent him from becoming a werewolf."" Immigrants from the Volga region of Russia introduced the practice and it was a Russian farmer, Enrique Brest, who first asked then-President José Figueroa Alcorta to become godfather to his seventh son. The 1974 law made this practice official and included daughters.  Milei's Minister of Deregulation and State Transformation, Federico Sturzenegger, stated the law was a waste of taxpayer money. Law No. 20.843 (1974) establishes the (medieval) figure of 'Presidential Patronage' which has no place in a modern democracy. However, the citizens of Argentina were quick to push back on the idea of getting rid of the law.  I am in favor of maintaining the anti-wolf cub law.  NOT WHAT I VOTED FOR. The Presidential Patronage Law protects us from werewolves.  WHAT DO YOU WANT TO REMOVE THE PRESIDENTIAL SPONSORSHIP FOR???!! HAVE YOU GONE CRAZY?? DO YOU WANT WEREWOLVES??. LEAVE THE MOST MYSTICAL LAW OF THE COUNTRY IN PEACE OR THE GOVERNMENT IS OVER. And my personal favorite:  Sport hunters from all over the world will come to hunt werewolves.This boosts international tourism. This boosts international tourism.

Senior leadership will lie to you and say that they do not know, but if you ask the DSA crew leads and specialists what they are experiencing in the field, they will tell you.  Marn'i said withholding [checks notes] federal assistance from the majority of her countrymen in Florida was justified because [checks notes again] those people who vote differently than her would have been hostile (she just knows this in her soul). Do you think she's telling the truth about the widespread avoidance of Trump supporters, or is she just trying to deflect heat? And if her allegations are true and critical aid was withheld from destroyed communities in states like North Carolina, where over a hundred people are dead, was the withholding of such aid responsible for any of these deaths??

(The following video is from 2016, but it works here so I'm leaving it.)  Multiple outlets have begun reporting that Trump is making his picks, starting with Florida Senator Marco Rubio as Secretary of State. President-elect Trump is expected to nominate Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida as Secretary of State, a source familiar tells Fox News.The source noted that while Trump could still change his mind at the last minute, as of now he's planning on offering the job to Rubio, the three-term senator whom the former president considered as his running mate this summer before naming Sen. JD Vance as the GOP vice presidential nominee ...Rubio, who sits on both the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, has taken similar positions to Trump on international conflicts, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Israel's war with Hamas.In April, the 53-year-old senator voted against the $95 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine and has urged the eastern European nation to negotiate an end to its war with Russia.

In April, the 53-year-old senator voted against the $95 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine and has urged the eastern European nation to negotiate an end to its war with Russia. Yes, it seems like Rubio has begun aligning himself with the Trump agenda when it comes to foreign conflicts, and he appears to be on the fast track to the Secretary of State position. The other reported pick is a bit more out of left field: South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as the Director of Homeland Security.  Noem would replace the utterly awful Alejandro Mayorkas in overseeing Customs and Border Patrol, FEMA, ICE, and the Secret Service. And if there is anyone who is going to run their department as a Trump loyalist who will fight for the President's agenda, you can expect Noem to do so. Other key positions reportedly filled by the President-elect include: Chief of Staff: Susie Wiles, Trump's 2024 campaign manager. National Security Adviser: Mike Waltz, 3-term Florida Congressman, National Guard veteran, and former Pentagon policy adviser. Border Czar: Tom Homan.  (Enough said.) United Nations Ambassador: Elise Stefanik, Congresswoman, New York. MAGA Republican. Third-ranking member of Congress after replacing Liz Cheney as House Republican Conference Chair. Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy: Stephen Miller. Yes, that Stephen Miller. The man behind Trump's immigration agenda since 2015. Environmental Protection Agency: Lee Zeldin, Congressman, New York. MAGA Republican. A mix of insiders and outsiders, but, so far, there's no doubt that all of these folks are Trump picks and Trump loyalists, which appears to be his primary motivation for selecting his cabinet.

	There was some extra juice in the building for Klay Thompson's return to the Bay, and Steph reminded the fans whose house it was late.","The biggest game of the night in a packed slate of NBA Cup games was the Mavs taking on the Warriors in Klay Thompson’s first game back in San Francisco since leaving as a free agent this summer for Dallas.  It was an emotional scene as they played a terrific tribute video and had the crowd in captains hats to honor their former star, but once the game got going there was plenty of juice on both sides in a reunion that wasn’t all happy. The two teams went back and forth, as the stars on both sides all played their roles, with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combining for 52 for the Mavs, while Thompson hit 6 threes on his way to 22 points in his return, including a big one late that gave Dallas a five-point lead midway through the fourth quarter.  That lead would get up to seven before Stephen Curry took over for the Warriors, scoring 12 points in the final 3:10 of game time, including a personal 10-0 run (aided by some spectacular defense from Draymond Green) that turned a Golden State deficit into a 4-point Warriors lead. His final bucket of that run was a vintage stepback three-pointer over Dereck Lively II, as he hit the Mavs big man with his signature “night night” celebration, before making a demonstrative declaration to the crowd that “this is my sh*t.”  STEPH CURRY HAS THE LAST 10 WARRIORS POINTS. 10-2 run to put GSW up 4 with under 30 seconds. 🏆 DAL-GSW | West Group C action🏀 #EmiratesNBACup on TNT pic.twitter.com/xNxak7xWr5 — NBA (@NBA) November 13, 2024  The Mavs would hit a three to cut the lead to one, but a pair of Curry free throws and a missed Luka three saw the Warriors win in regulation, 120-117. Curry finished with 37 points in the win, and while it’s clear there’s not actual bad blood between either side in the Splash Bros. breakup, there did seem to be a little extra fire from Curry for a mid-November game to make a statement at home with Klay now on the other side. While the “night night” is nothing new, the jersey popping and yelling “this is my sh*t” was more than we ever see from Curry in a non-playoff environment, and while I am a fan of the NBA Cup and think it brings out more competition in these games, I think this had more to do with who was on the other side than the Cup ramifications of this game."

It’s probably safe to assume that Embiid will be fine as long as he can manage whatever is up with his knee, while the Sixers — which find themselves 2-8 at this early juncture — have to get him, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey all healthy and clicking as soon as possible. But even if that happens, Shaquille O’Neal is not optimistic about Philly’s ability to win a ring with Embiid at the center of things, which he expressed at halftime on TNT. “In New York, it’s a tough team to play,” O’Neal said. “But this was the fear I had for Joel Embiid. You announce arrogantly, I’m not playing back-to-backs, Ernie. I’m not injured but I’m sore. I’ll come back when I want to come back. Now, when you say things like that, you’re supposed to come back with extra energy. 0-for-3? I would have been 0-15. But you know what y’all would have said. ‘Hey, Shaq’s not playing well, but he’s playing aggressive.’ The plan that they are having, it’s not working. And not only that, I say this respectfully, Joel Embiid will never win a championship until he gets his mind and his attitude right.” Shaq has essentially staked out a place in the basketball punditry world as the guy who will call out big men when he feels they aren’t living up to what they’re capable of, and clearly, he thinks Embiid is the kind of guy who can lead Philadelphia to a championship. In fairness to Embiid, while he did say he may not play in back-to-backs going forward in an effort to be healthy when the playoffs roll around, he said after the loss to the Knicks that he wants to play in Wednesday’s game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, even if the decision is out of his hands."

	With the game tied in overtime, Miami tried calling a timeout. There was just one problem: They didn't have one available.","The second annual Emirates NBA Cup tipped off on Tuesday night, with a number of teams taking the (very vibrant) floor for the league’s relatively new in-season tournament. In the East Group B, the Detroit Pistons played host to the Miami Heat and looked like they were going to cruise to a win before Miami got hot down the stretch of regulation. With things tied up, the two teams went into overtime, where Miami was able to take a lead with just under two seconds left before things got very, very weird. First, the Pistons drew up a beautiful sideline out of bounds play to get a dunk for Jalen Duren that tied things up. And then, a furious Erik Spoelstra walked onto the court and called a timeout. There was just one problem: Miami didn’t have one, which meant we had a classic Chris Webber situation on our hands — perhaps it was fate that one of Webber’s Fab 5 teammates, Jalen Rose, was in attendance and lost his mind. Malik Bealey stepped up to the free throw line, buried it to put Detroit ahead, then on the ensuing Pistons possession, got fouled one more time with 0.1 seconds left to seal the game. It was, quite frankly, stunning to watch Spoelstra make such a big mistake, but at the very least, we got a really entertaining end to a game that suddenly has some stakes to it because of the NBA Cup."

	Caitlin Clark found a very unique pitfall of fame at The Eras Tour: Getting so many friendship bracelets you start to lose circulation.","Taylor Swift’s “The Eras Tour” has been the biggest show in the world for the past few years, as the tour has had millions of fans pass through the gates at stadiums around the globe. After finishing her international leg of the tour, Swift added another run of U.S. tour dates, which included recently playing three nights in Indianapolis at the start of November.  In attendance for those shows was the biggest sports star in the city at present, as Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark wasn’t about to miss a chance to see her favorite artist play shows in her new home city. The only problem for Caitlin at the Eras Tour was that she’s too popular in Indianapolis, which meant she was being constantly given friendship bracelets from other Swifties. That’s a very nice problem to have, but in her effort to wear every one she was given, it started to create an issue, as she explained at the Women’s Leadership Summit.  “Taylor Swift, I just went two nights in a row in Indianapolis. I’ve been three times,” Clark said. “I had a ton [of bracelets], all the way up the arms. I had to take them off, my circulation was getting cut off! Everyone was just chucking their bracelets at me. I’ve seen her three times, and every time the show has just gotten better.”  She showed off her collection on Instagram during one of the shows and it was a lot of bracelets.  Clark has spent the last year or two learning the ups and downs of life as a superstar, but this is certainly a very unique pitfall of fame, being so popular you get too many friendship bracelets and start to lose feeling in your arm."

	The NBA Cup is back for a second season, and here's how it will all work and what groups each team ended up in.","The NBA’s efforts to add a little excitement to the doldrums of its regular season will return on Tuesday evening. For the second straight year, the league will hold its new cup competition, now known as the Emirates NBA Cup. The first year was fun, with the Los Angeles Lakers winning the whole thing by knocking off the Indiana Pacers in Las Vegas, and now, the NBA will continue its efforts to turn this nascent event into a crucial part of its calendar. What does this all mean? Well, we tried to answer that today by explaining what’s new this year, how the whole thing will work, and why we’re excited to watch this as it tries to become a tentpole event on the NBA calendar. So is this just the In-Season Tournament but with a new name? It is! While the NBA has never explicitly said this, my assumption is that they spent the first year calling it the In-Season Tournament so fans would get a sense of what it is before calling it what they always wanted to call it: The NBA Cup, or more specifically, the Emirates NBA Cup. Or maybe they just couldn’t find a sponsor in the first year. What’s that Emirates thing? I’ve seen its logo on courts but never actually looked into what it is. It’s an airline based out of the United Arab Emirates that sponsors a lot of stuff. They’re sponsoring this event, which is the second-best thing that the NBA does, and fortunately, Emirates has plenty of experience sponsoring the second-best thing, as they are the shirt sponsor for Arsenal. What? Just let me cook. Ok, so, any major differences from last year other than the name? A big one are the courts. Last year, they came under criticism from players (who kept slipping on them) and fans (who thought some were huge eyesores, particularly because of the weird, cumbersome stripe they had going down the middle of the courts). They’re not nearly as bad this year, as they replaced the stripe with rings in the center of the floor and got rid of some of the more abrasive designs that just do not work on television. I’m sure not everyone will love them, but I think they are a huge improvement on last year — we just have to see if players struggle with their footing on them, or else the aesthetic changes do not matter at all. What about point differential? I know some players disliked that. Well, that’s still sticking around as a potential tiebreaker for which teams do and do not advance. Frankly, I think it’s fine and we saw last year that some of the European players were trying to egg their teammates on — Domantas Sabonis was the main one I remember — but it’ll still take a bit of a shift for everyone to get on board with it. Remind me how determining how teams advance will work again? Sure! Right from the league: So the easiest way to move on is to just win your group and not worry about any tiebreakers. That is correct. Well then, what do the groups look like? Once again, the NBA broke things up into three groups of five teams in each conference — this will, hopefully, look a lot cleaner when expansion happens, we get up to 32 teams, and they can do groups of four in each conference where each team plays group games home and away. The group games will happen on Tuesdays and Fridays starting tonight and running through Dec. 3. Here’s how it all looks: West Group A: Minnesota, LA Clippers, Sacramento, Houston, Portland West Group B: Oklahoma City, Phoenix, LA Lakers, Utah, San Antonio West Group C: Denver, Dallas, New Orleans, Golden State, Memphis East Group A: New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Charlotte East Group B: Milwaukee, Indiana, Miami, Toronto, Detroit East Group C: Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington How do these teams qualify for the knockouts? Same as last year — win your group and you get a spot. Both conferences then get one remaining spot for a wild card team, which goes to the best remaining team that did not automatically qualify by winning its group. This is probably where those aforementioned tiebreakers would come in, but you never know. And will the knockouts work like last year, too? Yup! Single-elimination basketball games, with the quarterfinals happening on-site at home arenas and the semifinals and final happening in Las Vegas. The quarters are on Dec. 10 and 11, the semis are on Dec. 14, and the final is on Dec. 17. And are these games all considered regular season games, too? For the most part they are — group games, the quarters, and the semis will all count towards regular season records again, while the championship game will not. So it looks a lot like last year, then. That’s right, the league has, essentially, decided to keep a lot of things the same other than the name and the courts. Oh, also, as a programming note: home teams will wear their Statement Edition uniforms, while road teams wear their Association edition uniforms, according to the league. Huh, well then, ok. You don’t seem enthused about all of this, dear reader. Yeah, I mean, I am still unsure why I should care about this. Well that’s easy: You don’t have to! You’re an adult with agency and the ability to care about whatever you want, times are tough, maybe you don’t want to get super personally invested in a new thing the NBA is doing, that’s fine. But you seem to like this. I do! Why? I think a big split I have noticed here is “fans who like soccer” and “fans who do not,” with the former being more open to the idea of a midseason cup competition — Adam Silver has compared the NBA Cup to the FA Cup in English football, but basically every domestic league has a secondary cup competition. The thing is that these competitions are universally considered not as important as winning the league, but they are still important because it’s an opportunity to win something historic and provide some validation for a team’s season. The NBA Cup is only in its second year, so clearly, it has a way to go before it gets taken that seriously — the whole saga with the Lakers debating putting up a little banner is an example of this. But the FA Cup, for example, is not considered cool because everyone farts around and then Manchester City wins it at the end. It’s considered cool because teams from several levels of English football have a chance to win it, and sometimes, you get magical runs to the very end. We got a glimpse of what that could look like last year when the Indiana Pacers nearly won the whole thing. Hell, if not for the fact that they’re the Lakers, it’d probably be viewed as proof of concept that the final was between a Play-In team and an upstart young squad trying to win something for the first time. That is, to steal a phrase from the English, the magic of the cup. So acknowledging that this isn’t as important as winning the NBA Finals is fine? One-hundred percent. The longer the NBA sticks with this — and, let’s face it, Silver is essentially staking his legacy as a commissioner on this becoming a big deal — the more likely it is that it’ll settle into a spot where fans/franchises like that it is a thing that they can win, all while understanding that the big prize is still waiting for them in June. It helps, of course, that there’s a financial incentive to do well. Remind me what that is. Sure! Players whose teams make the quarterfinals make $50,000, players whose teams make the semifinals make $100,000, players on the runners-up make $200,000, and players on the team that wins the whole thing makes $500,000. Nice. I agree. Anyway, this sounds like, bare minimum, a thing I can have on my television on Tuesdays and Fridays. It is, and really, if that’s all that comes from this for the next year or two, that’s totally fine. Something like this will only become a big deal the more it happens and the more it becomes ingrained as part of the sport’s culture, and as long as this year is a step towards doing that, I’m sure it’ll all work out in the long-run. Nice. Well, I suppose I can tune in. That you can, and if you want to know what games are on, when they’re on, and which networks they’ll be on, you can click right here."

	The NBA Cup starts Tuesday night and we are looking at eight teams that should invest a little extra energy in the early season competition.","The second edition of the NBA Cup (now with a fancy sponsor, Emirates) will begin on Tuesday night as group stage action gets started. Feelings on the NBA Cup vary, but for the most part, it seems to have been at least a mild positive in terms of adding a little juice to November regular season hoops.  Last year, the eight teams that emerged from group play were the Celtics, Bucks, Pacers, and Knicks in the East, and the Lakers, Kings, Suns, and Pelicans in the West. Ultimately, the Lakers beat the Pacers in the final, marking the high point of the season for Los Angeles, while that was just the beginning of a run to the conference finals from Indiana. There are differing views from teams on how they approach the Cup, but because most of the games until you get to Vegas count all the same as regular season games, you should see contenders still trying at least until the quarterfinals where they may punt to avoid adding a trip to Vegas to their schedule.  Not every team has the Cup schedule circled on their calendars, and for some, it gets in the way of the long-term goals (either to get lottery balls or winning a title). But as the Pacers showed a year ago, for a young team without much playoff experience, the Cup can get guys feet wet to that kind of environment and build some confidence for the tournament everyone cares about come April, May, and June.  Here, we’ll look at eight teams that we think should be willing to invest early season energy into trying to get to Vegas and hoist the NBA Cup.   Houston’s gotten off to a strong start this season at 7-4, and I think they’re in a similar position to the Pacers last year, as they can use this as a way to test their young roster without much playoff experience. A successful run to the knockout rounds (and maybe beyond) would be a genuinely big deal for the Rockets, who can assert themselves as a genuine threat in the West playoff race with a strong tournament showing.  We saw that the Lakers were willing to raise their level a year ago in the Cup competition, and it’d be kind of incredible if they went back-to-back. Their group is a bit less daunting now that the Thunder are without Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein (although that’s still an excellent team), and if they make the knockout rounds, a team with LeBron and AD is always going to be a threat in a single-elimination basketball game. We’ll see if they approach it with the same aggression, but this is a team that has to try and chase wins regardless, so I’d expect the effort to be there, even if they can’t replicate the same kind of run.  The Grizzlies want to prove they are fully back as West contenders, and they can make a strong statement if they come out of the aforementioned Group of Death. They are playing at a high level right now, led by Jaren Jackson Jr.’s continued brilliance, and if they can get to Vegas, they’d have a very good chance at lifting the Cup. And if Ja Morant can get healthy and come back in time, absolutely no one will want to see that guy in a one-off. By the time the season is over, the Spurs will likely have filtered out of the Play-In race, but this is the exact kind of team I think should place an overemphasis on the NBA Cup. The Spurs are still building around Victor Wembanyama and figuring out what that should look like, but this team has been fairly competitive early (5-6) and could take advantage of some injury woes for the top teams in their group to try and make a little noise in the Cup. We saw in the Olympics that Wemby loves some heightened competition, and this might be a good chance to turn him loose and make an all-out push for something in November, understanding that they probably don’t have the roster just yet to really threaten the playoffs.  Will the Cavs ever lose? At some point, yes, but why not keep the good vibes rolling as long as possible and try to win the Cup? Yes, they’re a title contender, but unlike, say, Boston, this isn’t a team that’s had any real playoff success. Building some good habits in the knockout rounds could pay dividends down the road, and seeing as how they’re in the same group as the Celtics, I’m sure they’d love to use this as a statement of intent in the event they cross paths in the postseason. The Bucks desperately need something to turn around their season, and maybe the Cup gives them a carrot to chase that can wake things up. I’m skeptical they have the juice to make this happen, as the vibes are just horrendous in Milwaukee right now, but theoretically, Giannis and Dame (who will miss their opener with a concussion) are good enough as a tandem to beat anyone. That will require them to get on the same page, which hasn’t really happened to this point, but perhaps playing on different courts can change the mojo in Milwaukee.  Like every team other than the Cavs and Celtics in the East, the Knicks are off to a sputtering start at 4-5. Their star-studded roster isn’t clicking just yet, the defense has taken a major step back, and the offense hasn’t been quite good enough to make up for it. Their group, at one point, looked like the toughest in the East, but the Magic are without Paolo Banchero and the Sixers … well, we’ll get to them in a second. That cracks the door for the Knicks to try and lay a foundation of winning they can build on as the season progresses and create that chemistry that’s been lacking in games with a slightly bigger game feel. Joel Embiid is back for the Cup games, but Tyrese Maxey is out and Paul George has been on a minutes restriction. This team is desperate to go on a run, and with the big fella back, there’s no time like the present to try and climb out of the East’s basement. Like the Bucks, Philly just needs to stack some wins and get some positivity, and if they can somehow make it to Vegas, they can erase a decent amount of the early season concern about them."

	Barrett did a literal double-take and couldn't stop from blurting out ""Game of Thrones!""","There is no team that has more celebrities attend their games than the Lakers (the Knicks being a close second), as the courtside seats at L.A. games often go a few rows deep with stars from the world of entertainment. There are the regulars like Jack Nicholson and Denzel Washington, but on any given night you might find an actor from your favorite TV show or movie watching the Lakers play.  That happened to Toronto wing RJ Barrett on Sunday night as the Raptors made their annual trek to Los Angeles. After finishing through contact for an and-1, Barrett turned to the crowd in the corner to celebrate only to find himself face-to-face with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, best known for playing Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones. Barrett realized this mid-celebration and did a literal double take, turned back to Coster-Waldau, pointed, and blurted out “Game of Thrones!” at him before turning around and walking to the free throw line.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  It’s a very funny thing to happen in the middle of an NBA game, but also, that’s exactly how I would react if I turned around and was suddenly face-to-face with the guy that played Jaime Lannister. I feel like this is far from the first time someone has pointed at Coster-Waldau and just yelled “Game of Thrones!” at him, as that is by far the role he’s best known for."

	We caught up with Liv Morgan after she made history as the first Women's Crown Jewel Champion.","Before kicking off the Liv Morgan World Tour, and before becoming the first Women’s Crown Jewel Champion, the current Women’s World Champion sat at home nursing a dislocated shoulder. As Liv Morgan recovered for six months throughout 2023, she says she had a moment of clarity.  Over the first decade of her career, she’d allowed her ring work to speak for itself. During her time away, Morgan took a step back and felt like she had lacked a true voice or character. As she plotted her return to the ring, she created the Liv Morgan Revenge Tour built around the realities of her injury, while envisioning a path back to the top of the WWE mountain.  “The Liv Morgan Revenge Tour,” Morgan tells Uproxx Sports, “gave me such a purpose.” Some of the best stories in professional wrestling have been at least somewhat based in reality, and the way Morgan was injured gave her a motive, direction, and something so personal and true, that it allowed her for the first time in her career to really sink her teeth into a story. “Rhea (Ripley) really did dislocate my shoulder,” Morgan says. “I really sat home for six months watching her ascend to the top of the division. And so it was all really personal to me, and I used all that to come back and do exactly to her what she did to me. But I did that and more.” While she’s navigated trying to find her character throughout a decade in WWE, elements of who Morgan is as a person have helped her continue to chip away at this dream. Her drive, passion, wanting to learn as much as she can, and desire to give herself an opportunity to see what she could achieve has brought her this far.  “(My time away) just gave me the time and space that I needed to really settle into my own, which brought out the best version of Liv Morgan than we’ve seen thus far,” Morgan says.  The last seven months have been a whirlwind for Morgan. She kicked off the Raw after WrestleMania 40 with a beatdown of Ripley that would alter the trajectory of her career. A legitimate shoulder injury suffered in the melee forced Ripley to relinquish the title and led to Morgan beating Becky Lynch for the belt. That win kickstarted the pivotal run of her career, with new twists and turns added by the month.  “I like to believe that everything happens for a reason. Even if you don’t know the reason, I know that’s so cliche, but I really live my life by that. And so even when things happen that I feel are bizarre or even unfortunate things, I always tend to think that on the other side of it, it is going to be for a greater purpose,” Morgan says.  “There’s so much beauty in the madness and it’s cool to be able to pivot and adjust when things aren’t going the way we anticipated it, because we took something that was supposed to be great and we made it even greater. And so I just think that the stars are aligned and everything is happening exactly as it should.” Morgan has embraced the “crazy, messy love triangle” that’s followed her dynamic with Dominik Mysterio and Ripley, “whether they love to hate us or hate to love us.” Mysterio switched allegiances, Morgan joined the Judgement Day while Ripley was ousted, Raquel Rodriguez returned to join her side, and Ripley recently suffered another injury that will sideline her for the foreseeable future. Paired alongside Mysterio and thus far able to hold off Ripley, Morgan isn’t just matching the status quo for a world champion — she’s literally doing things that haven’t been done before.  The latest in her evolution from charting a Revenge Tour to creating a Liv Morgan World Tour came with a championship-worthy diamond ring, after claiming the first-ever Women’s Crown Jewel Championship in a win over Nia Jax last week.  “It means so much to me on so many different levels,” Morgan continues. “We’ve made history in Saudi Arabia. We had the very first women’s title match for the Women’s Crown Jewel Championship. And that is so much progress. I feel like since I’ve started in WWE, all I’ve wanted to do is really carve my own path and see how great I could become. And the fact that I’ve made history and the first and only Women’s Crown Jewel Champion, I am just so proud and so honored. And I just hope that I do it justice.” The opportunities are endless for where Morgan goes from here. She’s open to the idea of a second Evolution all-women’s wrestling show, with a loaded roster across Raw, Smackdown, and NXT.  “I don’t think we need our own show to be more prestigious,” Morgan says. “I think we are prestigious and I think people tune in specifically for the women’s segments and for women’s wrestling. But to give the fans what they want is why I would love to have another all women’s show in Evolution part 2.” A WrestleMania main event is something that’s eluded Morgan across her career, but calls it the pinnacle of wrestling in WWE and is without a doubt an accomplishment she’d love to check off her bucket list. “You can’t get any bigger, higher, better, more prestigious than main eventing WrestleMania,” Morgan says. “I spend a lot of my life dreaming and hoping and wishing. And I’ve been fortunate and lucky and blessed enough to have a lot of those things come true. So yes, main eventing WrestleMania is definitely on my list. With whom, I don’t know what that looks like or what it is but I hope that we can find out together.” Morgan can accomplish just about anything because at this very moment she genuinely has the faith and belief that she can. As she continues to build upon her second world title run, the Liv Morgan we see onscreen every week couldn’t be any more different than the one that was Smackdown Champion two years ago.  “It’s just a different Liv Morgan. The Liv Morgan that won the SmackDown Championship from Ronda Rousey, that girl she was just happy to be there. She maybe didn’t even see herself or believe in herself as a champion yet. She was a girl with just a pipe dream, cash in her briefcase at the right moment in the right time,” Morgan says. “This Liv Morgan is the most confident version of herself so far. This Liv Morgan knows her worth. This Liv Morgan knows she’s the greatest women’s champion of all time. This Liv Morgan knows she’s untouchable. This Liv Morgan knows she has the most dominant faction in all of WWE by her side. That’s the difference.”"

	Holmgren fell hard on his right hip after contesting a shot and had to be helped off the floor without putting weight on his right leg.","The Oklahoma City Thunder entered Sunday tied with the Suns for the top spot in the Western Conference, and figured to face a stiff test with the red-hot Golden State Warriors in town. OKC got off to a strong start, taking a 33-26 lead after the first quarter, but there was some considerable concern about their star big man as Chet Holmgren had to be helped off the floor and into the locker room after landing hard on his right hip after contesting an Andrew Wiggins layup attempt at the rim (watch here).  Holmgren slams down onto the hardwood and immediately grabbed at his right hip in pain. He was ultimately helped off the floor and into the tunnel without putting any weight on his right leg by a pair of Thunder staffers. Holmgren has gotten off to a tremendous start to his sophomore campaign, averaging 18.2 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.9 blocks per game coming into Sunday’s contest, asserting himself as a serious threat for DPOY with his work protecting the rim for the league’s best defense so far.  The Thunder will hope Holmgren’s injury was just a painful fall and not something more serious that could lead to an extended absence, as they are already incredibly thin at the center position with Isaiah Hartenstein still out with a fractured hand.  UPDATE: Holmgren was ruled out for the game with what the Thunder officially called a right hip injury. Shams Charania reported later Monday night that Holmgren would miss 8-10 weeks with a hip fracture."

	Giannis played a little prank on Jaylen Brown after catching him with an elbow, but the Celtics star wasn't a big fan of Giannis' antics.","The Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics have had two very different starts to the season, as the defending champs have picked up where they left off with another strong beginning to their repeat bid, while the Bucks have been one of the NBA’s worst teams despite having a healthy Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo.  It has not been the kind of start Milwaukee envisioned, and they were hoping to kickstart a turnaround on Sunday when they played host to the Celtics with a chance to alleviate some of the panic about the team’s start by beating one of the league’s best. As they’ve done on a few occasions this season, the Bucks came out hot, scoring 40 in the first quarter to take a double-digit lead, but couldn’t maintain that offensive output, scoring just 38 in the entire second half to see the Celtics pull ahead and pull away for a 113-107 win.  During the game, Giannis and Jaylen Brown had an interesting exchange, as Antetokounmpo elbowed Brown in the head on a post move and then hit Brown with a fake handshake as they went back down the court, which Brown didn’t seem to appreciate.   A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston)  After the game, Brown gave some brief, but unfiltered thoughts on the exchange. “Giannis is a child,” Brown dead-panned. “I’m just focused on helping my team get a win, and that’s what we did tonight.”  Giannis certainly wasn’t the chief culprit for the Bucks struggles on Sunday, as he had 43 points and 13 rebounds, but this kind of silly exchange doesn’t quite land as well with fans when the team is falling to 2-8 on the season, with the only team worse than them in the East being the Embiid-less Sixers."

	The Chiefs moved to 9-0 after blocking a 35-yard kick by Denver with one second left that would've won the game.","The Kansas City Chiefs entered Sunday as the NFL’s last remaining undefeated team at 8-0, and were heavy favorites to move to 9-0 at home against their divisional rival from Denver. However, the Chiefs offense, which has been sluggish at times this season, could not finish off drives with touchdowns and allowed the Broncos to hang around all game.  On Sunday, it looked like that would finally catch up to them and result in a loss, as the Broncos moved the ball inside the Chiefs 20 on their final drive of the game, trailing 16-14, setting up a 35-yard field goal attempt for the win by Wil Lutz. However, the Chiefs special teams unit still had at least one more miracle in them, as George Karlaftis, Leo Chenal, and company caved in the left side of the Broncos field goal unit and blocked the kick to preserve the 16-14 win.  A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  It’s an insane way for the Chiefs to win that game, as they were completely unable to run the ball (19 carries for 57 yards, 19 yards coming from Patrick Mahomes scrambling), missed a number of big play opportunities and had to settle for field goals, and gave up a critical late game drive deep into their own territory. And yet, they move on to Week 11 at 9-0 on the season with a schedule that isn’t the most difficult if they can get past a road trip to Buffalo next week — although, as Sunday proved, division games can always get weird."
Sports – UPROXX,The Bucks Have ‘Called The Whole League’ Trying To Find A Trade After Their Awful Start,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/milwaukee-bucks-trade-rumors-called-whole-league/,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 22:30:53 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	The Bucks are trying to find a roster upgrade, but with their cap situation, they're finding it nearly impossible despite their best effort.","The Milwaukee Bucks came into the 2024-25 season hopeful that having both Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo fully healthy and coming off a full training camp together would vault them back into being a threat in the Eastern Conference. Instead, the Bucks are 2-6 with their only wins over the tanking Jazz and the Sixers on opening night — who were without Joel Embiid and Paul George and have also looked awful to start the season.  It’s been rough on both sides of the ball for the Bucks, as they are in the bottom half of the league in both offensive and defensive rating through the first few weeks of the season, and while things should improve if and when Khris Middleton can get back healthy for an extended period of time, it’s also pretty clear this roster has some flaws in need of fixing. The problem for the Bucks is, as a second apron team, making a trade is extremely difficult, as they’ve found out the hard way recently.  On Friday’s episode of NBA Today, Brian Windhorst said the Bucks have “called pretty much the whole league” trying to find a trade that could improve their roster, but have run into the same issues with just about everyone.  “The Bucks are doing something that we don’t see very often, which is scouring the trade market in the first week of November,” Windhorst said. “As I was talking to teams this week, they were like, ‘The Bucks just called. The Bucks just called.’ I think the Bucks right now are just kind of searching and trying to cover their bases. And by the way, Giannis is not on the table, Dame is not on the table, they’re looking to try and (find) help for some of their wing play — Khris Middleton’s absence has been extended.  “I talked to one team who said, ‘Yeah, we talked to the Bucks. We came up with two or three different scenarios and realized we’re not allowed to make any of those trades.’ The Bucks are hemmed in as a second-apron team with the new rules. They can’t aggregate players together, they can’t put like two or three players together in a trade. They can’t do a trade where they bring in more money. They have traded away the next six first round picks, either the picks or the swaps, they have traded away the next six second round picks. They are $75 million in the luxury tax. I don’t think help is on the way through the trade market. But they are making calls, which is interesting because from what I can tell, they called pretty much the whole league.” The two players the Bucks were reported to be shopping over the summer (and even last trade deadline) were Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton, but as Windhorst notes, being unable to aggregate those salaries together means they have to find a player to trade for that matches salary exactly or makes just a little less than either of those two. Given Portis makes just over $12.5 million and Connaughton makes just under $9.5 million, that’s a tough thing to do if the goal is to add a strong contributor for a contender. As such, Windy doesn’t expect them to find a miraculous deal out there, and it sounds like, despite the front office’s best efforts in working the phones, it’s going to come down to this roster to turn things around in Milwaukee."

	Come get these winners.","More than half of the 2024 NFL regular season is over. That reality is painful for those enjoy consuming every aspect of professional football and, in this space, things haven’t gone particularly well. In fact, it was largely a disaster for the first seven weeks but, after back-to-back winning performances, optimism is beginning to creep in.  Would it have been better if the Cleveland Browns or Green Bay Packers could’ve taken care of business last week? Certainly. But here we are after a 3-2 showing. Before handing out this week’s selections, let’s take stock as we dig out of the hole.  Come get these winners. I am actually quite high on the Bills dating back to the summer, but I can’t get them to -4 here. Buffalo is riding high with a four-game winning streak, which helps to explain the number, and Indianapolis has flopped with two straight losses. Still, Joe Flacco and company shouldn’t be getting a full four at home, and we have to take the candy. This is just a principle play. We’re taking advantage of a Wong teaser here, sending Pittsburgh through a pair of key numbers and doing the same with Kansas City. The Steelers have been a wagon as an underdog under Mike Tomlin. The Chiefs will eventually lose (I think) but it won’t be here.  As noted a week ago, this credit goes to UPROXX editor Robby Kalland, but NFC South overs are unbeaten this season. Perhaps that will come to an end here, but Atlanta’s offense can put up points in bunches and its defense is capable of letting the Saints hang around. Let’s go touchdowns. I have to admit that I hate this. I know my editors will hate this. But Los Angeles is laying more than a touchdown with a total in the 30’s? It isn’t as if the Chargers have a real home-field advantage either. I’m holding my nose as I type this, but I simply must. New York has been a sharp side all week, and that makes sense. I couldn’t quite give out the Jets in an awesome spot last week, but I think this is a sell-high spot on Arizona after their blowout win over Chicago. Take me there, Aaron Rodgers."

	The new release from ""A Philly Special Christmas Party"" features an unlikely duet between the Hall of Fame center and the legendary singer.","Jason Kelce clearly has some pretty major aspirations for this year’s version of his annual Christmas album. Earlier this month, fans of Kelce’s holiday project with his former Philadelphia Eagles teammates Lane Johnson and Jordan Mailata heard the first track off of their upcoming album A Philly Special Christmas Party, which featured Kelce teaming up with his brother, Travis Kelce, and Boyz II Men on the track “It’s Christmas Time (In Cleveland Heights).” Kelce collaborated with another legendary artist for the latest track off of the upcoming release, as he recorded a duet with Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks. The track, a cover of Ron Sexsmith’s “Maybe This Christmas,” got teased on the project’s Instagram account over the last week and on the latest edition of the Kelce brothers’ podcast, and was officially unveiled on Friday.  A post shared by A Philly Special Christmas (@aphillyspecialchristmas)  “There are no words to describe how incredible it is to have Stevie Nicks on this record,” executive producer Conner Barwin said in a statement given to Rolling Stone. “There is so much emotion in this song, and it was thrilling to be with them in the studio and watch her and Jason connect, be creative together, and witness this beautiful song become a reality.” A Philly Special Christmas Party will come out on Nov. 22, 2024, but if you’d like to listen to the new track, you can do that right here."

	NBA players have been appearing in music videos for years, and today, we highlighted some of the best cameos.","NBA players and musical artists have always been close with one another. One frequent way that we’ve seen that over the years is music videos, as NBA players have frequently made cameos in them, whether they’re just showing their face for a moment or they’re a main character in the story that an artist is trying to tell. Today, we wanted to highlight some of our favorite appearances that NBA players have made in music videos over the years. Players from a number of different eras — and songs from a number of different genres — made it on the list, but all of them feature artists making it a point to get some of the biggest names in basketball into their videos. This wasn’t the only time Kobe linked up with Destiny’s Child — he recorded a verse on a remix of their track “Say My Name.” He does have a cameo in the video for “Bug-a-Boo,” though, as Destiny’s Child — which is trying to get away from a group that is bugging them — dips into a locker room. While going through there, they come across Bryant, who is sitting there and getting ready to play basketball. MJ and MJ just had to appear in a music video together at some point, no? The two appear on a basketball court and shoot hoops with one another, and at one point, Michael (Jackson) teaches Michael (Jordan) some dance moves. These might have been the two most famous people in the world when this video came out in 1992, and it’s a pretty remarkable cultural artifact. The newest release on this list, DeRozan was one of the many celebrities who made a cameo in Lamar’s summer anthem that doubled as the high point of his feud with Drake from earlier this year. It turns out DeRozan has known Lamar for quite some time, and while he said he still has love for Drake despite appearing in this video, well, it sure seems like there might be some tension here. Shaq, as we’ve laid out before, has been in a ton of music videos over the years. His first was the iconic “Make ‘Em Say Uhh!” video, where he sits courtside and looks like he’s having the time of his life as Master P and co. put on a show on the hardwood. One of the biggest music videos of all time — it’s a little more than 14 and a half minutes long, and is absolutely jam packed with some of the biggest names in sports and entertainment at that time. Names like Deion Sanders, Rickey Henderson, and Wayne Gretzky make cameos, while the NBA is well-represented with two members of the Dream Team and, uh, a third player who was almost on the Dream Team. Easily the most … unique video on this list. It features Jimmy Butler dressed up in what I can only describe as an emo cowboy costume and really committing fully to the bit. (The bit, of course, is “Jimmy Butler dressing like this in a Fall Out Boy video.”) There is no one in the NBA quite like Jimmy, and this video is a pretty good example of why that is the case."

	Travis Kelce caught a stray on 'Jeopardy!.'","Travis Kelce has long been one of the NFL’s most visible stars, but recently, he has achieved a new level of widespread cultural notoriety thanks to his relationship with Taylor Swift. Jeopardy! made a nod to that during the November 6 episode. In the episode’s opening round (per J! Archive), the $200 clue in the “The TV Show In Question” category read, “Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? is hosted by this man who’s maybe more famous as a BF than as a 3-time Super Bowl champ.” Contestant Derek Hieronymus correctly responded with Kelce. Here’s a video of the moment. This came shortly after Jeopardy! found itself in a bit of hot water. As USA Today notes, Heather Ryan, a contestant on the October 28 episode, recently spoke out about a clue that read, “Men seldom make passes at…,” with the correct response being, “Girls who wear glasses.” She said, “It is definitely an odd choice. I think it made everybody in the audience and on stage — and Ken Jennings, too — a little uncomfortable. It was like, ‘Oh, that was unexpected.’ Maybe we choose better rhyming phrases in 2024. […] Unfortunately, there are still girls who are (in) middle school, and they don’t want to wear their glasses and they’re losing out on their education. So, I think it’s much better to be able to see than anything else.” Jennings apologized following the incident, saying, “A little problematic, sorry Heather.”"

	Vivek Ranadive has unsurprisingly taken DeMar DeRozan's side in his simmering feud with Drake.","The Toronto Raptors traveled to Sacramento to take on the Kings on Wednesday night in a game that has suddenly given us a little spiciness off the court. Sacramento went to Toronto on the night of Vince Carter’s jersey retirement ceremony last week, which was the first time that DeMar DeRozan played in front of Drake since he appeared in the music video for Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us.” While DeRozan, in the immediate aftermath, said he has tons of love for Drake despite his cameo in the video, Drake expressed that he doesn’t want to see DeRozan get his number retired in Toronto when his career comes to an end, and DeRozan seemed to have a lot of fun responding. And on Wednesday with Drake’s beloved Raptors in town, Kings owner Vivek Ranadive decided to show some support to his star forward by wearing a shirt with the words “THEY NOT LIKE US” on it.  A post shared by SLAM (@slam)  The Kings picked up a 122-107 win on Wednesday to move and 5-3 on the season. All five starters scored in double-figures for Sacramento, with DeRozan leading the way with 27 points on 11-for-21 shooting. It is unclear if he was motivated by the fact that the team’s owner showed up and wore a shirt that trolled Drake, but I’m sure at least part of him appreciated it."

	Windhorst thinks the Warriors have an ""itchy trigger finger"" when it comes to trade talks and chasing another star.","The Golden State Warriors picked up a big early season win on Wednesday night when they defeated the Boston Celtics to improve to 7-1 on the young season and offer an early confirmation point that their hot start is the real deal after beating a number of teams in the middle and bottom of the standings.  The Warriors’ depth has been showcased during their hot start, but this is a team that was very active on the trade market this summer trying to land another star-level player to fit between Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. Paul George and Lauri Markkanen were well known pursuits of the Warriors, and their hot start may only further embolden the front office to go star-chasing during the season.  As Brian Windhorst laid out on Thursday’s First Take, the Warriors are the team he most expects to make a splash trade this season, as they have the contracts, young players, and draft assets to make a competitive offer for just about anyone.  ""The Warriors are the biggest candidate in my mind to make a big trade. They tried to trade for LeBron James last trade deadline… This is a team that's got an itchy trigger finger trying to make a big deal."" – Brian Windhorst 👀pic.twitter.com/0wYql9bYW4 — ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) November 7, 2024  Windhorst notes this front office seems to have an “itchy trigger finger” when it comes to trade talks, noting their efforts at landing another star date back to last deadline when they called the Lakers about LeBron. While a move isn’t imminent and they’ll likely ride this wave of positivity for awhile, by the time 2025 arrives and trade season kicks into full gear, they should be seen as a top threat for any star that comes available. We know the likes of Brandon Ingram and Zach LaVine are still available, but that was the case this summer and the Warriors seemed to balk at making a move for either of those two players. Instead, it seems Golden State is keen to wait to see if someone else comes available they could make a run at, but Windy, at the very least, would be very surprised if this Warriors roster looks the same by mid-February when San Francisco is hosting the All-Star Game."

	We caught up with Mercedes Moné to discuss her return from injury, regaining confidence, and how she's blazing a trail for the AEW women.","The last year has been a whirlwind for Mercedes Moné, and more than six months into her AEW tenure, there’s plenty to be grateful for.  What was once considered a career-ending ankle injury could have sidelined Moné for good, she refused to accept the possibility of her childhood dream being over, instead choosing optimism, and willing herself back into the ring. “It’s really just leading with gratitude, thankful to be a part of this wrestling community still,” Moné tells Uproxx Sports. “The last year was the craziest year of my whole life, not knowing where I was going to be in wrestling, but leading with gratitude and staying positive.” Moné landed in AEW in March, carrying the same mindset she’s had throughout her career as she’s trail blazed a new path for women’s wrestling.  “(I knew) where I wanted to be and what I want to leave in professional wrestling, to take this women’s division to whole new heights all over the world,” Moné says. “I wanted to have more for women’s wrestling, so I knew going to AEW was the place to be to make that happen. I feel like the women’s division has really changed the game. The women’s division has been the best it’s ever been. The women’s storylines are headlining AEW pay-per-views. So it’s just been amazing to come this far and I’m really excited for more.” For most athletes, an injury the severity of Moné’s typically requires at least two years to be back at full strength. She says she feels amazing being back in the ring and admits the toughest part of this journey is in the past.  “For me, it was just mentally going into the ring and training and being like, okay, I don’t want to be scared of climbing the top rope. I don’t want to be scared of jumping off the top rope. I don’t even want to be scared of running, because due to my injury, I couldn’t walk for over three months,” Moné says. “So just telling myself that I still got this. I got to train with Tyler Breeze for three months preparing myself for my AEW debut. And it was just getting my confidence back in the ring. That’s what really took some time. But now I’m feeling better than ever, and here I am as two belts Moné, so I’m feeling great.” After returning to the ring in May, Moné was quick to find gold around her waist. She defeated Willow Nightingale to earn the TBS title before claiming the NJPW STRONG Women’s championship just a month later. After sitting in the stands at All In at Wembley Stadium last year, Moné battled Britt Baker in London this year. She’s continued to find her footing in matches against Hikaru Shida, Emi Sakura, and most recently, Queen Aminata.  Moné isn’t just talking the talk, she’s leading the AEW women’s division to new heights and opening doors to elevate talent across the roster.  “I was born to be the best. I was born to have this purpose of leading a charge of making sure that women’s wrestling is known and respected and it deserves the respect that it’s given,” Moné says. “So just leaning on the standard that I put for myself, I’m here to be the best, to show the world that I’m the best, and I’m here to bring the women along with me. So that’s the goal.” While she has her eyes firmly on her next challenger for the TBS championship, Kris Statlander at the Full Gear pay-per-view on November 23, Moné isn’t stopping at defending the belts already in her possession. Mariah May told me ahead of All In earlier this year that she’s interested in mixing it up down the line with Moné, a dream opponent for the talented AEW Women’s champion. When — and if — that match happens remains to be seen.  Moné is never one to shy away from a challenge and says she’s “coming for all the titles” in AEW, while offering praise for one of the promotion’s brightest young talents. “I am super proud to watch from afar. She came in as a super fan, just loving wrestling, loved it so much that she moved from England to Japan, trained out in Stardom just to hone her craft, and now she’s here,” Moné says.   “She is our women’s world champion, beating Toni Storm in one of the best storylines in women’s history. So to see her rise this fast and to see how good she is in the ring, it’s so incredible. Like I said, we have the best women’s division in the game right now. And I’m definitely looking at the title that she has around her waist.”"

	Morant and the Grizzlies beat the Lakers at home for the first time since their tense playoff series in 2023.","Ja Morant and the Memphis Grizzlies took down the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night. It was the first time that Morant got to play L.A. at home since the two teams went head-to-head in a tense playoff series back in 2023 — Los Angeles won in six games — and Morant sure did play like he still has that postseason failure on his mind. In the 131-114 Grizzlies win, Morant tied for the team high with 20 points, along with five assists, four rebounds, a steal, and a block. At one point, he scored over Gabe Vincent and hit him with a too small … only for LeBron James to come back on the very next possession and get him right back.  Ja Morant gave a ""too small"" to Gabe Vincent, and then LeBron gave it right back to Ja 😅pic.twitter.com/0N3OnwlMu1 — Dime (@DimeUPROXX) November 7, 2024  After the game, Morant spoke to the media, and after saying that James’ too small was done “respectfully,” he expressed that he really does not like the Lakers. “I don’t like ’em,” Morant told the press. “They knocked me out the playoffs … they beat us last time, I didn’t get to play, like I said, last year. They came on our home floor, beat us on our home floor, was laughin’, playin’, lookin’ at me, talkin’. My message was, I was in street clothes. This is my first opportunity to get back on the floor playing against them.” As for the whole “getting a too small for LeBron” thing, well, Morant took to Twitter after the win and addressed that."

	JJ Redick was blunt when asked why his starting guard got benched in the third quarter of Wednesday's loss to the Grizzlies.","The Los Angeles Lakers fell to the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night, 131-114, as they attempt to navigate what has been a pretty difficult spate of injuries. One guy who hasn’t been injured, though, is starting guard D’Angelo Russell, although he saw his minutes cut on Wednesday — Russell came out of the game with 5:54 left in the third quarter, did not reenter, and only played 21:33 on the evening. New Lakers coach JJ Redick decided to close the game with Gabe Vincent on the floor, and after the game, he was asked why he kept Russell on the bench. As he explained, part of it was just wanted to see what Vincent gave him, but with Russell, there were some things that he did not like to see. “Level of compete, attention to detail, some of the things we’ve talked with him about for a couple weeks and, at times, he’s been really good with that stuff, and other times, it’s just reverting back to certain habits,” Redick told the press after the game at the 3:05 mark of the above video. “Wasn’t like a punishment, just felt like for us to have a chance to win this game, that was the route we wanted to take. Gabe, in the first half, especially defensively, was fantastic, and I just wanted to see what that looked like.” Russell went 4-for-12 from the field for 12 points, three assists, and two steals before his evening came to an end."

	Miller had 19 points on the night, with his biggest bucket coming as the clock hit zero.","The Charlotte Hornets are built around a young and exciting 1-2 punch in LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller. On Wednesday night, both of the franchise’s pillars needed to come up big in order for Charlotte to pick up a 108-107 win over the Detroit Pistons, with Miller, in particular, playing the hero in the waning moments of the game. After a turnover by Miller, the Pistons went the other way and got a layup from rookie forward Ron Holland to take a 1-point lead. On the ensuing possession, the Hornets were able to get a good look for Grant Williams, who pulled up from behind the three-point line but was not able to convert. Fortunately for everyone in Charlotte, Miller was able to sneak his way into the lane and clean up the miss. He immediately attempted a layup, which went in and gave the Hornets their third win of the season.  A post shared by SportsCenter (@sportscenter)  It wasn’t the most productive night for Miller, who had 19 points on 6-for-16 shooting with six rebounds and four assists. But he got the biggest two points of the evening, so it’s safe to say that he had a pretty good evening. As for his star running mate, Ball had 25 points, eight assists, six rebounds, and two steals."

But they are determined to make the mogul proud, one up their rivals, and bring the school’s band program into a new era. Though the reaction to the planned performance is mostly love, Mills has gotten a bit of trepidation from alums worried about “protecting certain traditions.” He’s not deterred though, “This yields an opportunity to say ‘Look, I got it.’” Blaze, on the other hand, couldn’t be more excited about the collab. “I’ve been waiting for this moment all my life, and didn’t even realize it until now.” He’s not the only person thoroughly anticipating a great performance. Denise Saunders Thompson, Assistant Dean to the Chadwick Boseman College of Fine Arts, takes time out of her busy schedule to meet Mills, Blaze, and the band on the field to complement and encourage their progress. “Were gonna break the internet with this performance,” she tells the group, hoping to manifest this new standard-setting moment with her words.

	Embiid has not played yet this season, but his suspension will not go into effect until after he is eligible to play.","The Philadelphia 76ers will have to wait a little longer for Joel Embiid to play in his first game this season. On Tuesday afternoon, the NBA announced that Embiid received a 3-game suspension following an incident in the locker room on Saturday night where he shoved a member of the media. It is believed that Embiid shoved Marcus Hayes of the Philadelphia Inquirer, who recently published a column criticizing Embiid over not playing this season that referenced his son and late brother, which upset the former NBA MVP. “Mutual respect is paramount to the relationship between players and media in the NBA,” Joe Dumars, the NBA’s Executive Vice President, Head of Basketball Operations said in a statement. “While we understand Joel was offended by the personal nature of the original version of the reporter’s column, interactions must remain professional on both sides and can never turn physical.” Embiid criticized Hayes earlier in the week during a media availability, but he was not in attendance. In its statement, the league announced that Embiid — who has been working his way back from a knee issue — will not start serving his suspension until he is eligible and healthy enough to play. The Sixers have gotten off to a slow start this season without Embiid, as the team is 1-5. Their high-profile offseason addition, Paul George, only just made his regular season debut on Monday night against the Phoenix Suns after getting hurt in the preseason."

	Lou Williams wasn't a fan of what Drake said about DeMar DeRozan on the night the Raptors retired Vince Carter's jersey.","The Toronto Raptors retired Vince Carter’s jersey last week, the highest honor the team can give to one of the most iconic players in franchise history. The game happened against the Sacramento Kings, which are the current team of someone else who will probably get his jersey retired by the Raptors some day, DeMar DeRozan. While the night was all about Carter, there was some tension between DeRozan and noted Raptors fan Drake, which presumably all revolves around DeRozan appearing in the music video for Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us.” The whole ordeal rubbed former Toronto player Lou Williams the wrong way, which he expressed on FanDuel’s “Run It Back.” “If I’m gonna speak candidly, I thought that was selfish of Drake,” Williams said. “Drake, as well as the country of Canada, the city of Toronto, they know what DeMar DeRozan has contributed to the culture up there, and what he’s contributed to the Toronto Raptors, and to that community. It goes way bigger than his personal relationship with Drake, it goes way bigger than his personal relationship with Kendrick Lamar. So for Drake to say, ‘If you put up a banner and I’ll personally pull it down,’ it’s like, is it just about you or is it about the Toronto Raptors?” Drake expressed during the game that if the Raptors put up a DeRozan banner, “I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.” DeRozan was asked to respond to this after the game and told the press that “He gonna have a long way to climb to take it down. So, tell him good luck.” The following day, DeRozan posted a clip from Friday to his Instagram Story, and it’s not hard to read between the lines that he was talking about Drake."

	Caitlin Clark is excited to play for an Indiana legend, and saw how she had the Sun prepared and thinks that'll make the Fever better.","More than half of the WNBA is changing coaches this offseason, as seven of the league’s 13 teams parted ways with their head coach from the 2024 season — and the Golden State Valkyries are entering the league with a new coach as an expansion franchise. Among the teams that fired their coach after the season was the Indiana Fever, as they let Christie Sides go after guiding Indiana to a second-half push that saw them nab a playoff berth before a first round loss.  The Fever figured to be a highly coveted job as it provides an opportunity to coach the last two Rookie of the Year winners in Caitlin Clark and Aliyah Boston. On Monday, the team officially introduced Stephanie White as their head coach, after White parted ways with the Connecticut Sun to return home to Indiana to take the Fever job for the second time in her career. This time, White takes over a roster that has a ton of talent, and in her intro presser she stated her belief that Clark and Boston can be the best guard-big tandem the WNBA has ever seen.  Those two were at White’s introductory presser, and spoke with ESPN’s Michael Voepel about their excitement to play for White, with Clark explaining that the detailed approach the Sun always had in facing the Fever makes her believe White can help them improve some of their weaknesses quickly.  “We know how much of a legend she is in Indiana,” Clark said Monday. “I think that’s really cool. Playing against her, I would say I felt like her teams always had the best scouts against us. I think that just speaks to her knowledge of the game and her way to analyze, and she clearly was on to something. Hopefully, in turn, now that she knows how to stop us, that should be a good way to know how to [help us] beat certain things as well.” Boston added, “There’s nothing better than playing for a coach that you can already tell she’s going to pour into us. She knows the talent that we have and I’m super-excited to get out on the court. You can feel the intensity already.” White will have the next six months to self-scout the Fever and identify the areas they can improve for 2025, as the expectations will only get bigger for Indiana. At the very least, White believes her young star duo is only scratching the surface and if Clark and Boston can level up in 2025 together, Indiana will have a chance to be a real threat to the WNBA’s top-4."

	Ja Morant hit a wild 360 layup against the Nets and decided to do it again later just for fun.","With Ja Morant missing almost all of last season due to suspension and injury (playing just 9 games), he found himself a bit outside the conversation for top point guards in the NBA coming into the 2024-25 season. It was a lost season for both Morant and the Grizzlies last year, and both player and team are looking to remind the NBA of their talents early this season.  While it’s been an up-and-down start to the year, Morant has offered reminders of his unique brilliance with highlight reel plays that only he produces right now in the NBA. On Monday night in Brooklyn he offered up a pair of outrageous finishes as he was strong on the B-button with two 360 layups against the Nets. The first came on a drive against Nic Claxton, where Morant jumped in the air and spun all the way across the lane for a silky finish with his left. The second was even more spontaneous, as Morant went up thinking about a poster dunk on Cam Johnson before changing his mind for another spinning lefty layup, changing hands in mid-air.  A post shared by NBA (@nba)   A post shared by NBA México (@nbamex)  It’s a pair of plays that perfectly encapsulate Morant’s singular ability as a high-flying guard. The first is so smooth as he just glides effortlessly through the air, while the second started with him thinking power but he had the time and ability to change his plan (and hands) mid-flight for the finish."

	The former teammates crossed paths in a pretty tense way on Monday night.","The Golden State Warriors traveled to Washington to take on the Wizards on Monday night, which meant that the Warriors crossed paths with an old friend, Jordan Poole. An important part of the team’s last title, Poole was traded to the Wizards last season in the aftermath of a tumultuous year with the Dubs. During Monday night’s game, the player responsibility for all that turmoil crossed paths with Poole once again, as the high-scoring guard had a run-in with Draymond Green. Poole knocked down a triple in the waning moments of the second quarter as Green attempted to contest his shot, and after it went in, he pointed right at Green. On the ensuing Warriors possession before the half, Steph Curry knocked down a three — Poole tried to contest it, he was unsuccessful, and Green immediately pointed right at him.   A post shared by SportsCenter (@sportscenter)  During training camp ahead of the 2022-23 season, Poole and Green were involved in an altercation during practice that ended with Green punching his then-teammate. Green received a suspension and a fine from the team as a result. While Poole received a 4-year, $140 million contract extension from the team not long after this, he really struggled during the ensuing season, and the following summer, he was sent to Washington in a trade for Chris Paul."

Kelce is on ESPN’s Monday Night Countdown now and has a wildly popular podcast with his brother Travis, as the brothers have seen their stardom leap from the sports world to pop culture in general, due in no small part to Travis’ relationship with Taylor Swift that has brought her legions of fans to them.

On Saturday, Jason was reminded of that when he was in State College for Ohio State-Penn State and had a heckler call Travis a gay slur for dating Swift while holding his phone out recording. That jackass was seeking a reaction and got one in the form of Jason grabbing his phone and spiking it on the ground, with videos from other nearby going viral immediately.  On Monday night, Kelce addressed the incident at the top of Monday Night Countdown and issued an apology, noting that’s not how he wants to act and that he doesn’t want to “greet hate with hate.” Jason Kelce opens ""Monday Night Countdown"" with an apology.

	Stephen A. went on a lengthy rant wondering who is allowed to criticize Kevin Durant.","Kevin Durant and Stephen A. Smith aren’t exactly on the best term, as the Suns star has taken exception to some of Smith’s reporting and pontificating for years. Most recently, Durant expressed his frustration with Smith claiming he isn’t a good leader.  Smith reported this summer that the Suns wanted out of Durant amid rumors the Rockets were pursuing the star in a trade. The Sun’s then denied that publicly and as the 2024-25 season began, Durant was in a Phoenix uniform. Still, Smith continued to prod at the star, calling him out for a lack of vocal leadership and being an aloof star in the locker room. Durant responded on Twitter (as he often does) and then again this weekend when asked about the leadership talk by The Athletic’s Doug Haller.  Durant questioned why anyone listens to Stephen A., calling him “a clown” and calling into question his sources, noting he’s never in practices or the locker room. Unsurprisingly, Smith responded on Monday morning on ‘First Take’ with a lengthy diatribe where he said he wouldn’t respond with the same “kind of pettiness and childishness” and questioned who is allowed to talk about Durant, listing off all the people KD has taken issue with (watch here).  “I got bad news for Kevin Durant, if you’re expecting me to reciprocate with that kind of pettiness and childishness, it’s not gonna happen,” Smith said. “Kevin Durant is one of the greatest players to ever play this game. He’s a future Hall of Famer, he’s a two-time champion, two-time Finals MVP, and I’ve been on the record saying he’s also a good dude. So if he wants to resort to that level, even though we’re both grown men and if he had something to say he knows my number and he refrains from doing so, that’s something he has to live with.  “Having said all of that, respectfully, Kevin Durant can you stop lying, please? I’ve been an NBA reporter and I was a columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer as well. Kevin Durant has seen me in the locker room when he was at Oklahoma City. He has seen me in the locker room when he was at Golden State. He has certainly seen me at games throughout his career. But, unfortunately for him, I don’t have to be at shootaround and I don’t have to be in the postgame locker room. I happen to have a hit show that’s been No. 1 for 12 years, I have other things to do with my time. I go to games all the time. I’m not a beat writer anymore.  “The other thing I would say is this, Kevin Durant is going to have to answer this question: Who is allowed to talk about him? Charles Barkley played this game as a Hall of Famer. He got at Charles Barkley. Shannon Sharpe is a Super Bowl champion and a Hall of Famer. He got at Shannon. He got at players, the CJ McCollums of the world, the Dennis Schroders of the world, and others. He’s gotten at fans, and did it discreetly because he had accounts that didn’t reveal who he was. It’s contemporaries and colleagues, it’s former players, it’s present players, it’s the media, it’s fans, it’s whoever. Is anyone allowed to talk about Kevin Durant? Because I don’t understand it. I don’t get it.” The “he can call me” thing from Stephen A. is always funny to me, because it implies that only he is allowed to talk about people in front of a microphone and if they want to discuss him and his commentary they should do it privately. His final point is probably his strongest, as he notes that Durant has bristled at comments from fellow players, former greats, and all manner of media members and fans. It’s a fair point, and his use of burner accounts in the past has, in particular, left a reputation of Durant having thin skin. That said, at this point, KD happily replies to folks from main, and I think his directness in responding to people — whether it’s Barkley, Smith, or some random Twitter account — breaks down the wall that typically exists in the athlete-critic relationship.  Most athletes either ignore it or internalize it for motivation, but rarely do they so regularly respond and push back on it directly. Athletes love to prove doubters or haters wrong, but they typically throw everyone into one bucket and respond generally. Durant, meanwhile, takes a very different approach by responding directly and asking for critics to elaborate or explain their reasoning further. That tends to throw folks off, including Smith. There is certainly fair criticism to be made about Durant, but I also don’t think it’s unreasonable for him to push back if he doesn’t believe it."

Today (November 3), Ella Mai reappeared online to announce her surprise EP, 3, to celebrate her birthday.  “AVAILABLE NOW EVERYWHERE! My 30th birthday gift to you all. 3 songs. November 3rd. one of my favorite numbers I’ve missed you all, three times over ❤️,” she wrote in the Instagram post’s caption. With striking photo of Ella’s profile against an emerald green backdrop, she also revealed some new ink. Behind Ella’s ear you can see her latest tattoo of the number 3. Immediately fans of Ella Mai’s NBA Champion boyfriend and father of her child, Jayson Tatum’s matching body art (viewable here).  After listening to the project, supporters believe 3 is a lover letter to Tatum. On the track “Little Things,” Ella sings: “Be right hеre when you’re wakin’ up / Breakfast on the table, know you like / Eggs, and they’re all scrambled up / Pancakes, bacon, OJ on the side / Packed your bag with extra clothes, your toothbrush in the Louis tote / Love notes for when you on the road / Cleaned your watch and Cuban links / Silk pillowcase for you to take / Boy, you deserve the little things.” The line hints at Tatum’s demanding sports schedule with the Boston Celtics. This heartfelt fluttering can also be heard on “One Of Those,” where Ella sings: “Girl you better get you one of these / Wake up in the morning, he got flowers at my feet / Get one of these, yeah, I don’t wanna leave / Dancing ’round him got me like a puppet / I’ma let him pull my strings / Get you one of these / Kinda man that get you what you want, then he gon’ give you want you need / I’m just saying get you one of these.” Continue below to view Ella Mai’s 3 tracklist and cover. 1. “Hearts On Deck”

	Barkley spun to break one tackle and then hurdled a defender while facing the other way in an insane run on Sunday.","Hurdling an opponent is one of the great risk-reward moves a ball-carrier can make, as going airborne to avoid a tackle can lead to a huge play but also can result in a player getting absolutely blasted. Some players are much better at it than others, and Saquon Barkley is among the best in all of football at leaping defenders, going all the way back to his college days at Penn State.  On Sunday, the star running back decided to innovate on his trademark move one one of the greatest 14-yard runs you’ll ever see, where he broke out a spin move into what I can only describe as a reverse hurdle, as he leaped over a defender while facing the opposite direction.  THE 180 HURDLE??? DID SAQUON JUST INVENT THIS?! 📺: #JAXvsPHI on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/tYThjnbdgG — NFL (@NFL) November 3, 2024  I really don’t know how you pull this off without injuring yourself or fumbling, but Barkley cleared the defender cleanly and landed on his feet — before taking a shot from another defender and needing to check out for a play or two. Tiki Barber in the FOX booth rightfully loses his mind over this move, and I really hope no young running backs look at this and decide they want to replicate it because it would go extremely poorly for anyone without Barkley’s insane athleticism."

	KD called out Stephen A. Smith for being ""a clown"" and isn't sure why people still listen to him.","The Phoenix Suns picked up their fourth straight win on Saturday night in Portland, improving to 5-1 on the young season to remain tied for second in the West with the Warriors, a game back of the NBA’s last remaining undefeated team, Oklahoma City.  It’s the second season for the Suns star trio being all together, and that has, historically, been when those teams take a leap if they ever do. The first year is figuring out how it all should work and learning how not to step on each other’s toes, and then the second year is when we find out if the ceiling really is as high as it appears on paper. For that reason, the strong start to this season is a very good sign for the Suns, even if there’s still a long way to go this season in confirming their status as a top threat in the West.  An additional subplot to this Suns season is that of Kevin Durant’s reputation, as the future Hall of Famer still gets nagged about whether he’s an effective leader, largely because his greatest team success came when he joined the Warriors where it was clearly Stephen Curry’s team. Charles Barkley has prodded at KD pretty consistently, calling him a follower and bus rider, while Stephen A. Smith regularly takes aim at Durant’s leadership as the thing he lacks compared to other top stars of his generation.  Durant and his Suns teammates and coaches have scoffed at that notion, and on Saturday night Durant was again asked the leadership question by Doug Haller of The Athletic and had some pointed words for Stephen A., calling him “a clown.”  “Yeah, Stephen A., I don’t understand how people even listen to Stephen A.,” he told The Athletic. “I’ve been in the league for 18 years. I’ve never seen Stephen A. at a practice, or a film session, or a shoot-around. I’ve never seen him anywhere but on TV talking s— about players. … He’s a clown to me. He’s always been a clown. You can write that, too.” Durant went on to note that he isn’t taking a different approach or trying to be more vocal this year, insisting that he’s going about his business as always. He bristled, in particular, at commentary from the likes of Smith that he is aloof and distant from his teammates, which his Suns teammates push back on as well when asked by Haller. “To say that I’m just sitting here, you paint this picture of me coming into the locker room, not talking to my teammates, quiet, not talking to my coaches,” Durant said. “Like, come on, man. It’s just ridiculous.” Durant is far from the only NBA star who gets frustrated by Smith’s commentary and, particularly, when he offers up sourced reporting despite not being on the ground covering the league on the road regularly. Smith certainly knows a ton of people in and around the league, but players and fans are constantly skeptical of what he says, largely because it often feels his opinion and any reporting get blended together all into one. That makes it tough to separate the two, especially because he can’t help but go over the top with how he presents things. Durant has voiced his annoyance with Smith in the past, but this is some of his firmest criticism that hasn’t been levied on Twitter."

	Drake also hurled insults at DeRozan during the game's broadcast.","You may have moved past Kendrick Lamar’s chart-topping Drake diss, “Not Like Like Us.” But Drake surely hasn’t. After Akademiks dispelled rumors of a reconciliation between Drake and Future, the “First Person Shooter” rapper attempted to flex his star power against another foe.  Yesterday (November 2), Drake attended the Toronto Raptors and the Sacramento Kings game at Scotiabank Arena. Instead of focusing on the friendly matchup, Drake and his longtime friend Nessel “Chubbs” Beezer decided to laser in on former Raptors star DeMar DeRozan (now the the Kings). Throughout the game, Drake could be heard hurling remarks at DeRozan (supposedly including “p*ssy” and “goof“), and it doesn’t seem to be sports related tension.  At one point, Drake and Chubbs (both courtside) can be seen standing up and staring down DeRozan (viewable here). Well, just as viewers at home caught the suspenseful moment, so did DeRozan. Over on Instagram, DeMar DeRozan decided to troll Drake back by posting a video clip from Friday (viewable here).  In the scene, starring Ice Cube (playing Craig) and Chris Tucker (playing Smokey), Tucker’s character attempts to regain tough points after being punked by the neighborhood bully, Deebo (played by the late Tommy Lister). “I got mind control over Deebo,” says Tucker. “He be like shut the f*ck up. I be quiet. But when he leaves I be talking again.” This comes after Drake vowed to “pull down” DeRozan’s number should the Raptors ever decide to retire it after Vincent Carter’s number retirement celebration. DeRozan claimed that he and Drake were “still family” even after he appeared in the “Not Like Us” music video. However, it appears Drake doesn’t feel that same."

	DeRozan, of course, was in Kendrick Lamar's ""Not Like Us"" video, which surely had nothing to do with any of this!","It was a night for celebration in Toronto, as the Raptors retired the iconic number 15 worn by Vince Carter. And to put a cherry on top of what was a joyous evening in the 6, the Raptors were able to pick up a thrilling, 131-128 win over the Sacramento Kings in overtime, thanks to a 31-point outing by RJ Barrett. Playing the Kings meant that another Toronto legend, DeMar DeRozan, was back in town. Drake, unsurprisingly, was also there, which set up a pretty funny back-and-forth. While sitting in the broadcast booth, Drake expressed that he does not want DeRozan to get a banner, saying “If you ever put a DeRozan banner up, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.” Now, it’s unclear if this is serious or a joke, but it’s worth remembering that DeRozan was in the music video for Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” and appeared on stage at The Pop Out while Lamar performed the song at the height of his feud with Drake earlier this year. And after the game, DeRozan got asked about Drake’s comments and had a simple response before getting up and walking away. “He gonna have a long way to climb to take it down,” DeRozan said. “So, tell him good luck.” It’s worth mentioning that when DeRozan was asked about the Drake-Kendrick feud, he said that “Drake’s still my man, still my man, none of it changed.” We’ll be sure to let you know if all of this tonight was in good fun or if things have changed between these two."

	The incident happened after Philly fell to the Grizzlies on Saturday night to move to 1-4 on the year, with Embiid not playing in the game.","The Philadelphia 76ers fell to 1-4 on the regular season on Saturday night, as the team picked up a 124-107 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. As has been the case every time they’ve taken the floor this year, the Sixers were without the services of Joel Embiid, who is ramping up following an issue the team discovered in his left knee. But despite not taking the floor, Embiid was involved in an incident after the game. According to Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer, Embiid “assaulted a reporter in the locker room.” There wasn’t a ton of information in the aftermath, but eventually, Shams Charania of ESPN reported that Embiid got into it with the person who wrote “a recent column that referenced his late brother,” which featured a shove but no punch. Earlier this week, Embiid spoke with the media in Philly and got uncharacteristically fired up, saying “When I see people saying he doesn’t want to play. I’ve done way too much for this city, putting myself at risk for people to be saying that. So, I do think it’s bullsh*t.” In particular, he called out “that dude, he’s not here, Marcus, whatever his name is,” a reference to Pompey’s colleague, Marcus Hayes. Presumably, the reporter Embiid got into it with is Hayes, who wrote a column in October titled “Joel Embiid disrespects the Sixers, the game, its greats, and himself. Shaquille O’Neal and Charles Barkley are right to rip him.” While the piece has since been edited to remove the references to Embiid’s son and late brother, you can read what it originally said here. UPDATE: Kyle Neubeck of PHLY Sports spoke about the altercation on the PHLY Sixers Postgame Show and explained how the altercation came about, with Embiid telling Hayes not to mention his family, before the two went back and forth for nearly two minutes with Embiid eventually shoving Hayes. Per Neubeck, Sixers security staff and players stepped in quickly."

	Goldberg announced he'll have one last match in 2025.","Goldberg is finally going to get his sendoff match in the WWE, he announced on Saturday morning ahead of Georgia-Florida. 🚨 BREAKING: @Goldberg just announced that his retirement match will take place NEXT YEAR! 👀 🎥: @SECNetwork pic.twitter.com/e5KtwfOGnY — WWE (@WWE) November 2, 2024  Goldberg’s return to the WWE comes after he was confronted by World Heavyweight Champion, Gunther, at last month’s Bad Blood live event. Gunther downplayed Goldberg’s wrestling ability, then told his son he hopes he was a better father than he was a wrestler. This caused Goldberg to jump the barricade and go after Gunther before security intervened. While Sami Zayn successfully attacked the champ, Goldberg made his way into the ring and told the camera, “You’re next.” During the Bad Blood press conference, we asked Triple H about the possibility of seeing Goldberg wrestling another match in WWE, after the former world champion has been quite vocal about his desire to have a retirement match. “Atlanta loves Bill Goldberg, and that’s why he was here tonight. He was with his wife and his son, always going to get a huge reaction here enjoying the show,” Triple H said at the time. “Things get said. I can tell you when Bill came back, he was not too happy with Gunther and we’ll see. The further you go, time catches up with all of us. The further you go, the talks get further and further away from reality. But I don’t know, I saw Bill earlier in the day and it was great. And I saw Bill later in the day, and there was a different look on his face and a spark in his eye. So I would say never say never.” Goldberg last wrestled at the Elimination Chamber in 2022 against Roman Reigns. There’s no current word on the time, date, or location of Goldberg’s final match. It will, however, seemingly coincide with John Cena’s retirement tour."

	User online are slamming the unidentified person for using a homophobic slur.","Next to a parent’s love, the bond of siblings is also nearly unbreakable. Today (November 2), one person learned this lesson the hard way. In a now viral video, Jason Kelce came face-to-face with a troll. Given that the former Super Bowl champion announced his retirement in March, the hate wasn’t exactly aimed at him. Outside of the Ohio State Buckeyes and Penn State Nittany Lions’ game, Jason was surrounded by fans. As many hoped to snag a selfie with the former professional footballer, one person can he heard hurling insults at Jason about his brother Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s budding romance. In the video captured by an onlooker, the person yells, “How does it feel that your brother’s a f****t for dating Taylor Swift?” Shocked by the use of the homophobic slur, the filmer lowered their camera. Once the camera panned back up (viewable here courtesy of Pop Crave), you can see Jason slamming a cell phone to the ground.  Now, users online have jumped to Jason’s defense. “Jason is so real for this… no brother would hear such remarks against his own brother and his gf btw,” wrote one user. “We need more men like him,” penned another. “Oh, he put him in his place real quick, King 👑,” chimed another. “That’s disgusting and unacceptable behavior. No one deserves to be harassed or insulted like that,” added another. In the past, Jason has expressed his fondness of his brother Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s relationship after spilling the beans."

	Braun dunked all over Gobert then celebrated, which Gobert did not like.","Christian Braun is maybe the most interesting player on the Denver Nuggets not named Nikola Jokic. Braun, the third-year wing out of Kansas, has been a nice player up to this point in his NBA career, but has to step into a much bigger role after the team decided to not bring back Kentavious Caldwell-Pope in free agency. While he’s still young and a work in progress, the flashes Braun has shown have been awfully fun. Our latest glimpse of that came on Friday night in the Western Conference Semifinals rematch between Denver and the Minnesota Timberwolves, as Braun got met at the rim by Rudy Gobert and just did not care, as he went over and through the linchpin of the Timberwolves defense for a ridiculous dunk.   A post shared by NBA (@nba)  As you can see in the full clip that the NBA unsurprisingly did not want to put on its social media channels, Gobert was not exactly a fan of how Braun celebrated — it did not look like he was trying to scream in Gobert’s face, more that he was fired up in the exact wrong spot. It led to some pretty aggressive pushing and shoving, but ultimately, Braun and Gobert were the only players to receive any sort of reprimand from the referees, as they were each hit with technical fouls. Unfortunately for Braun and the Nuggets, Gobert and co. would get the last laugh, as Minnesota picked up a 119-116 win."

	The former teammates were at he center of a tense moment during Friday's Celtics-Hornets game.","Grant Williams spent the first four years of his NBA career as teammates with Jayson Tatum on the Boston Celtics. He’s moved around a few times since he left the team, and on Friday night, Williams and the Charlotte Hornets played host to his old squad. He did not, however, see the end of the game, as Williams was ejected after committing a Flagrant 2 foul on Tatum. Late in the fourth quarter with the Celtics up, 114-105, Tatum reeled in a rebound and took off down the floor. While that happened, Williams came in and gave him a hip check near mid-court, which sent both of them to the ground.  A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston)  Tatum got right up and walked away from it, but another one of Williams’ former teammates in Boston, Jaylen Brown, made it a point to get in his face and say something while he was being helped up. After it was reviewed, the officials determined that Williams “accelerates, makes significant impact to the dribbler — a non-basketball play, potential for injury,” and as a result, the foul was upgraded to a Flagrant 2. It’s hard to tell exactly why Williams did this, but our hunch is after the game, he’s going to say it had something to do with the rebound Tatum grabbed right before this. You can see it at the very start of the above video, but presumably, he thought Tatum extended his arm and had LaMelo Ball hit the deck. Either that, or he just really wanted to hip check his old teammate. The Celtics went on to win, 124-109."

	All eyes are on Happy Valley for a showdown at the top of the Big Ten.","November is coming in with a bang. It’s the best month of the college football season because of its unparalleled ability to separate the wheat from the chaff in the sport, to determine which teams are real contenders to compete for conference and national titles, and which ones are unable to turn up when the pressure becomes a little more real. Week 10 doesn’t exactly give us a jam-packed slate of games, but think of it like a really fun UFC fight nit. There is a ton on the undercard — a bunch of games that should be close and will keep you flipping back and forth. There’s the co-main event that should be really good, a matchup between a pair of fun ranked team. But everything this week is going to revolve the heavyweight fight at the top of the card, which you can read about right, well, right now. The Nittany Lion fan who co-writes this every week is, in the immortal words of that kid in Christmas Vacation, sh*tting bricks. Penn State hasn’t beaten Ohio State since that famous 2016 game where they won on a blocked field goal return for a touchdown, and since then, you can make the argument that no team (outside of Michigan the last few years) has played the Buckeyes as consistently well as James Franklin’s team. But close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, and Ohio State is on a 7-game winning streak over their Big Ten foes. Both teams have elite defenses — by SP+, the Buckeyes are No. 1 and the Nittany Lions are No. 3 in the country on that side of the football. They’re both rock solid and don’t really have a fatal flaw, although Penn State really does need to start turning its high pressure rate into sacks at some point. What this game is going to come down to, in all likelihood, is how each team overcomes potentially gigantic injuries to key parts of their offenses. For the Buckeyes, this involves their offensive line, as standout left tackle Josh Simmons is out for the year and his replacement, Zen Michalski, struggled against Nebraska before leaving with an injury that Ryan Day thinks will keep him out on Saturday. The reshuffling up front is going to be a major challenge, particularly against standout edge rusher Abdul Carter. But Penn State might have a bigger issue on its hands with an injury to starting QB Drew Allar, an Ohio native who was a disaster in Columbus last year and looked like he was primed for a monster game against his childhood team this season. Allar appeared to hurt his knee against Wisconsin last week, and while he’s a game-time decision who reports indicate will play, his backup, Beau Pribula, was able to lead a comeback in Camp Randall while he was out. Pribula is a totally different QB — Allar is a pure pocket passer, Pribula is a dual-threat — and when he was in, the Nittany Lion rushing attack took off against the Badgers. He’s not on Allar’s level as a passer, though, and to beat the Buckeyes, you have to be able to throw the ball down the field.  The margins have been awfully tight in this game over the years, and there’s no reason to think that won’t be the case again this time around. Will Day be able to get the sort of win over a top-5 team his critics think he can’t, or will Franklin be able to finally slay one of the Big Ten’s giants as he tries to secure the Nittany Lions’ spot as one of the nation’s elite? Big week for things in Pennsylvania, eh? Pitt is coming off of maybe the weirdest win of all time, a 41-13 drubbing of Syracuse where they were outgained, 327-217, but forced five interceptions and turned three of them into pick sixes. They keep finding ways to win, whether it’s behind talented young QB Eli Holstein, a physical running game led by Desmond Reid, a defense that is very good at generating havoc plays, or the top special teams unit in the country based on SP+. SMU, however, will be their toughest test by some margin, especially because dynamic signal caller Kevin Jennings was cleared to play despite an injury. When he is in, the Mustangs love to put the ball in the air and generate big plays, and how they manage to do that against a talented and opportunistic Panther secondary might end up deciding a game that has serious aspirations at the top of the ACC, which I did not expect to say about the game between Pitt and SMU at the start of the year. Is this game going to be good? Probably not. Does it have the potential to be a completely insane matchup of two teams smashed in the middle of the Big 12 that could really use a win? Absolutely. TCU quarterback Josh Hoover is capable of absolutely lighting teams up. Baylor is capable of running all over you with one of their five dudes who have at least 100 rushing yards this year. The Horned Frogs aren’t great at stopping the run, the Bears could be better at stopping teams from passing. If you like points, watch this one. Listen, Miami is going to win in all likelihood — they’re just way more talented than Duke, which has done an admirable job gutting out wins this year, in fairness. However, if Miami’s ACC title hopes take a big hit because they lose to Manny Diaz, we are going to see a gigantic meltdown out of Canes fans. Auburn beat Kentucky last week, 24-10. The Wildcats had 224 yards of total offense. Hunter, on his own, ran for 278 yards. It’s really hard to carry the ball 23 times and average 12.1 yards per carry, but Hunter did just that — plus he found the end zone twice, which is again more than Kentucky did. This line feels like an overreaction to Illinois getting outclassed by the best of the Big Ten while Minnesota has been beating a few mediocre Big Ten teams. The Illini getting points at home against a team that is a much more comfortable caliber of opponent should bring their offense back to life a bit, and I think their defense will look much faster and better against this Minnesota offense compared to Oregon. I like Illinois to win this on the field, but will also happily take three points."

	Embiid is apparently very unhappy with the discourse around his inability to play to start the season.","The Philadelphia 76ers haven’t had Joel Embiid to start the 2024-25 NBA season. Embiid missed all of the preseason, and when the first game of the year rolled around, the team said he was out with “left knee management” — the Sixers star dealt with left knee issues that limited him to only 39 games last season, and while he was able to play in the Olympics, he hasn’t taken the floor since. It’s led to Embiid getting a ton of criticism. Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal both hit him pretty hard on TNT, while one column by a local reporter — titled “Joel Embiid disrespects the Sixers, the game, its greats, and himself. Shaquille O’Neal and Charles Barkley are right to rip him.” — seemed to especially rub him the wrong way, which he made clear while speaking to the media on Friday. “It was never decided,” Embiid told the press when asked when it was decided that he’d slow play his debut this year. “Like I said, everybody has been on the same page. If your body doesn’t react well, and if your body tells you one thing — I’ve done it. From what I can tell you, I’ve broken my face twice, I came back early with the risk of losing my vision, I’ve had broken fingers, I still came back. So, I’m not gonna sit here and be like … When I see people saying he doesn’t want to play. I’ve done way too much for this city, putting myself at risk for people to be saying that. So, I do think it’s bullsh*t. Like that dude, he’s not here, Marcus, whatever his name is, I’ve done way too much for this f*cking city to be treated like this. Done way too f*cking much. “But, like I said, I wish I was as lucky as other ones, but that doesn’t mean that I’m not doing whatever it takes to be out there, which I’m gonna be here pretty soon.” Earlier this week, the NBA fined the Sixers $100,000 for how it approached the Embiid injury situation."

	Come get these winners.","Week 9 of the NFL season is here, and that means the halfway point of the campaign has arrived. Eight weeks are in the books. Eight weeks are still to come. And here we are in the middle. In this space, the first half of the season was not at all kind on the whole, but we did post a winning record in Week 8. Perhaps that is a sign of things to come. At least I will tell myself that until Week 9. Before getting to the five-pack of selections, let’s take stock.  Come get these winners. We’re going back to the Jameis train after an outright win a week ago. I do like the Browns as a standalone investment at +1.5, but the teaser is even more appealing against a low-octane Chargers offense in a game with a very modest total. On the other side, the Bengals burned us a week ago, but this is a good spot for Cincinnati at home in what amounts to a virtual must-win. This is a tail of UPROXX colleague and editor Robby Kalland and I like it quite a bit. NFC South overs might be a principle until it falls off, and Carolina’s defense is just as bad as it seems to be. Take us there, Derek Carr. The Eagles have won three in a row and all is right with the world again, right? Well, I don’t quite buy it yet. Jacksonville isn’t very good, which I will acknowledge, but the Jags have played at a much higher level in recent weeks, including in Week 8 against Green Bay. I like this above 7. In the interest of transparency, I nabbed this at 3 earlier in the week, but that line is gone now outside of opportunities to buy the half-point. Alas, I still like it at 2.5. Detroit has the best point differential in the league and things are rolling, but I’m a bit skeptical of the Lions defensively right now and, perhaps more importantly, this is the first trip outdoors for Jared Goff and the offense this season. The Bucs are very banged-up, which is part of why this line is where it is. With that said, I think Tampa Bay is the side against a Chiefs offense that is still figuring things out. Kansas City is unbeaten and rightly so, but the Chiefs haven’t exactly dominated from an ATS perspective when laying more than a touchdown. We were right against them in Week 8. Going back to the well here."

	Wemby recorded the second 5x5 game in just his 79th career game, making a bit of NBA history in the process.","Victor Wembanyama played in his 79th career NBA game on Thursday night in Utah, as the Spurs came back from an early 11-point deficit to blowout the Jazz, 106-88. Last year’s Rookie of the Year led the way on both ends of the floor for San Antonio as he often does, and he made a bit of NBA history along the way.  For the second time in his young career, the 20-year-old Frenchman posted a 5×5 performance, with 29 points, 10 rebounds, six assists, five steals, and five blocks, and in doing so, he became just the third player in NBA history to record multiple 5×5 games in his career, alongside Hakeem Olajuwon (6) and Andrei Kirilenko (3). 🚨Victor Wembanyama with an UNREAL 5×5 night 🚨 🔥25 Points🔥9 Rebounds🔥7 Assists🔥5 Steals🔥5 Blocks pic.twitter.com/hYXbfSWR4e — NBA TV (@NBATV) November 1, 2024  To be third all-time in anything in the NBA at 20 years old is insane, and he certainly has set a pace where he figures to obliterate Olajuwon’s record of 5×5 performances. Given that Olajuwon is one of the all-time great two-way players, that’s pretty terrific company for Wemby — and Kirilenko is one of those guys that was perhaps a bit ahead of his time as a do-it-all wing. What’s still terrifying is that Wembanyama is still figuring a lot of things out at the NBA level, particularly how to consistently reach his ceiling offensively given he’s already one of the league’s best defensively. Once he gets comfortable with where his spots are on the court and starts to trim the fat, so to speak, with his shot diet and pick up the efficiency on that end, there’s just not going to be anything you can really do with him."

	The catch drew immediate comparisons to Odell Beckham Jr.'s famous catch against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014.","For all the questions that surround the New York Jets right now, one thing that is pretty clear is that the team’s top receivers are capable of doing some incredible things. Davante Adams has been a monster throughout his NFL career, while Garrett Wilson is one of the brightest young stars at the position in the league. And on Thursday night when the Jets desperately needed one of their two standouts on the outside to make a player, he answered with a catch that drew immediate comparisons to Odell Beckham Jr.’s famous catch against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. On third-and-19 from deep in Houston Texans territory, Aaron Rodgers looked Wilson’s way and fired towards the back of the end zone. Wilson went up against Kamari Lassiter, created a little separation, and plucked the ball out of the air with one hand. Unfortunately for him, it looked like he only got one foot down, but then, replay stepped in.  (after review) HOLY ONE-HAND GARRETT FREAKING WILSON TOUCHDOOOOOWN❕❕❕#HOUvsNYJ on @NFLonPrime pic.twitter.com/htLVwK7TA6 — New York Jets (@nyjets) November 1, 2024  When this was slowed down, it was determined that Wilson’s left shin landed inbounds before his knee landed out of bounds, which meant that he was considered in and scored a touchdown. The Jets really needed this, as it put them ahead of the Texans in a game they absolutely have to win if they want to keep their playoff hopes alive, but more importantly, everyone who saw it got to say that they witnessed one of the greatest one-handed snags in NFL history on a night when the Jets also did this."

	Banchero will be evaluated in 4-6 weeks.","Paolo Banchero has been spectacular to start the 2024-25 NBA season. The former No. 1 overall pick has looked like the face of the franchise the Orlando Magic have sought for years, which included a 50-point outing in a win over the Indiana Pacers earlier this week. Unfortunately for the Magic, they’ll have to navigate at least the next month without their star forward. In a bit of news announced by Shams Charania of ESPN that the team confirmed not long after, Banchero suffered a torn oblique late in the team’s 102-99 loss to the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday evening, which will sideline him indefinitely, and he will not be evaluated again for 4-6 weeks. “After undergoing further testing today in Cleveland, Orlando Magic forward Paolo Banchero has been diagnosed with a torn right oblique, President of Basketball Operations Jeff Weltman announced today,” the team said in a statement. “Banchero will be out indefinitely and his return to play will depend on how he responds to treatment. He will be re-evaluated in four-to-six weeks. Banchero suffered the injury during the fourth quarter of Orlando’s game at Chicago on Oct. 30.” It’s hard to put into words just how big of a loss this is for Orlando, which had aspirations of building on last year’s fifth-place finish in the East. While it’ll be impossible to completely replace Banchero — who has averaged 29 points, 8.8 rebounds, and 5.6 assists in 36.4 minutes per game this year — much will presumably be asked of Franz Wagner and Jalen Suggs to carry the team in his absence."

	The ball rolled out of the back of an end zone, meaning it was a touchback and went to the Texans.","The New York Jets keep holding on to any little bit of hope that they can turn their season around and reach the heights they aspired towards when the year began, and on Thursday Night Football this week, they had a chance to pick up a win against the Houston Texans, which are considered one of the up-and-coming teams in the AFC. Their defense had a good opening quarter, and after some difficult drives for the offense, it looked like they were able to finally get on the board when Malachi Corley took an end around in for a touchdown. The problem: Even live, it looked like Corley might have pulled a DeSean Jackson and dropped the ball before he crossed the goal line. The bad news was that, yes, he did that. The considerably worse news was that because the ball rolled out of the back of the end zone, this became a touchback, and possession went to Houston. What we thought was a Jets TD… is a touchback! Houston ball 😳#HOUvsNYJ on Prime VideoAlso streaming on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/D3liGAROrt — NFL (@NFL) November 1, 2024  All New York needed was for this to not roll out of the end zone and they would have gotten the ball at the spot where Corley dropped it, which was about two inches out of the end zone.

	Siakam is the early frontrunner for the NBA's best Halloween costume this year.","The Indiana Pacers got off to a bit of a bumpy start to the 2024-25 NBA season, as the team found itself on a 3-game losing streak before knocking off the Boston Celtics in overtime on Wednesday night. It’s not ideal for a team that has aspirations of making it back to the Eastern Conference Finals, but it’s still very early in the season, and as we saw last year, when this team gets hot, they can take it to anyone. Their best player to this point has been Pascal Siakam, who has looked like the exact sort of star forward the team envisioned when they acquired him midway through last season and especially after they handed him a lucrative contract extension this summer. And with the Pacers having an off night on Thursday before a matchup with the Pelicans in New Orleans on Friday, Siakam decided to have a little fun away from the court by dressing up for Halloween as Andre 3000 in the video for “Hey Ya!”  A post shared by Pascal Siakam (@pskills43)  It is an absolutely fantastic costume, but Siakam wanted to take things a step farther. Not only did he dress up like 3 Stacks, he actually recreated a portion of the iconic music video.  A post shared by Pascal Siakam (@pskills43)  Halloween isn’t necessarily a competition among NBA players or anything like that, but it is always fun to see the lengths guys will go to in order to have the most elaborate costume. I think we can safely say that, as of this point, Siakam has set the bar pretty high for the best costume in the league this year."

ESPN reports that the rookie NBA player will make his debut with the minor league squad in a Saturday exhibition against Salt Lake City. However, Bronny will be on the Lakers roster for their game on Friday, squaring off against the underperforming Philadelphia 76ers. 
	Sources close to the Lakers state that Bronny will only play for South Bay during their home games. James will then “shuttle” between both teams during an undisclosed period of time. While it may come as a shock to some fans, Lakers head coach JJ Redick explained that this was the plan they had for Bronny “since day one.” 
	Bronny James’ situation isn’t unique to him, either. As he was selected to the Lakers with the 55th pick of the 2024 NBA Draft, it was expected that he would get some burn in the G League. Historically speaking, players selected late in the second tend to spend time in the minor league to get additional coaching, structure in their respective team’s culture, and gain game reps.

	Bronny James has only played in four games this season for the Los Angeles Lakers out of the eight games so far. The Lakers are currently 10th in the Western Conference with their 4-4 record.

	The 38-year-old rapper was courtside at Scotiabank Arena on Saturday evening (Nov. 2,) as he often is, but it was a special occasion this time; Vince Carter became the first former Raptors player to have his number retired by the franchise. Despite the emotional celebration, the Raptors’ Global Ambassador still had some petty energy to put into the air.

	








 
	Footage showed him and longtime friend Chubbs standing up and glaring at DeRozan, a former Raptors player, when he was on the court. At one point, in true Drizzy fashion, he got on the commentary microphone and spoke with the game’s announcers. “If you ever put up a DeRozan banner, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself,” he said during an interview. At another point in the evening, when discussing the significance of VC’s jersey retirement, the 6 God said “Unfortunately, we’re playing this goof [DeRozan] tonight, but it is what it is.”

	DeMar DeRozan had a chance to be the hero and send the game into overtime with a game-tying three-pointer, but he missed the shot. As the Sacramento Kings and Toronto Raptors players exited the court, Drake could be seen mouthing “F**k outta here, pussy.” 
	In the post-game press conference, reporters asked the six-time All-Star for his thoughts on the Toronto rapper saying he would pull his banner down if the Raptors ever gave him one. “Well he gon’ have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck,” DeRozan said before exiting the podium. 
	Later that evening on his Instagram story, the Compton-born hooper responded to the situation with a clip from Ice Cube and Chris Tucker’s 1995 movie Friday. “Man sit yo a** down,” Cube’s character Craig told Tucker’s character Smokey as the antagonist, Deebo, left their presence. “Man, I got mind control over Deebo,” Smokey said in response. “He be like ‘Shut the f**k up.’ I be quiet. But when he leave, I be talkin’ again.” The clip was especially fitting as Friday is set in South Central Los Angeles, near Compton, where DeRozan and Kendrick Lamar are from.

	This begs the question: Why is Drake angry at DeMar DeRozan, one of the best players ever to don the Toronto Raptors’ jersey, who spent nine seasons with the team and was on record being his good friend? It all goes back to his feud with Kendrick Lamar a few months ago. In June, when K. Dot held his concert The Pop Out in Los Angeles, DeRozan was captured on stage dancing to “Not Like Us.” He doubled down in July when he appeared in the music video for the track. 
	The 35-year-old hooper had been asked about his relationship with the For All The Dogs rapper following the two appearances and assured people that he still had love for him. “Love Drake, always can play him,” he told FOX40 when asked if he could still play Drake’s music following his feud with the Pulitzer Prize winner. “[But] Kendrick been a friend of mine—Damn near family, we both from the same city. Grew up damn near in the same neighborhood, but it’s always been there, it hasn’t been always publicized, but that’s basically family.”  
	Kendrick Lamar made this clear on “Not Like Us,” when he rapped “I’m glad DeRoz’ came home, y’all didn’t deserve him neither,” referring to DeRozan joining the Sacramento Kings this past summer after stints with the Raptors, San Antonio Spurs, and Chicago Bulls.

	In another interview, DeRozan doubled down and stated that they are still friends, but he did what he did for the culture. “Drake’s still my man, still my man, none of it changed,” he told The Sacramento Bee. “It’s so easy to get overlooked and look at it for what it looks like, but at the end of the day it’s music, entertainment. Two of the biggest rappers in the world went at it from a competitive standpoint and they battled it out.” 
	As for being at The Pop Out and in the “Not Like Us” music video, Derozan said: “It was fun to be a part of. For that moment, it was so much bigger than what people look at it as a beef between (Lamar) and Drake. It brought our whole city together in a different type of light where there wasn’t no issues, no violence. Everybody was coming together in a peaceful manner and that was the beauty out of those moments.”

	








 
	Given the fact DeRozan was one of the people Drake unfollowed on Instagram over these last few months, it is safe to believe that Drake felt betrayed; especially by someone whom he comforted in a difficult time. DeRozan spoke with Shannon Sharpe on a 2021 episode of Club Shay Shay about being traded from the Toronto Raptors to the San Antonio Spurs in 2018.  
	DeMar DeRozan was devastated, especially after being told he would not be traded, and the five-time Grammy winner welcomed him into his home to talk for hours. “When it come to him, he’ll forever have a friend in me and loyalty out of me because he cared,” DeRozan told Shannon Sharpe. “He was there for me when everything was just going crazy.”   Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"

	The Chicago Sky star will continue her relationship with the sports apparel brand while also releasing a signature sneaker, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania as of Thursday (Oct. 24). Reese initially signed with Reebok last year while attending LSU. 
	Following the news, Reese took to X to joke that she can now “afford her bills.” The quip comes after she revealed that her WNBA salary doesn’t cover her $8,000 rent and barely covers her car note. 
	Reese reportedly made $73,439 in her rookie season as the No. 7 overall pick of the 2024 WNBA draft. Besides her base pay, the 22-year-old has also signed a slew of endorsements, including Raising Cane’s, Topps, Airbnb, Tampax and Beats by Dre. She also recently dropped her Unapologetically Angel podcast where she’s already seen much traction for her past guests including Kayla Nicole, Shaquille O’Neal, GloRilla and more.

	








 
	Additionally, with Reese’s sneaker gearing up to release under Reebok, that’s sure to bring in much revenue for the company, as well. 
	“I’m extremely excited to let you guys know that we are officially coming out with a Reebok by Angel signature shoe,” she said in a statement, per Bleacher Report. “We’ve already kicked off the design process, and it means the world to me to have Reebok’s full support and confidence with this shoe and overall partnership.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"

	During an appearance alongside Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton on the Young Man and the Three podcast, the former United States President aired his grievances regarding the NBA All-Star Game, which has drawn increasing criticism in recent years. 
	According to Obama, concern of players geting injured during the star-studded game are overblown, as many of those same players regularly participate in summer leagues and offseason runs that are intense without being overtly physical.

	








 
	“Y’all gotta have a little more pride in that All-Star Game,” the 63-year-old told Haliburton, a two-time All-Star himself.

	“It’s not as if you all don’t play pickup during the summers. You know how to play in a way that, ‘Alright, I’m not going to hurt anybody, I’m not going to take anybody out.’ But that All-Star Game, it’s broke, man.” 
	The avid basketball fan continued, comparing current players’ lack of physical exertion with that of greats from past eras. “Like, people just like not running,” Obama continued. “Everybody just trying all kinds of… it used to be when Kobe and Michael and Isaiah and those guys were playing, man. I mean they weren’t playing the way they did regular season, but they wanted to win.” 
	Obama also lamented the perception the All-Star game gives off to casual fans, who may otherwise be inclined to tune into other games during the season, but decide not to. “It insults the game,” the former Senator added.  
	“This is your business. This is your product. You don’t want people thinking you’re all out there just half-a**ed.” Obama concluded his rant by declaring that he will no longer be watching the NBA All-Star Game if no changes are made in the near future. 
	“Y’all need to do something because I ain’t watching that thing no more,” the avid basketball fan warned,   a sentiment that has been echoed by others regarding the NBA All-Star Game activities as a whole.

	“That moment, us being at the scorer’s table together and checking in together, something I will never forget,” LeBron told ESPN during a post-game presser. “No matter how old I get, no matter how my memory may fade as I get older or whatever, I will never forget that moment.” 
	“I tried not to focus on everything that was going on around me and tried to focus on going in as a rookie and not trying to mess up,” Bronny told the media. “But yeah, I totally did feel the energy, and I appreciate the Laker Nation for showing the support for me and my dad.” LeBron James, Ken Griffey Sr., Bronny James, and Ken Griffey Jr. ? pic.twitter.com/hprJFmfnQo

	“I got real on top of my routines to get back to where I was,” detailed the 19-year-old. “I had to do breathing exercises and stuff. It was a total reset.

	On Tuesday (Oct. 22), ESPN released their latest cover story featuring the NBA and NFL stars, respectively, with the photo being a direct nod to legends Randy Moss and Kevin Garnett. Edwards and Jefferson rocked designer shades for their cover, but just as the Minnesota greats did before them, the duo showed respect to each other by donning each other’s jerseys. Behind the scenes of the cover story’s photoshoot showed Jefferson and Edwards bonding and cracking jokes, so much so, you wouldn’t even be able to tell that they went to rival SEC colleges.  
	The two quipped about possibly playing each other’s sport and what positions they’d play. Ant-Man asserted that he would be as big as the Baltimore Raven’s star runningback, Derrick Henry, if he hit the gym because right now he’s “lowkey fat for real.” BossMan Dlow’s “Get In With Me” could be heard soundtracking the visual experience, with the stars going aura for aura as they tried on outfits, flashed their grills, and debated about sports, of course.

	








 
	Meanwhile, the article component to the story followed the superstar’s eventual rise to become the new faces of Minnesota sports. ESPN’s story also explores the similarities between the two men, such as attending SEC colleges before being drafted into the NBA and the NFL in 2020. Regardless of the drip, the swag, and the talk about Randy and Kevin, the two spoke longingly about bringing a championship to Minnesota in their respective sports.

	On Wednesday (Oct. 16), Ball suited up for the Chicago Bulls’ preseason game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, marking a miraculous comeback after numerous knee surgeries and doubts that he would ever play in an NBA game again. 
	Limited to 15 minutes as part of a restriction as he eases himself back into game action, Ball was productive in his return, scoring 10 points on 4 of 6 shooting from the field.

	








 
	Prior to the game, Ball spoke about the effect his injury has had on his playing style and approach to the game. “It’s not the same body I started off with,” Ball said after the Bulls’ shootaround. “But I think I can still be productive and effective on the court. That’s why I’m still trying to play.”

	Ball touched on the struggles surrounding his lengthy recovery process, expressing his gratitiude for the journey, which he feels is now “behind” him.  
	“Long. Really long,” he said of his rehab. “But looking back on it, it went a lot faster than I thought. … Them telling me 18 more months recovery [after the third surgery], it sounds crazy in the moment, but now I’m here. It’s all behind me now.”

	








 
	Ball credited his comeback to his unwavering faith in himself, as well as his trust in the medical staff that assisted him throughout the process.
