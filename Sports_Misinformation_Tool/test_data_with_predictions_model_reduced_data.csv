She's married to Vince. You know, this guy:    The man in the clip above is ""Kane,"" AKA Glenn Jacobs, AKA the current mayor of Knoxville County, Tennessee.   A lot of libs are crying about Linda's qualifications, as if we don't currently have a guy who is transportation secretary solely because he is gay. (He also likes trains.) Linda McMahon served on the Connecticut Board of Education for a year in 2010 and was on the board of trustees for Sacred Heart University in Connecticut. It was reported that her first choice in Trump's Cabinet would have been commerce secretary, a role that went to Howard Lutnick. National Education Association President Becky Pringle complained about Linda, because apparently American schools are doing GREAT under the rule of Democrat politicians and teachers' unions. Others have said she is not qualified because anonymous plaintiffs accused her and her husband in a 2024 lawsuit of covering up child abuse allegedly committed by a WWE announcer in the 1980s. I'm not qualified to speak on all that, so I'll just say that pretty much anyone could be appointed education secretary for the purpose of dismantling the education department with a wrecking ball! As for Kane, well, he and Linda have patched up their totally-real drama of their WWE days.  As for why Linda would want to serve on Trump's Cabinet, she gave $15 million to Trump's 2024 campaign.

And the Texas Land Commissioner is ""100% on board."" 'What I care about is that we have safe communities, and there is no doubt that we are losing too many of our children to these violent criminals that are coming across the border,' Buckingham told Fox News Digital in an interview on Tuesday. 'I am 100% on board with the Trump administration's pledge to get these criminals out of our country, and we are more than happy to offer our resources to facilitate those deportations of these violent criminals.' They'll build the deportation camps. They'll start the processing. And the media and the Democrats, but I repeat myself, will set their hair on fire, cry, go pose at the border, and weep for these criminals. While that happens, keep this in mind. January 20 can't get here fast enough.

Maybe encourage them to live in a manner that aligns with their gender, stay out of the opposite sex bathroom, and don't push your ideology down our throats on a daily basis.

For example, there's a ridiculous viral video from the China version of TikTok making the rounds, which shows a small autonomous AI-powered robot convincing a group of showroom bots to ditch work and go party at its house. I'll give you the translation below. But check this out👇  'Are you working overtime?' the small robot said, starting the conversation.'I never get off work,' another robot answered.'So you're not going home?''I don't have a home.''Then come home with me,' the little robot says.

'Then come home with me,' the little robot says.  And then they all quit their jobs and followed the little robot out the door. Just like that scene in Wall-E with the rogue robots.  It might be tempting to think this whole thing was staged for internet consumption. But Shanghai, the tech company where it happened, has confirmed that this was actually real. Believe it or not, the small bot was from Hangzhou, a competitor, who had been given permission to run a test at Shanghai's facilities. Now their team is looking into exactly how their competitor disabled their robots' protocols and led them away like a metallic pied piper. 'This is not a time to laugh. This is a serious security issue,' one person commented on the video.

The last diverse Superman title they tried fizzled out pretty quickly.</p>","The good news is that DC Comics is dialing back their woke narrative a little bit with their new Superman title. The last diverse Superman title they tried fizzled out pretty quickly.  It turns out no one wants to see an all-powerful gay guy wearing the classic S. So now, they're going in another direction, emphasizing Superman's immigrant status, not unlike Superman: Year One a while back. However, there are some big problems with Superman being an undocumented immigrant. First off, Superman is the last son of the House of El, and that's just way too much privilege for the classist, creative writers at DC, so they're changing Superman's backstory completely: In past comics and adaptations, Superman's iconic symbol on his chest represented the House of El or Kryptonian for hope. In this version, the 'S' represents the members of Krypton's lower class, who suffered under the upper class which led to the destruction of the planet. That's right, in this new story, Superman's classic S is now the sign of an untouchable, like the yellow star of David that the Nazis made Jews wear during World War II. Kal-el's mother is the brilliant one of the family, who wanted to build rockets, but was oppressed by the ruling class and forbidden from attending science school.   And that's how Kal-el gets blasted to Earth just before the ruling class destroys Krypton by dinking with the climate. From there, Kal-el gets found and adopted by the Kents in Kansas, and that leads to our second big problem: Midwestern values.  The writers have Superman reject the Kent's values outright. Instead, Kal-El will spend years on the run across far corners of the globe, living among the planet's most impoverished and persecuted peoples, working in mines and corporate-owned farms, fighting to protect the identity he lost when his homeworld exploded, always yearning to belong, somewhere, anywhere.This is a Kal-El that's a little bit Mowgli, something of a wild boy, with long, unkempt hair and a sometimes fierce and snarling disposition. Given everything he's been through, he's a bit edgier and angrier than the Superman we're used to. This is a Kal-El that's a little bit Mowgli, something of a wild boy, with long, unkempt hair and a sometimes fierce and snarling disposition. Given everything he's been through, he's a bit edgier and angrier than the Superman we're used to. Because nothing says ""superhero"" quite like a savage, all-powerful, almost invulnerable being with a ""snarling disposition."" The best part about Superman - the thing that made him endearing - was always his absolute goodness. Batman is supposed to be the edgy one. But, don't worry, DC is altering him too. No longer a billionaire playboy, Bruce Wayne is now the orphaned son of common people, making gadgets in his garage. Also, he doesn't know martial arts.  And Wonder Woman? Instead of being raised on Themyscira by the Amazons, she was cursed by the gods, raised in hell, and rides around on some kind of demon horse.  On top of all that, DC is charging a whopping $4.99 for digital copies of these abominations.

Apparently they still think the best chicken sandwich on Earth is anti-gay or something. They're delusional for thinking so. Chick-fil-A doesn't even donate to those organizations it was once chided for donating to. So they're just a chicken sandwich shop that's closed on Sundays.

Berlin's police chief has literally come out and warned Jewish people and gays to ""be more attentive"" while in ""neighborhoods in Berlin with a majority of residents from Arab backgrounds."" I'm not joking.  Chief Barbara Slowik told the Berliner Zeitung daily newspaper that the city does not have specific 'no-go zones' for people, but some areas are unsafe for members of the Jewish and LGBTQ communities. There has been a rise of antisemitic incidents in the German capital since the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. A group of schoolchildren recently was attacked in the city. And apparently there are a bunch of Hamas sympathizers in town as well. Ones that will attack Jews and even gays. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what happens when you leave your border wide open and allow another culture to conquer your land. Look at this warning from Slowik: However, there are areas, and we must be honest at this stage, where I would advise people who wear a kippah or are openly homosexual or lesbians to be more attentive.…There are, unfortunately, neighborhoods in Berlin with a majority of residents from Arab backgrounds where there is open sympathy for terrorist organizations and very blatant antisemitism. …There are, unfortunately, neighborhoods in Berlin with a majority of residents from Arab backgrounds where there is open sympathy for terrorist organizations and very blatant antisemitism.

This warning comes after ""6,200 investigations related to antisemitism"" in Germany since October 2023, including these two examples right here: In Germany, a group of Jewish schoolchildren was attacked by a pro-Palestinian group with knives and sticks last week. The 13- to 16-year-old Jewish youth soccer team member were 'hunted down' by Arab children after a game in the Neukölln neighborhood, which is known for its large Arab and Turkish population. Witnesses reported that the attackers had shouted ‘Free Palestine' along with antisemitic slurs.Earlier this month, a fan of the Makkabi Berlin sports club soccer team was hospitalized after being punched in the face by a man who asked if he was Jewish.

Researchers in Israel have discovered what is the oldest known inscription of the utterly true, glorious, and wonderful statement that Jesus Christ is God.  The earliest inscription declaring Jesus as God - deemed 'the greatest discovery since the Dead Sea Scrolls' - was uncovered beneath the floor of an Israeli prison and is now on display in America.The 1,800-year-old mosaic, discovered by an inmate of the Megiddo prison, features the ancient Greek writing: 'The god-loving Akeptous has offered the table to God Jesus Christ as a memorial.' The 1,800-year-old mosaic, discovered by an inmate of the Megiddo prison, features the ancient Greek writing: 'The god-loving Akeptous has offered the table to God Jesus Christ as a memorial.' This is the oldest-known inscription outside of Scripture to declare the deity of Jesus Christ. And it was rediscovered by an inmate in a prison. The Megiddo Mosaic was originally in the world's first Christian prayer hall in 230 AD. The piece is massive, 581 square feet, covering the entire floor of the building. In modern times, the building is an Israeli prison. The mosaic was uncovered in 2005 for research.  Now the mosaic, the entire floor, has been moved piece-by-piece to Washington, DC, where it has been reassembled and is on display at the Museum of the Bible. Alegre Savariego, curator of the exhibition, said: 'The mosaic presents groundbreaking physical evidence of the practices and beliefs of early Christians, including the first archaeological instance of the phrase, 'God Jesus Christ.''  The mosaic features the name of Gaianus, a Roman soldier and Christian who is credited in the mosaic for the commissioning of the piece. This would have been more than 100 years prior to Constantine's Christianization of the Roman Empire. The hall was actually built as a wing of a residential building used by Roman soldiers in the Sixth Ironclad Legion that was stationed nearby at the military camp of Legio. Here's some more information: The prayer hall, or church, was likely abandoned and covered up because the Roman Empire's Sixth Legion was transferred to Transjordan - a region located to the east of the Jordan River.The mosaic also contained the names of five women, highlighting the important role women played in the church.Aside from Akeptous, who was mentioned for her donation of a table to the prayer hall, the mosaic's inscription also says to 'remember Primilla and Cyriaca and Dorothea, and lastly, Chreste.

Now, the SPLC has admitted that this dox-and-smear campaign was done because they think our speech ""has no place in our society.""  Here's that quote from USA Today: 'The SPLC is committed to transparency and is dedicated to protecting the safety of trans and genderqueer individuals when they are publicly attacked,' the SPLC said in a statement. 'Hateful content like the material created by Not the Bee writers works to dehumanize transgender individuals, the entire LGBTQ+ and immigrant communities, and people of color. This divisive commentary has no place in our society.'  It's laughable! Think about it: The majority of Americans just voted for the enforcement of our border laws, removing the religious material of the gender cult from schools, and limiting the ability of doctors to sterilize kids. Is the SPLC saying that the majority of Americans have ""no place in our society""?  But let's probe deeper. Leftists like to argue that a majority opinion on any matter essentially settles the debate on that matter. If 51% of people in a straight democracy voted for a proclamation that gravity doesn't exist, then for them, gravity doesn't exist. But the opinion of the majority doesn't actually decide what is right and true (which is one reason America's founders were so concerned about the tyranny of the mob). So let's take that argument off the table. Let's just look at their arguments point-by-point: Hateful content like the material created by Not the Bee writers works to dehumanize transgender individuals... No. Actually, we think that all people are made in the wondrous image of God as either male or female (Genesis 1:27), and that God formed them in the womb (Psalm 139:14-16) to live in a specific time and place in history (Acts 17:26). We deeply care for people, which is why we do not want them to live in a lie, for love ""does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth"" (1 Corinthians 13:4-7). Modern gender theory is a religious assertion - most often at odds with scientific evidence - that asserts that DNA and human identity/psychology is endlessly malleable. But if this is not true, and humans are designed in a certain way, then going against that ""programming"" will have disastrous results for people and society as a whole. This argument is true whether you believe that humans were designed by a Creator or an endless series of evolutionary mutations. We report on trans issues to HUMANIZE those being deceived by the trans cult, not only because God commands us to, but because the evidence shows how destructive gender theory is to people's lives:    Hateful content like the material created by Not the Bee writers works to dehumanize ... the entire LGBTQ+ and immigrant communities Nah. See, when it comes to the LGBT stuff, we think there's also a design for human sexuality and relationships, and people that live contrarily to that natural design aren't going to flourish like they could (go read Romans 1). But we aren't targeting the gays. We're exposing the groomers and the pedos.    As for immigrants, it's really weird how the SPLC lobbed them in there with the LGBT crowd (commies put them together on their intersectionality charts as ""oppressed"" groups). You'd be hard pressed to find anyone on our staff who has issues with legal immigrants to this country. I used to teach English to international students. I studied Arabic abroad. I helped resettle the family of an Iraqi translator who worked with the U.S. military and was in danger as American forces were pulling out of the country. I worked with a Christian foundation that gave millions of dollars to help refugees abroad and locally. My kids play with the Ethiopian kids who live down the street. But the SPLC suggests I, the editor of this humble little site, am a racist because we have an issue with convicted foreign criminals illegally entering our country before continuing their crime sprees by harming our neighbors:   And if I'm a racist for thinking that our government shouldn't be pumping small American towns with ""migrants"" to replace American workers with foreigners who will work for a pittance, well, then I guess this legal Haitian immigrant is racist?  Not the Bee writers works to dehumanize ... people of color. Lies. Go search our site. Try to find a single time we disparaged someone because of the color of their skin. In fact, we're in the business of calling out people who want to divide us and disparage us based on our skin color.  A few examples:    But the SPLC says that sites like ours - that my voice and the voices of all our amazing writers - have no place in society. That implies that they want us to be silenced. We disagree with them on almost every issue, but we haven't tried to expose their personal details in an effort to censor them. We are more than willing to let people like them speak their minds.

EXCLUSIVE: On Aug. 30, Louisiana Tech's women's volleyball team took the court in Fullerton, California, for a season opener against San Jose State and Spartan senior Blaire Fleming at the annual Cal State Fullerton Invitational. Fleming, one of the top players in the entire Mountain West, has been alleged to be a trans athlete and biological male in multiple lawsuits. Louisiana Tech head volleyball coach Amber McCray confirmed to Fox News Digital on Wednesday that she and her team were unaware of these allegations when they played the match against San Jose State on Aug. 30. LA Tech lost in straight sets as Fleming led the game in kills with 14 and total attacks with 29.  A San Jose State spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital on Wednesday that the Northern California-based university did not formally notify the opponents on its volleyball schedule of the situation involving the first lawsuit and the context in it after it was filed in September. The game between San Jose State and LA Tech took place prior to the first lawsuit, amid a few reports of the situation by multiple media outlets.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Brooke Slusser and Blaire Fleming of the San Jose State Spartans call a play during the first set against the Air Force Falcons at Falcon Court at East Gym on Oct. 19, 2024 in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  (Andrew Wevers/Getty Images) The first court documents that alleged Fleming is a trans athlete were filed in late September when teammate Brooke Slusser joined a lawsuit against the NCAA for its policies on gender identity and eligibility. Slusser alleged that San Jose State made an effort to hide Fleming's biological sex from Slusser and other players since Fleming transferred to the school in 2022. Slusser claims she shared changing spaces and a bedroom with Fleming without knowing that information. When asked if San Jose State notified LA Tech of the situation involving Fleming and complaints by players prior to the first court filings, a San Jose State spokesperson noted that Slusser didn't join the lawsuit until September. That spokesperson has declined to confirm whether any notice was given to LA Tech on the situation prior to that.  However, that spokesperson has confirmed that San Jose State has been in communication with all campuses the team visits for away games to coordinate security. Police protection was assigned to the team at the start of October amid alleged threats against Slusser's well-being, Fox News Digital previously reported. Those security efforts include coordinating backup from other police departments when the team travels. News of the first lawsuit and controversy surrounding Fleming's presence on the team spread and prompted a total of seven forfeited matches from five different teams on San Jose State's schedule.  But LA Tech's head volleyball coach and athletic director claims the team did not have the information to make an informed decision on whether they should forfeit. Instead, McCray said the team found out that next day by word from parents who had heard rumors.  McCray and LA Tech athletic director Ryan Ivey first addressed their lack of knowledge of the situation in an email response to a letter from The Concerned Women of America of Louisiana (CWALA) and its State Director Laura Hubber. SAN JOSE STATE'S BROOKE SLUSSER BACKS TRUMP'S TRANS ATHLETES BAN AFTER ALLEGED UNFAIRNESS FROM SCHOOL In Ivey's response, he indicated that the team would have sought ""a different outcome"" if they had known about the allegations in Slusser's lawsuits, which had been previously reported but not officially notified to LA Tech. ""We received no notification prior to the match with San Jose State that a transgender athlete would be competing.  Had we been notified; we would have worked toward a different outcome. I can assure you that providing a safe and equitable environment for our female student-athletes to compete and live out their dreams and ambitions is of the utmost importance to us,"" Ivey wrote in an email addressed from Ivey to Huber that has been obtained by Fox News Digital.  McCray's email response recounted when her team learned of Fleming's birth sex the following day. ""We were not made aware of Blaire Fleming’s situation until the night after our match against San Jose State, so there was no knowledge of the need to prepare our team for this. It was also the very first match of the season, and the one and only match every year we do not have a prepared scouting report on our opponent because there is no video available yet on the current season’s team and thus no research on their current players. While the public revelation about Blaire Fleming came in April 2024, it did not make national news where it was widely circulated until this Fall 2024 season, hence the reason why San Jose State opponents did not forfeit matches in previous years as they have this year,"" McCray wrote.  McCray also said that she believes the host team at the August invitational, Cal State Fullerton, was not aware of Fleming's birth sex either.  ""Host team Cal State Fullerton did not inform us that a transgender student-athlete was competing on one of the teams invited to the tournament. I am also unsure if they were made aware prior to the competition, or if they found out afterwards like we did,"" McCray wrote.  McCray also confirmed that the LA Tech players were kept in a separate and distant locker room from San Jose State's players.  ""I am unsure of San Jose State’s locker room situation, but I know our team was separated from both other teams as our locker room was on the opposite side of the building from both San Jose State and Cal State Fullerton the entire weekend of [Aug. 30 to Aug. 31],"" McCray wrote.  Louisiana became the 18th state in the U.S. to enact a state law to prevent trans inclusion in women's sports in the summer of 2022.  That July, the state passed the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, which requires schools to ""designate intercollegiate and interscholastic athletic teams according to the biological sex of the team members."" It defines ""biological sex"" as the sex listed on a person's birth certificate at the time of their birth. It also explicitly states that teams designated for females are ""not open to participation"" by anyone whose birth certificate said male, which specifically excludes trans girls and women. The law applies to public elementary, middle and high schools, as well as public universities. It will also apply to any private school or university that receives public funds. The law also gives students and others the ability to sue schools who allow trans girls and women to play on female sports teams, and prevents action taken against anyone who reports a school who violates the law. LA Tech's match against San Jose State took place in California, however, where there is a law to protect trans inclusion in women's sports. Concerned Women for America legislative strategist Macy Petty provided a comment to Fox News Digital on the dialogue between LA Tech and the organization.  ""Dozens of female athletes this fall had to find out through news outlets that the institution they’ve been sacrificing their whole lives for stabbed them in the back. Some of them, such as LA Tech, didn’t even know until after they competed in the farce. The almighty administrators are finally having to answer, and we support these girls as they take to the courts. The legal court, that is,"" Petty said.  Slusser has since filed another lawsuit against the Mountain West and is joined by several other players in the conference in alleging the conference and San Jose State have failed to protect female athletes amid Fleming's ongoing inclusion.  An emergency hearing has been scheduled for Thursday in Denver. A judge will determine whether to grant an injunction that seeks to disqualify San Jose State from competing in the conference tournament and disqualify Fleming from competing in the upcoming conference tournament. The injunction is also seeking to remove the losses from the records of five teams who protested by not competing against SJSU.

(Santiago Mejia/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images) San Jose State finished the regular season with a 14-5 record and a 12-5 conference record. Seven of its wins and six of its conference wins came via forfeit by opposing teams amid the controversy. Utah State and Boise State are in the tournament picture and could be potential opponents for San Jose State in Las Vegas. They have already taken losses. Boise State accepted two losses after refusing to face Fleming earlier in the season.  A Mountain West spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that if San Jose State reaches the final in the upcoming tournament, and their opponent in that game forfeits out of protest, that San Jose State would be recognized as conference champions and earn an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.  San Jose State has repeatedly defended the presence of Fleming on the team.  ""Our athletes all comply with NCAA and Mountain West Conference policies and are eligible to play under the rules of those organizations. Our volleyball team members have earned the right to compete, and we are deeply disappointed for them and with them that they are being denied those opportunities through cancelations and forfeits. We are also proud of how they have persevered through these challenges on the court,"" a statement provided to Fox News Digital by a university spokesperson said.

A heated national controversy over a transgender athlete on the San Jose State women's volleyball team could be the catalyst for a conference title in the upcoming Mountain West Conference tournament.  The tournament is scheduled to begin Nov. 27, and San Jose State is the No. 4 seed. A conference spokesperson told Fox News Digital the conference is preparing a plan in the event teams in the tournament refuse to face San Jose State amid the controversy.  That plan includes the conference's willingness to recognize San Jose State as the Mountain West champion if it reaches the final and the other team in the final forfeits and refuses to play, as conference rules state, the spokesperson confirmed. If that situation does play out, it would also grant San Jose State an automatic bid in the NCAA tournament.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM San Jose State University Spartans head coach Todd Kress speaks with reporters after a loss in an NCAA Mountain West women’s volleyball game against the Colorado State University Rams in Fort Collins, Colo., Oct. 3, 2024. (Santiago Mejia/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images) The decision to forfeit would be left up to the team that would face San Jose State. If the Spartans' opponents make the decision to forfeit, then San Jose State would have to be declared champion.  ""If we get to a championship game, and it's San Jose State vs. whoever, if that institution forfeits the game, then San Jose State wins that match, and then they are tournament champions. And they would be the automatic qualifier out of the Mountain West,"" the spokesperson said.  However, that current system could change very quickly, pending a hearing Thursday.  An emergency hearing has been scheduled for Thursday in Denver. A judge will determine whether to grant an injunction that seeks to disqualify San Jose State from competing in the conference tournament, disqualify Blaire Fleming from competing in the conference tournament and/or remove losses from the records of teams who protested by not competing against SJSU. The conference spokesperson confirmed the conference could have to discard its plan pending the outcome of the hearing.  INSIDE SAN JOSE STATE'S POLICE BATTLE TO PROTECT WOMEN'S ATHLETES THREATENED BY A TRANSGENDER CULTURE WAR San Jose State finished the regular season with a 14-5 record and a 12-5 conference record. Seven of its wins and six of its conference wins came via forfeit by opposing teams amid the controversy.  San Jose State player Brooke Slusser has joined one lawsuit against the NCAA and filed another alongside other Mountain West players against the conference over the alleged presence of her transgender teammate, Blaire Fleming. Slusser has alleged the school deliberately hid Fleming's natural birth sex from her and other players on the team and around the conference.  Slusser previously told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview she and her teammates are unsure about what a potential postseason run might look like as they navigate a demoralized locker room. ""We're just mostly wondering are teams even gonna play us, period, if we go there? Because of just everything that's happened this season,"" Slusser said. ""It seems like every few days it looks like It'll be a fine day and everything's normal and then something else happens. So, I truly do think everyone's just kind of taking things day by day and taking the punches as they come."" San Jose State head volleyball coach Todd Kress has suggested the tension in the locker room may be not be ""a bad thing"" as the team looks to compete for a championship. ""Sometimes tension is not necessarily a bad thing, and I'm not saying that there is. But, you know, when you do have tension or you do have confrontations, I mean, I'm a person that believes that, from confrontation, good things usually happen. We settle our differences, and we work through it,"" Kress told reporters Oct. 3.  After news of the lawsuit and allegations against Fleming began to circulate, San Jose State was dealt several forfeits, including from conference opponents Boise State, Utah State, Wyoming and Nevada. Wyoming and Boise State have each forfeited two matches against the Spartans.  Utah State and Boise State are in the tournament picture and could be potential opponents for San Jose State in Las Vegas. They have already taken losses. Boise State accepted two losses after refusing to face Fleming earlier in the season.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fleming has been one of the top players in the conference and an offensive anchor for San Jose State this season, even amid the controversy. Fleming is third in the conference in average kills per serve with 3.86 and amassed 297 total kills on the year despite playing seven fewer games than expected due to the forfeits. It's helped give San Jose State the third best hitting percentage in the Mountain West.  Slusser alleged in her lawsuit that Fleming's spikes travel more than 80 mph.  ""Brooke estimates that Fleming’s spikes were traveling upward of 80 mph, which was faster than she had ever seen a woman hit a volleyball,"" Slusser’s complaint states. ""The girls were doing everything they could to dodge Fleming’s spikes but still could not fully protect themselves."" Fleming previously set a single-match record at John Champe High School with 30 kills in a match and a single-season record of 266 kills for the school's girls volleyball team. Footage from the athlete's Hudl page of the school-record 30-kill match in September 2019 shows how hard and fast Fleming's spikes came down at the high school level against female opponents. President-elect Trump went out of his way to comment about footage of one of Fleming's plays in which the player spiked a ball at San Diego State player Keira Herron in a match earlier this season. ""I saw the slam. It was a slam. I never saw a ball hit so hard,"" Trump said during a Fox News town hall. ""But other people, even in volleyball, they’ve been permanently — I mean, they've been really hurt badly. Women playing men."" San Jose State's team has had no reservations about making Fleming the centerpiece of the offense amid the ongoing controversy. The team mobbed Fleming in celebration after a game-winning service ace against rival Colorado State in their senior day match Nov. 16.  San Jose State has repeatedly defended the presence of Fleming on the team.  ""Our athletes all comply with NCAA and Mountain West Conference policies and are eligible to play under the rules of those organizations. Our volleyball team members have earned the right to compete, and we are deeply disappointed for them and with them that they are being denied those opportunities through cancellations and forfeits. We are also proud of how they have persevered through these challenges on the court,"" a statement provided to Fox News Digital by a university spokesperson said.

The crew question how much is Aaron Rodgers responsible and what's next for the Jets? Davante Adams likely didn't think the New York Jets would be in a similar situation as the Las Vegas Raiders when he requested a trade to reunite with his good friend Aaron Rodgers, but that's where the team finds itself at 3-8 after yet another loss.  Adams hasn't been the spark expected for the Jets, as he and Rodgers continue to work on getting on the same page. It appears to be too late for this season, though, with GM Joe Douglas now out the door at One Jets Drive with ownership clearing house.  Making his weekly appearance on FanDuel TV's ""Up & Adams,"" host Kay Adams spoke to the veteran wide receiver about the Jets' situation, specifically wondering whether he regrets wanting to be traded to New York.

Hindsight is always 20/20, so you can sit here now and look at it and say, ‘Oh, I could’ve maybe stayed there, would've been more comfortable, wouldn't have to move,' and all that stuff. But for me, it's about going with my gut in my life, and that's how I made my decisions. I live with them."" Davante also explained that this decision to reunite with Rodgers, who he spent successful years with on the Green Bay Packers, was never a gamble. He views it as a calculated decision that simply hasn't worked out in his favor yet.  JETS OWNER WOODY JOHNSON FLOATED BENCHING AARON RODGERS BEFORE FIRING COACH, GM: REPORT ""We're talking about playing with Aaron Rodgers here, too,"" he explained. ""This isn't like taking some crazy gamble, going somewhere with some rookie that's unproven. Neither of us have played what we're capable of playing.  ""But when you're rolling the dice, you'd hope that it's favoring you move. When you got trick dice, it still may not work. We're trying to do everything we can, and we're still going."" Adams, Rodgers and the rest of the Jets' roster may still be going, but there are loads of questions heading into this NFL offseason after how everything unfolded in 2024.  New York Jets wide receiver Davante Adams runs with the ball against the Indianapolis Colts at MetLife Stadium. (Brad Penner-Imagn Images) With six games still to play, the Jets have moved on from their GM and head coach, and reports are coming from left and right talking about how owner Woody Johnson wanted Rodgers benched, while New York reportedly wants to move on from the four-time MVP quarterback after this season as well.  Adams restructured his contract when he came over to the Jets with the expectation they would have a conversation about how to keep him in the building with Rodgers for the foreseeable future.  If Rodgers is gone, or perhaps retires from the game, would Adams still want to remain in New York? There is an opt-out clause for the Jets after this season.  In the meantime, Adams and Rodgers are simply trying to finish the season strong, even if the playoffs appear out of reach.  New York Jets wide receiver Davante Adams scores a touchdown against the Houston Texans, Oct. 31, 2024, in East Rutherford.

U.S. men’s soccer star Christian Pulisic faced criticism for his decision to perform president-elect Donald Trump’s dance as a goal celebration on Monday night against Jamaica. Pulisic told reporters afterward he ""thought it was funny"" and said the dance moves were not ""political"" in nature. The U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF) did not address Pulisic’s dance but cut that part of the clip out when reposting the score on its social media accounts. However, anonymous USSF officials expressed dismay to The Athletic on Tuesday.

Another employee added that the organization has ""more pressing things to worry about."" Forbes columnist Ian Nicholas Quillen and The Athletic writer Jeff Reuter also warned the soccer star to ""consider the impact"" of the dance move and why he ""may come to regret"" it.

Regardless, this is a case where a dance conveys a meaning well beyond a simple gesture. With his nation co-hosting the World Cup in 2026, having the captain and face of the USMNT paying homage to Trump carries outsized subtext, intended or not. ""It doesn’t matter if Pulisic wants that responsibility to consider perception. That comes with being a leader. He can cite eagerness to embrace that type of role but in light of Monday’s dance move, he’d be wise to consider what that distinction truly entails.""

The 49ers moved up from the No. 12 slot to the third pick in a trade with the Miami Dolphins to draft Lance. However, the moving and shaking did not turn out the way the 49ers had hoped – at least in Lance’s case. He started four games for San Francisco and was 2-2.

(AP Photo/Gareth Patterson) Lance suffered a few injuries, and Brock Purdy eventually emerged as the team’s starting quarterback. He was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in 2023 and has sat as the third string quarterback behind Dak Prescott and Cooper Rush. Even with Prescott finished for the 2024 season and Rush not performing well, team owner Jerry Jones said he does not want to see Lance in the game. ""I thought Rush actually had improvement last night from the game before. He didn’t have far to go to get improvement, but I did think he had improvement,"" Jones said in an interview on 105.3 The Fan.

U.S. soccer star Christian Pulisic went viral on Monday night when his goal against Jamaica in the Nations League sparked his own version of a President-elect Donald Trump-inspired dance. The viral dance move has been seen across the sports spectrum. The NFL told Fox News Digital it would not yield a punishment against players from the league.

The Chiefs are now faced with the question of how far have they fallen in the NFL power rankings.,"Keyshawn Johnson breaks down the Detroit Lions' dominant 52-6 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars and declares they're the best team in the NFL. The Detroit Lions have finally broken through and surged to the top of the Fox News Digital Sports NFL power rankings after Week 11. The Lions demolished the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, putting up at least 50 points on their opponent for the second time this season. With the Kansas City Chiefs’ undefeated season coming to an end, the Lions have performed well enough to move up to the top spot. There’s a lot more that had to shake out. The Buffalo Bills defeated the Chiefs, which could catapult them up the rankings. And just how far will the Chiefs fall? Read below to find out the rest of the rankings. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown celebrates his nine-yard touchdown reception with fans during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Detroit. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) For the first time in the history of Fox News Digital's NFL power rankings, and likely many others across the web, the Detroit Lions are the kings. With a loss by Kansas City and a day of dominance in Jacksonville, the Lions have as much momentum as they've ever had in the Super Bowl era. Last week: 2 Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen (17) is congratulated by teammate Dawson Knox after scoring on a 26-yard run during the second half of an NFL football game against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Orchard Park, N.Y. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) It wasn’t the AFC Championship, but it sure felt like it for Bills fans after Buffalo overpowered the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday afternoon to hand the back-to-back champions their first loss of the season. With most of the division in shambles, the Bills are primed to win the AFC East for the fifth straight season, but more importantly, they seem primed to make a serious run for the Super Bowl. Last week: 3 Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is sacked by Buffalo Bills linebacker Terrel Bernard during the first half of an NFL football game on Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Orchard Park, N.Y. (AP Photo/Jeffrey T. Barnes) It finally happened, for the first time since last Christmas, the Kansas City Chiefs lost a game. Any time the Buffalo Bills have matched up with the Chiefs over the past few seasons, the games have typically been thrillers. However, the Bills being able to knock off the Chiefs proved to be a noticeable difference from recent matchups. Even during the Chiefs first nine wins, much of the conversation has revolved around whether Kansas City was playing its best football. Patrick Mahomes has not looked like the best quarterback in the world this season. While he threw three touchdowns during the Nov. 17 game, he also finished the day with two interceptions, including a pick late in the fourth quarter to end any hopes of a Chiefs comeback. The 30-21 loss also meant the Chiefs will have to wait a bit longer for an opportunity to wrap up the top playoff seed in the AFC. But recent history suggests Kansas City is not reliant on the No. 1 seed as two of the three Super Bowl championships under head coach Andy Reid have been earned without the team holding the top seed. Last week: 1 Eagles running back Saquon Barkley scores during the second half of an NFL football game against the Washington Commanders on Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum) The Eagles had a ""Thursday Night Football"" matchup that everyone wanted to see, with Jayden Daniels and the Commanders heading into ""The Linc"" to play for first place in the division. Though Jalen Hurts didn’t really get going in the pass game, it was Saquon Barkley yet again stepping up when his team needed it, scoring two fourth-quarter touchdowns to cement the team’s sixth straight win. It seems like ages ago when questions about whether this highly talented team could really get going, as they are one of the hottest teams in the NFL. Last week: 5 Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson (3) reacts with teammates Najee Harris, left, and Darnell Washington at the end of an NFL football game against the Baltimore Ravens, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) They beat the Ravens without scoring a touchdown, which is hard to do in the NFL, but not in that matchup because the Steelers dominate the Ravens, having won eight out of the last nine games.  Last week: 6 Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson speaks to reporters following an NFL football game against the Steelers, Nov. 17, 2024, in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Matt Freed) We're good. We're middling. We're good. We're not so good. We're good again. They need to make up their minds. Last week: 4 Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold runs off the field after an NFL football game against the Titans, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/George Walker IV) The Vikings finished up their cupcake slate and looked just good enough to stay within striking distance of first place in the NFC North. Still, how the team looked in non-blowout wins against the lowly Titans and Jaguars shows that they are still a class below Detroit, especially after the Lions' real blowout against Jacksonville this week. Last week: 8 Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert high-fives running back J.K. Dobbins before an NFL football game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Inglewood, Calif. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull) The Chargers put together arguably their best first half of the season when they hosted the Cincinnati Bengals this past Sunday night. But the second half was a different story. Nevertheless, Los Angeles held off a furious rally from the Bengals and secured their seventh win of the season. Cincinnati made it a 27-27 game after Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert fumbled the ball in the fourth quarter. But Herbert later completed a pair of clutch passes to Ladd McConkey that helped set up J.K. Dobbins’ 29-yard touchdown run with 18 seconds remaining. The Chargers welcome another high-powered offense this week when they host Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens. Last week: 11 Green Bay Packers Jayden Reed (11) celebrates his touchdown catch with Christian Watson (9) and John FitzPatrick during the first half of an NFL football game against the Bears on Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) It's hard to judge how good this Packers team is after a win against the Bears. It is so expected that coming as close as they did to losing to Chicago is almost cause for an indictment on Green Bay. The Packers will be easier to judge after games against the 49ers and Lions in the next three weeks. Last week: 9 Houston Texans running back Joe Mixon (28) and quarterback C.J. Stroud celebrate Mixon's touchdown run against the Dallas Cowboys during the first half of an NFL football game, Monday, Nov. 18, 2024, in Arlington, Texas. (AP Photo/Jerome Miron) Joe Mixon is putting up the best season of his career, and now that Nico Collins is healthy, this team will only be getting better. C.J. Stroud has had a bit of a sophomore slump, but a light schedule coming up could get him back on track. Last week: 12 Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels is sacked by Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham during the first half of an NFL football game on Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum) A true test came on Thursday night for Jayden Daniels & Co., and though it was close early, Saquon Barkley showed up late with two touchdowns to virtually ice it for the Eagles. Washington has now dropped two straight, falling to second place in the division. They have another divisional matchup this week with the Cowboys, a game that head coach Dan Quinn surely wants to win considering his ties to the organization last season as their defensive coordinator. Last week: 7 Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray greets fans after an NFL football game against the New York Jets, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) NFC West first place by itself coming out of the bye week is not a bad place to be for Arizona. Back-to-back road games in Seattle and Minnesota will tell us if Kyler Murray & Co. are for real. Last week: 13 Broncos quarterback Bo Nix (10) runs as Atlanta Falcons cornerback Natrone Brooks pursues during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Denver. (AP Photo/Jack Dempsey)  The Broncos completed their 4-0 sweep of the NFC South with a dominant 38-6 win over the Falcons. Bo Nix threw for over 300 yards and four touchdowns as he continues to look better and better every week, firmly putting himself in the Offensive Rookie of the Year conversation. Sitting at 6-5 with their next three games coming against the Raiders, Browns and Colts, the Broncos have their eyes set on making a playoff push. Last week: 16 San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy walks off the field after an NFL football game against the Seattle Seahawks in Santa Clara, Calif., Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Jed Jacobsohn) You know what this banged up team doesn’t need? Back-to-back road trips to playoff-contending teams, uh-oh, at Green Bay and at Buffalo are coming right up. Last week: 10 Seattle Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith reacts after scoring against the San Francisco 49ers during the second half of an NFL football game in Santa Clara, Calif., Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez) The roller-coaster ride that is Seattle this season continued last week. Stopping a six-game skid to San Francisco was a high point for sure. Can the Seahawks finally find consistency? Last week: 19 Atlanta Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins runs off the field after an NFL football game on Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) Atlanta was destroyed in Week 11 by the Denver Broncos, and the team’s weak defense was badly exposed. They’re still in position to win the division due to their perfect record against NFC South opponents, but this is not a team that should be feared come playoff time. Last week: 14 Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Cooper Kupp (10) is congratulated after his touchdown against the New England Patriots during the first half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Foxborough, Mass. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) Remember last year? The Rams started 3-6 before clawing back to .500 and rolling into the playoffs on a hot streak. This year’s version has a similar vibe, especially if they can get past the Eagles at home on Sunday night. Last week: 18 Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield passes against the San Francisco 49ers during the second half of an NFL football game in Tampa, Fla., Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024. (AP Photo/Chris OMeara) The bye week came at a perfect time, and with Atlanta continuing to struggle, Tampa Bay must believe it is the best team in the NFC South despite being 1.5 games back. They have upcoming games against three of the worst teams in the league (Giants, Panthers, Raiders), and if they can win all three, the division race gets extremely interesting. Last week: 17 Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow throws as he is tackled by Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Daiyan Henley during the second half of an NFL football game on Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Inglewood, Calif. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull) They are wasting an MVP season by Joe Burrow. Last week: 15 Miami Dolphins tight end Jonnu Smith, center, celebrates his touchdown with wide receivers Tyreek Hill (10) and Jaylen Waddle during the first half of an NFL football game against the Las Vegas Raiders, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Miami Gardens, Fla. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell) The Dolphins' biggest offensive stars haven’t been putting up numbers as expected, but Miami is still winning down the stretch, picking up their second-straight win with a dominant 34-19 win over the Raiders. Last week: 20 Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson reacts after scoring a touchdown against the New York Jets during the fourth quarter of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in East Rutherford, N.J. (AP Photo/Adam Hunger) Maybe Anthony Richardson needed a break and take a good look in the mirror. And perhaps it was smart of the Colts to get him back against the lowly Jets, since nothing is going right for Gang Green. The fourth overall pick of the 2023 draft showed what he could be, but it’s too early to say he’s here to stay. Last week: 22 Bears Caleb Williams walks off the field after an NFL football game against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) It's been a humbling stretch for a Bears team that started off with so much hope. A heartbreaking loss to the Packers could either be rock bottom or the straw that breaks their back into a losing streak that buries them, especially with games against the other playoff contenders in their division coming up. Last week: 21 New Orleans Saints tight end Taysom Hill, left, celebrates a touchdown with quarterback Derek Carr in the second half of an NFL football game in New Orleans, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) The Saints followed their upset win over the Falcons with a 21-point victory over lowly Cleveland. Their hopes of getting the No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft are probably dead, but the team is playing hard under interim coach Darren Rizzi, and the Saints could be a spoiler team come December. Last week: 24 Dallas Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb reacts during the second half of an NFL football game against the Houston Texans, Monday, Nov. 18, 2024, in Arlington, Texas. (AP Photo/Gareth Patterson) There’s not much else to say about Dallas as they’ve now lost five straight games after a beatdown by the Houston Texans at AT&T Stadium. The metal sheet falling from the dome hours before the game could be a metaphor for how this Cowboys season is crumbling around Jerry Jones & Co. Last week: 25 New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers walks off the field after the Jets lost an NFL football game to the Indianapolis Colts, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in East Rutherford, N.J. (AP Photo/Adam Hunger) Another loss for the Jets has triggered yet another shakeup within the organization as owner Woody Johnson decided to call it quits with general manager Joe Douglas on Tuesday. At 3-8 and with their playoff aspirations all but gone, who’s on the chopping block next? Last week: 23 New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye scrambles against the Los Angeles Rams during the first half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Foxborough, Mass. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) Drake Maye put on a show, completing 30-of-40 passes for 282 yards and two touchdowns, but it wasn’t enough for New England to overcome the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. Poor execution and a nonexistent defense have the Patriots looking toward the draft for solutions. Last week: 26 Cleveland Browns quarterback Jameis Winston (5) is tackled by Saints defensive end Chase Young (99) and defensive tackle Bryan Bresee in the second half of an NFL football game in New Orleans, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) Blown out by the Saints on Sunday, and then they get to play the division-leading Steelers on Thursday — not a wonderful week.  Last week: 27 Carolina Panthers quarterback Bryce Young celebrates after an overtime win in an NFL football game against the New York Giants, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Munich. (AP Photo/Lennart Preiss) The Panthers had a bye in Week 11 after back-to-back victories, but things get a lot tougher the rest of the way. Carolina has to play the Chiefs, Bucs and Eagles over the next three weeks. They are still in play for the top pick in the NFL Draft, which has to be the goal at this point, especially given their schedule down the stretch. Last week: 28 Tennessee Titans quarterback Will Levis walks off the field after an NFL football game against the Minnesota Vikings, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/George Walker IV) Against a Sam Darnold who has been looking a bit like the old Sam Darnold in recent weeks, the Titans mustered up just 13 points. There are a lot of bad teams in the league this year, and Tennessee is right in the pack of them. Last week: 30 Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Doug Pederson talks to the media after an NFL football game against the Lions, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Detroit. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) Allowing 52 points is unacceptable no matter what. A bad team with Trevor Lawrence only gets worse when he’s injured. Mac Jones has scored just one touchdown – a rushing score of his own – since he took over. Last week: 29 New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones watches during the second half of an NFL football game against the Carolina Panthers, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Munich. (AP Photo/Lennart Preiss) This bye week for New York was a true team evaluation, and what was already written on the walls was confirmed by head coach Brian Daboll. Daniel Jones’ time in New York is all but done as he was demoted to third string and Tommy DeVito, the fan favorite who won three games for New York last season, will be the starter moving into Week 12 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. While that may get fans in seats for John Mara, the organization is already thinking to the future with their franchise quarterback being a bust. Last week: 32 Las Vegas Raiders tight end Brock Bowers runs for a touchdown during the second half of an NFL football game against the Miami Dolphins, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024, in Miami Gardens, Fla. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) Despite making a litany of changes to the offensive coaching staff over the bye week, the Raiders still lost 34-19 to the Dolphins. One of the few bright spots on the 2-8 Raiders is rookie tight end Brock Bowers. Bowers is already one of the best tight ends in the NFL, catching 13 passes for 126 yards and a touchdown in the loss.

However, the teenager has struggled to break into the first team at the Bernabeu and is said to be keen on a loan move to gain more regular playing time. According to reports, Arsenal believe they can help get Guler’s career back on track, much like they did with Odegaard. The Norwegian midfielder initially joined the Gunners on loan in 2021 before the club later made the move permanent. While Real Madrid may be reluctant to let Guler leave on a permanent basis at this stage, a loan deal could suit all parties involved. Arsenal are hopeful they can provide the young Turkish international with the platform to showcase his undoubted talent, which earned him a move to the Spanish giants in the first place. The report suggests Arsenal are eager to replicate the successful Odegaard case, where the midfielder flourished during his time in north London before becoming a key player for Real Madrid. Whether the Spanish club will be open to another loan arrangement remains to be seen, but Arsenal are evidently keen to add Guler to their squad in January.",2024-11-20,unknown,29.478,credible,1,1,0.29,0.71

The SkyBar, a 700-square-meter luxury space with a capacity of 200, was touted as the crown jewel of the stadium’s £1.5 billion redevelopment. Tickets were expected to cost up to £2,500 per match, potentially generating £500,000 per home game for Real Madrid. However, the SkyBar has remained unopened, six months after it was originally scheduled to welcome guests. This has prompted Anastasia Gourmet, the company awarded the rights to run the space, to file a lawsuit against the club. The lawsuit claims Anastasia Gourmet has been blocked from accessing the new premises, leading to an estimated £6 million in losses from suppliers. Real Madrid has not yet commented on the legal challenge. The delay in opening the SkyBar is reportedly due to issues with adapting the stadium to comply with local anti-noise regulations, after protests from neighbors. This has also led to a suspension of the Bernabeu’s concert hosting rights until spring 2025. With the majority of the Bernabeu’s £1.5 billion redevelopment complete, the final stages are now expected to be finished by January 2025. But the legal dispute over the SkyBar represents an unwelcome complication for Real Madrid as they seek to maximize the revenue potential of their revamped stadium.",2024-11-20,unknown,29.478,credible,1,1,0.38,0.62

The Spanish giants have been playing at the Estadio Olimpico for the past 18 months while a £1.25 billion renovation project is carried out on their home ground. The project aims to increase the stadium’s capacity from 99,000 to 104,000 and add a roof, luxury bars, and new escalators. Barcelona had hoped to move back to the Nou Camp before the end of 2024. However, UEFA rules prohibit clubs from changing stadiums during the initial phase of the Champions League. This means Barcelona would have had to split home games between the Nou Camp and Estadio Olimpico, which was deemed logistically difficult and costly. As a result, Barcelona have now confirmed they will not return to the Nou Camp until at least mid-February 2025. This delay will impact several La Liga matches, including games against Valencia, Alaves, and Atalanta in the Champions League, which will now take place at the Estadio Olimpico. Barcelona have promised to discount the price of season ticket passes to account for the matches moved from the Nou Camp. The club currently sits top of the La Liga table and is well-positioned to qualify for the Champions League knockout stages.

Guardiola’s current deal was set to expire at the end of the 2024-25 season, but the new agreement will keep the 53-year-old Spaniard at the Etihad Stadium until 2026. This will extend his tenure as City’s manager to a decade. Since taking over in 2016, Guardiola has led Manchester City to 18 trophies, including six Premier League titles and the Champions League. His continued presence will be crucial as the club faces an investigation into alleged breaches of Premier League financial rules. The contract extension comes at a critical juncture, with City struggling with injuries and having lost their last four matches across all competitions – the worst run of Guardiola’s tenure. The news provides much-needed continuity as the team aims to regain their form. Speculation over Guardiola’s future had increased in recent months, particularly after the club announced the departure of long-time director of football Txiki Begiristain at the end of the season.

If you’ve ever watched a one-sided game and thought, “This is too predictable,” you’ve just stumbled upon the essence of handicap betting. It’s a way to make sports more thrilling, balance out mismatched teams, and, if played right, give you an edge that money-line or over/under bets simply can’t provide. Picture this: a clash between a powerhouse like Manchester City and a struggling team hanging on by a thread in the Premier League. Betting on City to win outright might feel like betting on the sun to rise—it’s obvious, but it won’t pay much. Handicap betting, however, levels the playing field, essentially giving the underdog a head start or the favorite a deficit to overcome. Suddenly, that David vs. Goliath match has teeth, and your bet transforms from a dull formality into a nail-biter. Here’s how it works: bookmakers assign a virtual advantage or disadvantage to teams before the game begins. For example, if City starts with a -2 handicap, they need to win by at least three goals for your bet to cash. If you’re rooting for the underdog with a +2 handicap, they could lose by one goal or even draw, and you’d still come out ahead. It’s not just betting; it’s re-imagining the game itself. This format is especially popular in football (soccer), basketball, and even esports, where disparities in team strength are common. Asian Handicap takes it a step further, slicing matches into smaller, more precise betting opportunities. With half-goal or quarter-goal handicaps, draws are eliminated from the equation, narrowing the focus on whether a team exceeds expectations or falls short. Suddenly, every possession, every shot on goal, every free throw carries heightened importance. If you’re new to this, let me tell you: the learning curve is more of a thrill ride than a struggle. Handicap betting requires a deeper understanding of the game, forcing you to analyze stats, predict performance trends, and identify hidden value in odds. It’s not just about gut feelings; it’s about doing your homework and loving every second of it. There’s something exhilarating about predicting that a lowly underdog will keep it tight against the juggernaut, only to watch your analysis unfold perfectly on the field or court. Success in handicap betting hinges on knowing the teams like the back of your hand. Which player is in form? Who’s nursing an injury? How do they fare on home turf versus away? Sure, it’s more effort than casually picking a winner, but the reward is sweeter. Watching a game through the lens of a handicap bet sharpens your senses. A 90th-minute consolation goal isn’t just filler—it’s the difference between victory and heartbreak. But don’t let the thrill cloud your judgment. Start small and focus on sports you genuinely understand. Handicap betting isn’t for blind guessing; it’s for those who savor the process, the nuance, the game within the game. And don’t get greedy chasing crazy odds. A +0.5 or -1 handicap might seem modest, but small victories pave the road to long-term gains. The real power lies in consistency, not in one-off miracles. The beauty of handicap betting lies in its ability to make every matchup meaningful. A lopsided fixture becomes an intellectual challenge. A seemingly dull game morphs into a strategic playground. Handicap betting doesn’t just change how you bet; it changes how you watch, think, and talk about sports. It’s not just a tool—it’s a philosophy. So, the next time you’re staring at a betting slip, wondering how to spice things up, remember the handicap. It’s not about complicating the game—it’s about leveling the field, elevating your strategy, and rediscovering the thrill of the unpredictable. In a world of simple yes-or-no outcomes, handicap betting is the curve-ball that turns you from a casual observer into a sharp-minded competitor. That’s why it’s key to win.",2024-11-20,unknown,29.478,credible,1,0,0.66,0.34

But this isn’t a gut-instinct bet or a lucky hunch; this is calculated precision—an algorithm running millions of simulations while you sip your drink. AI sports betting isn’t just a buzzword. It’s a revolution, and it’s flipping the odds, literally and figuratively, in favor of gamblers. AI thrives on data, and in sports, there’s plenty of it. Every pass, every foul, every weather report, and every player injury—it’s all fed into these artificial brains to generate predictions more precise than a veteran handicapper’s wildest dreams. Gone are the days when you’d rely on your buddy’s “expert” insight about which team to back. With AI, you’re armed with more data than a Vegas bookmaker has scribbled on their chalkboards. Take, for example, predictive modeling. This is where AI doesn’t just analyze past games; it dissects them. It examines patterns, finds correlations, and even evaluates the emotional state of players based on interviews or social media posts. A star quarterback had a fight with his coach last week? That’s in the algorithm. The underdog team just switched to a new playbook? The AI factors in their past games under similar circumstances. It’s like having a crystal ball—if the crystal ball could also solve calculus in a nanosecond. Gamblers are also seeing the rise of AI-driven platforms that level the playing field. Apps and services now offer real-time betting recommendations, using machine learning to assess how odds shift during a game. You don’t have to panic when the team you backed goes down early in the first quarter. The AI calculates whether a comeback is likely and suggests if you should double down or hedge your bet elsewhere. It’s all about options—smarter, faster, and grounded in cold, hard data. One of the most jaw-dropping aspects is live betting. Picture this: You’re watching a soccer match, and in the 62nd minute, the AI predicts a 72% chance of a specific player scoring. You place your bet. Ten minutes later, the ball sails into the net, and your phone buzzes with winnings. The system analyzes momentum, player fatigue, substitutions, and more—all faster than any human ever could. Of course, it’s not all sunshine and fat wallets. The sportsbooks are using AI, too. They’re monitoring betting patterns, detecting anomalies, and adjusting odds at lightning speed. They can even predict how the general betting public will react to certain outcomes and set lines to protect their profits. It’s like an arms race, gamblers vs. the house, and AI is the weapon of choice for both sides. Some skeptics argue that AI takes the “fun” out of gambling, turning it into a science project instead of an adrenaline rush. But let’s be real: isn’t the point of betting to win? And if you can turn a weekend hobby into a lucrative side hustle thanks to AI, why wouldn’t you? It’s not just hardcore gamblers jumping on this bandwagon, either. Casual fans are starting to dip their toes in, lured by the promise of smarter bets. Who wouldn’t want a tool that tells you, with a solid degree of confidence, which underdog might pull off an upset? It’s like having a friend who’s memorized every stat in sports history—and never gets tired of crunching numbers. The implications are massive. AI isn’t just about gambling; it’s reshaping how we think about risk and reward in general. It’s teaching us that intuition, while exciting, isn’t as reliable as a well-trained neural network. And while luck will always have its place in sports betting, AI is making it clear that skill—or at least access to superior tools—plays an increasingly dominant role. So, next time you place a bet, remember: somewhere, an AI is crunching numbers, making predictions, and probably giving someone else the edge. The question is, will it be you?",2024-11-20,unknown,29.478,credible,1,1,0.47,0.53

If you’ve ever found yourself staring at a lineup of games, trying to make sense of the chaos and come out on top, you’re not alone. But the truth is, the pros don’t leave things to chance. They’ve got a toolkit of strategies that make predicting a straight win feel almost like a science. Let’s dive into what makes their approach so effective, and maybe, just maybe, you’ll see your bets start to pay off in ways you never imagined. First off, let’s clear one thing up: betting isn’t magic. Forget the myths about “fixed games” or whispering insiders who supposedly know the outcome. Real success starts with research. The pros don’t just glance at the league table and pick the team at the top. They dig deeper. Think form analysis. How has the team been performing in their last five games? A squad might be leading the table, but if they’ve just limped through a streak of draws or narrow wins, their confidence might not be as solid as it seems. Patterns in form reveal more than just who’s winning—it shows how they’re winning. Dominating games? Or scraping through by sheer luck? That makes a world of difference. Now, let’s talk head-to-head records. Teams often have psychological edges against specific opponents. You know those matchups where even the strongest squad crumbles against a so-called underdog? That’s not coincidence. Call it history, call it mentality—whatever it is, it matters. Before predicting a straight win, always check how the teams have fared against each other in the past. Even if Team A has been flying high all season, a poor track record against Team B could be their Achilles’ heel. Injuries and suspensions are another massive factor. Imagine betting on a top-tier team without knowing their star striker is out with a hamstring issue or their key defender is suspended. That’s the kind of oversight that can sink even the most “obvious” predictions. Stay updated on team news. If half the squad is out or fatigued from back-to-back fixtures, they’re far less likely to deliver that confident win. One trick that sets pros apart is how they evaluate the stakes of a game. Is it a must-win for one side? Or a dead-rubber match where the outcome doesn’t matter? A team fighting for survival in a relegation battle will likely play with desperation and heart, while a team comfortably mid-table might already be mentally checked out. Motivation, or lack thereof, can completely flip the narrative of a game. Here’s where it gets even more fun: analyzing the manager’s tactics. Certain managers are just brilliant at grinding out results, especially in high-pressure scenarios. Watch for interviews, press conferences, and recent tactical shifts. A manager who talks about tightening up the defense probably won’t let their team play recklessly, making a straight win more plausible if they’re up against a weaker attack. Let’s not forget the betting odds themselves. They tell a story. If a team widely expected to win suddenly sees their odds shift, ask yourself why. Odds don’t move without reason—sharp bettors and insiders might know something you don’t. Always cross-reference odds movements with your own research to avoid surprises. And finally, trust your gut—but only if it’s backed by data. Betting isn’t about whims or “feelings.” Sure, sometimes you’ll have that inexplicable hunch, but if it’s not rooted in solid evidence, it’s better to skip the bet than gamble blindly. Straight wins aren’t guaranteed, but by layering your intuition over a foundation of research, you’re giving yourself the best shot. So, the next time you’re ready to predict a straight win, remember: it’s not about being flashy or making wild guesses. It’s about playing smart. Learn the teams, read the stats, and keep your finger on the pulse of what’s happening in the world of sports.

French Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra called Mohamad Camara's actions ""unacceptable"" and for ""firm sanctions"" against both the player and the club. Camara, who is Muslim, covered the badge with white tape and refused to participate in a pregame photo in front of a banner carrying the same message. ""Homophobia is not an opinion, it’s a crime,"" Aurore Bergé, the French minister of equality, wrote on X. ""And homophobia kills. There must be strict punishment for Mohamed Camara."" Camara missed the first four games of this year's Ligue de Football Professionnel season. In October, the German professional soccer club VfL Wolfsburg disciplined player Kevin Behrens after he refused to autograph a gay pride shirt and made comments considered homophobic toward a fan who requested it.  The player allegedly refused to sign a Wolfsburg shirt that featured a rainbow logo for the LGBTQ pride flag. Behrens also allegedly said, ""I won’t sign that gay [crap],"" according to multiple reports.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The big three of Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey and Paul George is 2-11. The Philadelphia 76ers have had an unimaginable start to their season after making big splashes in signing George and extending Embiid and Maxey's contracts. But, apparently, they reached a breaking point Monday.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The Philadelphia 76ers' Joel Embiid walks off the court after the 76ers lost an Emirates NBA Cup game against the New York Knicks Nov. 12, 2024, in Philadelphia.  (AP Photo/Matt Slocum) After blowing a double-digit lead to the Miami Heat, coaches and players reportedly held a team meeting in the locker room that lasted about 1½ hours ""A lot was said, a lot was accepted, a lot was aired out,"" ESPN's Shams Charania said on Tuesday's edition of ""The Pat McAfee Show."" The meeting included players telling head coach Nick Nurse they needed to be coached harder, and Nurse saying he wanted players more dialed in during practice. However, the big takeaway was that their superstar, Embiid, was called out. Maxey reportedly ""challenged"" Embiid to stop being late for ""everything."" ""There is a trickle-down effect. When you are missing, when you are late to what I was told ‘everything,’ it has an effect on the rest of the locker room,"" Charania added.

Daniel Jones' New York Giants career is all but done after head coach Brian Daboll confirmed the man the franchise signed to be their long-term quarterback has been demoted to third string following the bye week.  Tommy DeVito, who won three games for New York in place of the injured Jones and Tyrod Taylor, was elevated to starting quarterback, leapfrogging Drew Lock, who was signed to a $5 million deal this offseason to be Jones' backup.  Daboll called benching the No. 6 overall pick of the 2019 NFL Draft a ""hard decision,"" and it's one that has some Giants players confused, including defensive captain Dexter Lawrence.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM New York Giants defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence II before the game against the Green Bay Packers at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on Dec. 11, 2023. (Vincent Carchietta-USA Today Sports) ""He's the QB1. To me, the best quarterback on the team,"" Lawrence said, via the New York Post, during a volunteering event at Community Food Bank of New Jersey on Tuesday. ""But they see things differently. I guess that's all that matters."" Lawrence added that there was a ""little bit of confusion,"" though he isn't sure what the conversations were like with the front office and coaching staff regarding the decision to demote Jones.  GIANTS TO BENCH DANIEL JONES FOR WEEK 12: REPORTS ""I think we trust the coaches and where they’re going and where they think we can go,"" Lawrence explained. ""That’s what you have to do. You have to be naive and trust the process. You think about the wrong s--- and then you start playing like s---."" Of course, Lawrence and Jones, both team captains, have developed a close friendship over the years, with the former calling the latter his ""best friend."" So, when Lawrence, arguably the best defensive tackle in the game, sees his best friend benched, he's going to defend him.  ""It’s tough for that [benching] to happen,"" Lawrence said. ""I can’t control it. They made the decision based off their evaluations, and thoughts and feelings. You’ve got to respect it as a player, even though you don’t like it. As a player, you have to keep playing. As a human and as a brother, I feel for him."" While Jones' work ethic has never been questioned, the results just haven't been there since he signed his four-year, $160 million extension two offseasons ago – an offseason that is now infamous as Saquon Barkley was franchised tagged and walked into free agency to sign with the Philadelphia Eagles before the start of this year.  New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones passes the ball against the Washington Commanders, Sunday, Nov. 3, 2024, in East Rutherford, New Jersey. (AP Photo/John Munson) Jones has gone 3-13 in the past two seasons, with 2023 ending early due to a season-ending knee injury. He also has the 32nd quarterback rating in the NFL (79.4) this season, and has thrown eight touchdowns to seven interceptions over 10 games.  The Giants' offense is the lowest-scoring unit in the league this season with Jones starting every contest.  Jones' benching is also a move for the front office to save money, as he has a $23 million injury guarantee built into the contract GM Joe Schoen signed off on in 2023. That won't activate, and with an opt-out built in after two years, the Giants are expected to release him after the 2024 campaign comes to a close.  ""He’s strong. He gets the business side of it,"" Lawrence said of how Jones has handled the news of the benching. ""I guess they talked about it. He obviously doesn’t like the choice that was made. But he has to live with it, and I think he’ll grow through it."" But, at the same time, Lawrence knows that ""teams lose games, not just one player,"" and the Giants have the league's worst rushing defense – an area they wanted to clean up after struggling in that department last season as well. Defensive coordinator Shane Bowen, who was previously with the Tennessee Titans, was brought in because of his success in that area, but it hasn't worked out thus far.  New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones during the Carolina Panthers game, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Munich, Germany. (AP Photo/Lennart Preiss) The reality of the Giants' situation is that the rebuild continues, and once again, they find themselves needing someone else to be their franchise quarterback. They thought that's what Jones was following a great 2022 campaign that saw them not only make the playoffs for the first time since 2016, but defeat the Minnesota Vikings in the wild-card round.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Instead, they will look to free agency and the NFL Draft to see if there's a new signal caller that can get them out of the rut they've been snuck in for most of Jones' Giants career.

Taylor Swift fans set their sights on the wife of Buffalo Bills player Baylon Spector for some trash talk over Sunday's big game.  After the Bills gave Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs their first loss of the season on Sunday, Ryleigh Spector took the opportunity to boast. The linebacker's wife made a post on social media celebrating the Chiefs' victory while taking a shot at Swift.  ""9-2! Never a Swiftie,"" she wrote on her Instagram Stories over a photo of her at the game.  The brag quickly caught the attention of Swift fans across social media, who rushed to attack Spector while defending Swift.

(AP Photo/Jeffrey T.

When I read all this crap I think I’m back in high school. I wonder why our country is so screwed up. We have a hard time treating people with kindness very sad to see,"" the user wrote.  Another user said the linebacker's wife should be embarrassed.  ""Really? So unnecessary and immature. You would think women would support someone who has brought so many other women and children for that matter back to loving the sport. Shows their true character. They should be embarrassed,"" the user wrote.  Meanwhile, one user attacked Ryleigh and others who have mocked Swift, while also expressing frustration over the idea that Swift fans would be characterized by the attacks in defense of their pop idol.  ""What a (add expletive here). Honestly this kind of crap creates mean behavior — then people blame the Swifties. This is crap FROM crap,"" the user wrote.  Spector is only the latest current or former partner of an NFL player to be attacked by Swift fans. Just before the season started, fans attacked one of Swift's friends and the wife of Kelce's teammate.  Brittany Mahomes, who is married to Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and is pregnant with their third child, was attacked by Swift fans in August just for liking a post on Donald Trump's Instagram account.

(David Eulitt/Getty Images) Brittany was linked to other showings of support for Trump, and Swift made headlines for not sitting in the same suites at Chiefs games ahead of the election earlier in the season. It made Mahomes a frequent target of Swift fans, as the wife and mother made multiple social media responses to the hate comments she was getting, and even had to seek advice from her husband on dealing with the attention, she said on the ""Whoop"" podcast Aug. 28.  ""Having him to help me get through it has helped a lot because he is very good at managing those things and blocking people out and doing all that type of stuff,"" she said. ""Having him beside me and kind of guiding me, coaching me through it has helped a ton. I think that’s kind of gotten to where we are at now. ""I think the main thing he always told me is like, ‘Stop caring about what people think, especially the people that don’t even know you,’"" she said. ""And so I think social media used to get me a lot, and now it’s just like, honestly, I don’t give a f--- about what people have to say about me anymore."" Swift fans also attacked Kelce's ex-girlfriend Kayla Nicole and WNBA star Angel Reese after Reese hosted Nicole in a podcast episode in early October.  Nicole went into detail about her romantic relationship with Kelce and its aftermath. ""We’ve seen each other in public spaces before, but it’s – I think that we’re both aware of the nature of his new situation that there’s just no room really for us to communicate or acknowledge each other publicly without it being spun into something crazy,"" Nicole said of Kelce and his new relationship with Swift.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Taylor Swift with Travis Kelce during the Eras tour. (Gareth Cattermole/TAS24/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management ) Nicole also claimed she has received hate since Kelce began to date Swift.  ""I would be lying if I said that that level of hate and just, like, online chaos doesn’t impact me,"" Nicole said. ""It does, even to this day. You can go to my most recent post, and it will be people debating each other why I am worthless, and I’ll never be a talented person and I have no career."" The comments ignited a controversy on social media, with some defending Nicole and sympathizing with her. The criticism against Reese for hosting Kelce's ex prompted a response from the Sky rookie days later. ""Hating pays too,"" Reese wrote in a post on X with emoji of painting toenails. Now, Spector has joined the Swift army rogues gallery. With a potential playoff matchup between the two teams once January comes around, it could be just the beginning of Spector's reputation among the singer's fan base.  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Let’s call it like it is: The Dallas Cowboys are in shambles at this point in the season following their fifth straight loss as the Houston Texans walloped them at AT&T Stadium.  The metal sheet falling from the stadium’s roof before the game could be a metaphor for what’s going on in ""Jerry’s World,"" and some of the team’s greats said so publicly as they watched their in-state rival have their way on the road Monday night.  ""I’m the [Cowboys] to the heart.

He thinks Sanders could be just like Jim Harbaugh, who has rejuvenated the Los Angeles Chargers in his inaugural season with them.  Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman, who spent his entire 12-year career in Dallas, was on the call for ESPN’s broadcast alongside Joe Buck, and he thinks McCarthy’s on his way out the door.  ESPN STAR GETTING ‘VERY, VERY WORRIED’ ABOUT JERRY JONES, HAS JOE BIDEN IN MIND ""Mike McCarthy’s a good football coach,"" Aikman explained, per Awful Announcing.

It’s hard to imagine him getting one now."" It was always a question whether McCarthy would be coming back to the Cowboys after this season, as he and Dak Prescott went into the offseason in the final year of their respective contracts.  Prescott, the team’s franchise quarterback, was awarded with an extension, making him the highest-paid quarterback in the league before Week 1.

Cooper Rush has started the last two games for Dallas, but the offense has scored 16 total points.  Jones was asked whether McCarthy is losing the team’s confidence, but he dismissed those concerns.  ""That losing the team stuff, that’s so overblown,"" Jones said, via ESPN. ""These guys are so, first of all, they’re natural competitors. Secondly, they’re so proud of the fact that they are professional and disappointed in maybe the way they executed the play, but that’s not anything that’s brother or first cousin to give up.… Everybody’s certainly disappointed, but that’s a big difference in not knowing that you got to put the foot in front of the other to go.""

Successful football betting requires you to set aside emotions and focus on cold, hard facts. It’s not about who you want to win; it’s about who’s most likely to win based on data. Let me tell you a story. My friend, James, was an avid Manchester United fan. Every weekend, he’d bet on them to win, even during their worst seasons. Week after week, he’d lose, blaming referees or unlucky breaks. One day, I sat him down and showed him some basic stats: form, injuries, and head-to-head records. He was stunned to see how often he was ignoring glaring red flags. When he started betting with his brain instead of his heart, he not only stopped losing money—he started making it. So, how do you make this shift? Start with research. The more you know, the better your chances. Analyze team form, player injuries, weather conditions, and even referee tendencies. Yes, referees can play a bigger role than you think. For instance, if you know a particular ref is card-happy, you might consider betting on the number of yellow or red cards in a game rather than the result. Betting is like assembling a puzzle; every piece of information matters. Next, let’s talk about odds. They’re not just random numbers thrown out by bookmakers—they reflect probabilities and influence your potential profits. Always compare odds across multiple betting platforms to ensure you’re getting the best value. If you’re consistently taking low odds because it feels “safer,” you’re leaving money on the table. And remember, underdogs can and do win, but you need to pick your spots. It’s about identifying when the odds on a favorite are too low to bother with or when an underdog’s odds offer exceptional value. Now, here’s where the discipline comes in. You need a bankroll management strategy. Betting isn’t about “going big or going home.” It’s a marathon, not a sprint. Decide on a budget you’re willing to risk—money you’re comfortable losing—and stick to it. A common rule is to only wager 1-2% of your bankroll on a single bet. That way, even if you hit a losing streak (and you will), you won’t go broke. Another pro tip? Specialize. Trying to bet on every league and every match is a rookie mistake. Focus on one or two leagues you’re familiar with. Maybe it’s the English Premier League or Spain’s La Liga. When you narrow your focus, you gain a deeper understanding of the teams, players, and trends, which gives you an edge. Accumulators, or parlays, might seem tempting because of their high potential payouts, but they’re also traps for the inexperienced. Combining multiple bets into one increases the odds exponentially, but it also drastically lowers your chances of winning. Sure, that 10-leg accumulator looks exciting, but realistically, sticking to single bets or doubles is a safer and more profitable route. Finally, don’t underestimate the power of betting markets beyond just match outcomes. Options like “both teams to score,” “over/under goals,” or “first goalscorer” can sometimes offer better value than a straightforward win/loss bet. If a game is between two teams with shaky defenses, betting on both teams to score might be smarter than picking a winner. At the end of the day, betting on football isn’t about hitting the jackpot with every game; it’s about consistent, calculated plays that add up over time. Treat it like an investment rather than a gamble. The more you learn, the more you’ll earn—or at least, the less you’ll lose. So, the next time you place a bet, do it with purpose. Don’t just hope for a win—plan for it. And when you see those profits rolling in, trust me, it’ll feel just as thrilling as a last-minute goal.",2024-11-19,unknown,29.478,credible,1,0,0.68,0.32

A Clear Guide for Newbies,https://sportsweez.com/how-does-sports-betting-work-a-clear-guide-for-newbies/,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 16:22:13 +0000","Sports betting can feel like stepping into a whirlwind of jargon, numbers, and excitement, but it’s not as complicated as it seems.

These are just [&#8230;]","Sports betting can feel like stepping into a whirlwind of jargon, numbers, and excitement, but it’s not as complicated as it seems. At its core, sports betting is simply placing a wager on the outcome of a sports event. Will your favorite team win? Will the star player score the first touchdown? These are just a few of the bets you can make, but the beauty of sports betting lies in its variety. Let me break it down for you in a way that makes sense—like we’re sitting in a bustling sportsbook, sipping on overpriced drinks and poring over the odds. The first thing you need to know is that sports betting revolves around odds. Odds are essentially the bookmaker’s way of saying how likely something is to happen. Think of it like a friend saying, “I’ll bet you 5-to-1 the underdog wins.” If your friend’s right, they’ll get paid five times their wager. Bookmakers do the same thing, but they’re way savvier than your buddy with his casual bets. They calculate odds based on meticulous data, trends, and public sentiment, so the house always has a slight edge. Let’s get to the types of bets. The simplest and most popular is the moneyline bet. Here, you’re just picking who will win the game. If Team A is favored, their odds might look like -150. That minus sign means you’d need to bet $150 to win $100. On the flip side, if Team B is the underdog, their odds might be +200. That plus sign means if you bet $100, you’d win $200. Simple enough, right? Now, here’s where it gets fun—or complicated, depending on how you see it. Enter point spreads. This is the great equalizer in sports betting, where the underdog gets a little boost to level the playing field. If the spread is -7.5 for the favorite, they need to win by 8 or more points for your bet to cash in. The underdog, meanwhile, can lose by up to 7 points, and you’d still win. Point spreads make even lopsided matchups worth watching, especially if you’re clutching your bet slip. But it doesn’t stop there. The over/under bet, also known as a totals bet, is perfect for those who don’t care who wins. Bookmakers set a number for the total points scored by both teams, and you bet whether the actual total will be over or under that figure. Imagine a basketball game with a line set at 220.5. You’re glued to the screen, tallying every basket, hoping the game ends with 221 or more for your “over” bet to hit. And let’s not forget about parlays, the wild card of sports betting. This is where you combine multiple bets into one. The catch? You need to win all of them to cash in. It’s high risk, high reward—kind of like ordering sushi at a gas station. The real magic of sports betting, though, is the live betting scene. This is where you can place bets during the game as it unfolds. Odds shift in real-time, creating a roller-coaster of adrenaline and decision-making. Imagine watching a soccer match where the underdog scores first. Suddenly, the odds change, and you decide to throw some money on the favored team to make a comeback. It’s as if you’re playing the game alongside the athletes. Now, let’s talk about the elephant in the room: strategy. Sure, betting on your favorite team every week is fun, but it’s not exactly a winning formula. Successful bettors study the stats, track injuries, and follow the money to see where the big wagers are being placed. It’s not about luck—it’s about making educated guesses. Some even swear by bankroll management, which is just a fancy way of saying, “Don’t blow all your cash on one game.” So, how do you get started? These days, it’s easier than ever. Sportsbooks, both online and in-person, make signing up a breeze. Just remember, they’re not in it to lose money, so approach every bet knowing there’s a reason the odds are what they are. And if you’re using an app, you’ll find they offer bonuses and free bets to lure you in. Use those to your advantage, but don’t let the bells and whistles distract you from making smart choices. At the end of the day, sports betting is about amplifying the thrill of the game. It’s not just about money—it’s about the rush of seeing your underdog team defy the odds or the satisfaction of nailing a parlay no one thought was possible. Just remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint. Bet responsibly, know when to walk away, and most importantly, enjoy the ride. Because whether you win or lose, it’s all part of the game.",2024-11-19,unknown,-20.05957225433525,uncredible,0,0,0.58,0.42

In 2024, sports betting apps have hit a new level of sophistication, offering seamless experiences, real-time updates, and features that make you feel like a seasoned professional—even if you’re just starting out. So, here’s a breakdown of the 10 best apps to bet on sports like a pro in 2024 that combine functionality, trustworthiness, and excitement. First up, DraftKings Sportsbook continues to reign supreme. With an intuitive interface and endless options for live betting, it feels like your personal Las Vegas in your pocket. The app doesn’t just let you bet—it immerses you in the stats, odds, and analysis, making you feel smarter than you probably are. My buddy Kevin, who thought a parlay was some fancy drink, swears by DraftKings now. He says the app practically taught him the ropes, and he even cashed out on a multi-leg parlay during last year’s Super Bowl. Then there’s FanDuel Sportsbook, a rival that’s neck and neck with DraftKings. FanDuel makes betting as smooth as swiping on your favorite dating app, except the stakes are much higher. The “Same Game Parlay” feature lets you stack bets within a single event, which is basically like hitting the sports-betting jackpot if you play your cards right. It’s no wonder fans and experts alike love its sleek design and powerful features. For those who live by numbers, BetMGM is your ticket to precision betting. Imagine getting in-depth insights paired with competitive odds, all wrapped up in a glamorous package. I tried it once during the NBA playoffs, and let me tell you, I felt like I was strategizing with the sharpest minds in sports. Their “Edit My Bet” feature is a lifesaver when your gut suddenly says, “Wait, that was a bad call.” Looking for a classic? Caesars Sportsbook is a name you can trust. What sets it apart is its legendary rewards program. Betting here isn’t just about the money—you’re racking up points that can be used for real-life perks like hotel stays and dining. If you’ve ever wanted your sports obsession to literally pay off, this is where you should be placing your bets. When we talk about versatility, PointsBet deserves a spotlight. Known for its unique “Points Betting” system, this app is a thrill-seeker’s dream. The more accurate your bet, the higher your payout. My cousin tried it during the World Cup and was glued to his screen for hours. It’s a rush that regular betting doesn’t quite match. Barstool Sportsbook appeals to the unapologetically bold. If you love the banter, community vibes, and edgy sports commentary, Barstool’s app is the perfect match. It’s like betting with your loudest, most obnoxious friend who somehow always knows who’s going to win. For cryptocurrency fans, Stake.com is rewriting the rules. This app is all about betting in Bitcoin and other digital currencies, making it a standout for tech-savvy bettors. It’s a whole different vibe, but in 2024, this kind of innovation is what keeps things exciting. If speed is your thing, Bet365 is the king of live betting. Watching a game and placing bets in real time with lightning-fast updates? Yes, please. It’s an adrenaline rush that’ll keep you on your toes, especially when every second counts. Want a sportsbook that feels like it was made just for you? Unibet specializes in user customization. It’s not the flashiest app, but it knows how to make the experience personal and smooth, which is all you really need when you’re in it for the long haul. Last but not least, WynnBET combines elegance and simplicity. This app doesn’t try to overwhelm you with features—it focuses on doing the basics perfectly. Reliable, straightforward, and effective, it’s for those who like their betting with no frills, just thrills. Each of these apps brings something unique to the table, and the best choice for you depends on your style and priorities. Are you the data-driven analyst? The thrill-seeker? The loyalty rewards junkie?

The allure of this industry is strong, as sports fans everywhere are eager for tips on how to beat the odds. If you’re serious about turning sports insight into profit, here’s a bold, practical guide to launching your own sports betting business and making real money by selling picks. First things first: know the game better than your competitors. If you’re jumping into this with just a casual knowledge of sports, stop right there. To make a business out of sports picks, you need to be the person who knows everything from a team’s current form to the nitty-gritty of player stats, recent injuries, and even weather conditions that can affect gameplay. In short, you need to do your homework and then some, because the paying customers who come to you for picks aren’t interested in general knowledge; they want precision, accuracy, and proven results. Next, let’s talk about selecting your niche. It’s tempting to go broad, offering picks on every major sport, but specialization can be your secret weapon. For example, maybe you’re an expert on college basketball or have an uncanny knack for predicting tennis outcomes. Focusing on one sport or league, at least in the beginning, allows you to build credibility in a specific area, giving your clients confidence that you’re a true expert rather than a generalist. Once you know your sport inside and out, start building your brand. Sports picks are often sold on reputation as much as they are on actual results. Think about creating a name that conveys trustworthiness and expertise. Set up a basic website with a professional look, because, let’s be real—no one’s going to pay for picks from a website that looks like it was designed overnight. Invest in clean graphics, easy navigation, and compelling content that explains why your picks are worth paying for. With your website in place, it’s time to establish a track record. Here’s where patience comes in. Before anyone hands over cash for your picks, they’ll want to see proof that you’re capable of delivering. Start by offering some free picks on your website, in social media groups, or on betting forums to showcase your insights and win rate. Post results, be transparent about your record, and don’t be shy about showing off when you’re on a hot streak—people love seeing a winning track record. Now, let’s dive into pricing your picks. This is where a lot of new betting entrepreneurs stumble. Do not price yourself out of the market by charging too much too soon, but don’t go too low, either, or people might think you’re not serious. Start with an affordable monthly subscription plan or a pay-per-pick model. Consider offering a few different tiers, like daily picks, weekend-only picks, or VIP access for those who want the absolute best you’ve got. You might also want to set up a trial period for new customers, giving them a chance to see that your picks pay off before they fully commit. Once you have paying clients, your customer service skills become just as important as your sports knowledge. This is a trust-based business, and people want to feel like you have their back. Respond quickly to inquiries, maintain transparency about wins and losses, and offer refunds or free picks when necessary. Building a loyal customer base means establishing real relationships with the people who rely on you for their betting decisions. Marketing your picks is the next big step. Social media and influencer marketing can be goldmines in this industry. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are flooded with betting enthusiasts, so create content that engages this audience. Share stats, post highlights, and get people talking about your picks. Running giveaways or posting predictions for free every now and then can be a great way to bring in followers who could later become paying clients. Another marketing tool? Email newsletters. People who sign up are already interested, so send them a mix of free content and exclusive picks offers. It’s also smart to leverage platforms where betting enthusiasts hang out—forums, YouTube channels, and even TikTok, where a short, punchy video with a big claim (like “top three NBA picks to watch this week!”) could go viral among sports fans. As you build credibility, ask happy clients for testimonials and post them on your site and social media. Positive reviews can be more persuasive than any ad campaign. Now here’s the tough part: keep improving your picks. The betting industry is brutal; if your picks don’t perform, word gets around fast. Stay informed, follow changes in team rosters, understand new betting trends, and invest in tools or software that might give you an edge. Some successful pick-sellers subscribe to advanced analytics platforms or even consult with data scientists to refine their predictions. Lastly, consider expanding your services once you’ve gained traction. For instance, if you start by specializing in NBA picks, you might eventually branch out into NFL or even niche markets like esports. Offering various picks not only attracts a wider audience but can also stabilize your revenue as seasons change. However, only expand when you can commit to quality—every pick you sell needs to be backed by real insight. Starting a sports betting business and selling picks is not for the faint of heart, but for those willing to commit to the grind, the rewards are within reach. Be patient, be knowledgeable, and above all, be trustworthy. It’s not just about selling picks; it’s about selling success, and with the right moves, you’ll be well on your way to a profitable betting business.",2024-11-19,unknown,29.478,credible,1,0,0.5,0.5

The Canadians secured a narrow 1-0 victory in the first leg, setting up a decisive clash as they aim to reach the semi-finals of the competition. Canada have been one of the form teams in CONCACAF over the past year, winning 13 of their last 16 competitive matches. They reached the semi-finals of the 2023 Copa America, narrowly missing out on a bronze medal, and will be eager to make amends by advancing in the Nations League. Suriname, on the other hand, have struggled against the region’s powerhouses, losing all six of their previous meetings with Canada, the USA, and Mexico while scoring just once. However, they did managed to claim a narrow loss in the first leg of this tie, showcasing their ability to frustrate the opposition. Canada come into this match unbeaten in their last four games, winning three of those fixtures. They have kept two clean sheets in their previous three competitive outings, highlighting their defensive solidity. Suriname have been more inconsistent, winning two, drawing one, and losing two of their last five matches in all competitions. In the three previous competitive meetings between Canada and Suriname, the Canadians have emerged victorious on each occasion, outscoring their opponents by a combined margin of 7-1. Canada will be without the services of star winger Alphonso Davies, who is sidelined due to fatigue. However, they can still call upon the likes of Jonathan David and Cyle Larin, who have 30 goals each for the national team. Suriname have made several changes to their starting lineup, with Stefano Denswil, Justin Lonwijk, and Djevencio van der Kust all earning their first senior call-ups. Crepeau; Ahmed, Johnston, Waterman, Bombito, Laryea; Eustaquio, Choiniere, Shaffelburg; Larin, David Vaessen; Van Gelderen, Abena, Denswil, Haps; Malone, Pinas; Becker, Paal, Lonwijk; Vlijter Canada’s experience and quality should prove too much for Suriname in this second leg, despite the visitors’ impressive performance in the first match. The Canadians have a strong defensive record and will be motivated to atone for their disappointment at last year’s Nations League. While Suriname may pose a threat on the counter-attack, we expect Canada to control the tempo and secure a comfortable 2-0 victory to advance to the semi-finals. – Canada to win

The two South American rivals are separated by just three points in the table, making this an important clash in the race to secure a spot at the 2026 World Cup. Colombia have had a mixed campaign so far, winning 5, drawing 4, and losing 2 of their 11 matches. They suffered a disappointing 3-2 defeat against Uruguay in their last outing, despite a late fightback. Liverpool’s Luis Diaz has been in fine form, scoring 16 goals for his country, while Jhon Duran of Aston Villa has also impressed. However, the form of James Rodriguez has been a concern. Ecuador, on the other hand, are unbeaten in their last 4 matches, including a 4-0 thrashing of Bolivia in their previous game. Gonzalo Plata netted a brace, while veteran striker Enner Valencia and Alan Minda also got on the scoresheet. The Tricolor have the best defensive record in the group, conceding just 4 goals in 11 matches. Colombia’s recent form has been inconsistent, with 2 wins, 1 draw, and 2 losses in their last 5 matches. The defeat against Uruguay was particularly heartbreaking, as they conceded a late winner after leveling the scores in the 96th minute.

They have won 23 matches, while Ecuador have won 13, with 13 draws. In their last 5 encounters, Colombia have won 2, Ecuador have won 1, and there has been 2 draws. Colombia have no new injury concerns following the Uruguay match, and head coach Lorenzo is expected to name an unchanged side.

Ecuador’s defensive solidity and the goal-scoring threat of Enner Valencia make them a tough opponent, but Colombia’s attacking firepower, led by Diaz and Duran, could prove to be the difference. Ultimately, a draw seems the most likely outcome, as both teams look to secure a valuable point in their quest for World Cup qualification. – Match Result: Draw

Brazil have underwhelmed in their World Cup qualifying campaign so far, managing five wins, two draws, and four defeats from 11 matches. Their recent 1-1 draw with Venezuela was a disappointment, though Raphinha’s opener gave them the lead before the hosts equalized shortly after the restart. Brazil’s last two matches against Uruguay have also ended in defeat, including a penalty shootout loss in the 2024 Copa America quarter-finals. Uruguay, on the other hand, enter this contest in confident mood after a dramatic 3-2 victory over Colombia in their previous outing. Manuel Ugarte’s late winner in the 11th minute of stoppage time saw them leapfrog Brazil into second place in the standings, just three points behind leaders Argentina. Marcelo Bielsa’s side have won five, drawn four, and lost two of their 11 qualifiers so far. Brazil’s form has been inconsistent, with two wins, two draws, and two defeats in their last six matches across all competitions. Uruguay, meanwhile, have shown more resilience, recording three draws and three wins in their previous six outings. Brazil and Uruguay have faced each other 82 times, with Brazil winning 39 of those encounters, Uruguay victorious in 21, and 22 matches ending in a draw. However, Uruguay have emerged victorious in the last two meetings between the sides. Brazil will be without the suspended Vanderson, while Guilherme Arana has withdrawn from the squad due to an ankle injury.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Colorado Rockies star third baseman Kris Bryant was reportedly among many who had their cars stolen by a car theft ring, but after a multistate investigation, it has since been recovered.  Bryant’s 2023 Lamborghini Huracan was stolen from his Cherry Hills Village residence on Oct. 2, Cherry Hills Village Police Department tells FOX31 Denver. Bryant was reportedly trying to ship his vehicle to Las Vegas for the offseason. However, when the car failed to arrive at his residence there, an investigation began. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Colorado Rockies right fielder Kris Bryant warms up before a game against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. (Matt Marton-USA TODAY Sports) According to FOX31 Denver, detectives found that the vehicle transport company that was supposed to bring his Lamborghini to Las Vegas was a fraud.  It was a business email compromise, which allowed suspects to arrange unauthorized vehicle transports.  2025 MLB FREE-AGENT RUMORS: 2 FAVORITES EMERGE FOR CORBIN BURNES On Oct. 7, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department’s VIPER Auto Theft Team and Homeland Security Investigations successfully recovered Bryant’s vehicle while arresting multiple suspects in the process.  The investigation found that two other vehicles were stolen as well as multiple fraudulent VIN packages, key fobs, fake registration papers and more. One of the stolen vehicles other than Bryant’s came from California.  ""This case underscores the Cherry Hills Village Police Department’s commitment to protecting the community from sophisticated criminal schemes,"" Chief Jason Lyons said, per FOX31 Denver. ""Through the diligent work of CHVPD’s Crime Analyst, Detectives, Officers and collaborative partnerships with national and local agencies, stolen property was returned to its rightful owner, and suspects were brought to justice."" Bryant grew up in Las Vegas and usually spends his offseasons there. The 32-year-old has been with the Rockies for the past three seasons.  Colorado Rockies first baseman Kris Bryant after the 10th inning against the Oakland Athletics at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. (Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports) Bryant, a four-time All-Star during his time with the Chicago Cubs, came up to the big leagues in blazing fashion, winning Rookie of the Year in 2015 after hitting .275/.369/.488 with 26 homers and 99 RBI over 151 games.  Then the 2016 season was one Cubs fans will never forget as Bryant helped lead the way to a World Series victory, the franchise’s first since 1908, snapping a century-long curse. Bryant won NL MVP that season, slashing .292/.385/.554 with 39 homers and 102 RBI over 155 games.  Bryant was eventually traded to the San Francisco Giants during the 2021 season before ultimately signing before the 2022 campaign with the Rockies for $182 million over seven years.  Colorado Rockies designated hitter Kris Bryant reacts after a pitch in the 10th inning against the Philadelphia Phillies at Coors Field.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. This week’s NFL slate wasn’t a particularly good outing for kickers across the league, including one of the greatest of all time.  Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker hasn’t been his usual elite self this season, and his worst game couldn’t have come at a worse time against their AFC North rival, the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Tucker missed two field goals in what eventually became a deciding factor in the 18-16 loss for Baltimore, giving Pittsburgh possession of the AFC North throne for the moment.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Baltimore Ravens place kicker Justin Tucker kicks a field goal against the Pittsburgh Steelers during the third quarter at Acrisure Stadium. (Charles LeClaire-Imagn Images) After the game, Tucker was asked if the field conditions weren’t to his liking, to which he didn’t make an excuse.  However, he did mention it wasn’t the best conditions considering Pitt’s football team played Clemson in their college football matchup on Saturday before the Ravens and Steelers kicked off. ""I wouldn’t say the surface was an issue, but it wasn’t ideal,"" Tucker told reporters. ""That’s something that we make it a point to account for by going out there in pre-game warmups and getting our feet under us, figuring out what the wind may be doing. But we’ve dealt with that plenty of times here, elsewhere, at home. Then, throughout the course of the game, the most action takes place in between the hashes, and it naturally gets chewed up."" STEELERS TAKE COMMAND OF AFC NORTH WIN WITH OVER RAVENS As Tucker says, he’s not making any excuses, but social media didn’t take that as such considering Steelers kicker Chris Boswell was a perfect 6-for-6 on his field goal attempts, which ultimately won the Steelers the game.  Tucker was able to drill a 54-yard field goal to keep the Ravens in the divisional bout, but the 34-year-old has already missed six kicks this season, and he’s only missed a total of seven in a single season during his career.  Baltimore Ravens place kicker Justin Tucker reacts to a missed field goal against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Rory McIlroy has won golf majors, but his latest win brought tears to his eyes for numerous reasons, including his personal life, with him and his wife, Erica, almost divorcing.  ""It means a lot,"" McIlroy said, via Sky Sports, after winning the DP World Tour’s Race to Dubai tournament for the third straight year. Erica and their daughter, Poppy, were at the course with him.  ""I’ve been through a lot this year – personally, professionally. It feels like the fitting end to 2024.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Former NFL star Shawne Merriman was among the supposed 60 million viewers who tuned into Netflix to watch Jake Paul’s unanimous decision victory over Mike Tyson. Merriman was also among those who were left perplexed by the production’s quality. With an overload of viewers who streamed onto the platform around 8 p.m. ET, many customers experienced buffering issues. Additionally, the broadcast itself was plagued by strange cutaways, Tyson’s full moon and mics dropping out at the most inopportune time. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Shawne Merriman is the founder of Lights Out Xtreme Fighting and Lights Out Sports TV. (Robert Hanashiro, USAT, USA Today via Imagn Content Services, LLC) Unlike most viewers who watched the fight, Merriman has experience in producing live sports television. Lights Out Xtreme Fighting, which the former San Diego Chargers linebacker founded, streams live on Lights Out Sports TV – the free channel he also founded. The questionable production sparked worries among NFL fans, who worry what their experience will be like when Netflix streams two Christmas Day games. Down Detector said it had logged more than 85,000 complaints from users having issues during the fight. ""They can get away with what happened with the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fight. They cannot get away with the NFL because the one thing about the NFL, their product is No. 1,"" Merriman told Fox News Digital in an interview on Monday. ""That shield, the look, the graphics packages, their transitioning from in and out of spots is pristine. ""You cannot under no circumstances botch an NFL broadcast and they have to work out all those kinks now and get the right crew there because the NFL is not going to tolerate that. The NFL’s brand is too big and one thing about the NFL, what we know and love is the production quality is at the highest standards you can get.""

(Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Merriman said a ton of stress testing with equipment occurs before going live. He made clear there need to be backups to backups in case anything unforeseen happens during the live broadcast. He suspected Netflix may not have had the right team in place for a live sporting event. ""It just seemed like they had a mixture of some outside people when it came to directors and producers while there was a lot of in house who didn’t understand how to go about live sports,"" he theorized. ""Live sports in general is tough, tough business and that’s why you got these select few that do a great job and been doing a great job at it for a long time."" Merriman said he produces a four-hour show for his MMA promotion and understood the difficulty some of the Netflix crew went through during the fight. The former NFL star added he expected to get it right in time for the NFL – and later WWE – to come to the streaming service. ""They will get it right. I wasn’t too up on Amazon’s production when they first started ‘Thursday Night Football’ either,"" he said. ""You can tell the difference and they got it right.

Instead, it was President-elect Donald Trump and the dance he’s done during his campaign rallies. Support for Trump may have trickled from the sports world in the days leading up to the election, but it really exploded over the weekend. While there was no Trump dance at the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fight, Paul and Tyson both expressed their support for him in the past.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Pro wrestling legend Eric Bischoff helped change the industry in the 1990s, but there was one storyline that didn’t pass the sniff test, much to the former executive producer’s chagrin.  Bischoff told Fox News Digital in a recent interview there was at least one storyline he had pitched to a Turner Sports higher-up that didn’t go over so well. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Eric Bischoff (Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images for SiriusXM/File) The former World Championship Wrestling (WCW) president explained he was a pilot and was certified to fly ""high performance complex aircraft"" and got this wild idea in 1998. ""I flew all over the country. I love flying, and there was a point in time I was down in Arizona for some reason and flying around, I thought, ‘Wow, wouldn’t it be interesting if I faked my own death?’ Meaning, wouldn’t it be interesting if I, you know, let it be known that I was traveling around southern Arizona and checking out some of the sights and somehow wandered off into Mexican airspace and apparently ran out of gas or something and ended up crashing. They couldn’t find the plane or me. ""I wanted to go with that. This was like a month or two before Halloween Havoc, and I was going to make my own death in a plane crash and then appear as a ghost of myself at Halloween Havoc in Las Vegas. I was so excited about it.""

(Jason Kempin/Getty Images) Bischoff said he made a short list of people he would tell that the crash angle was all just a part of a storyline he concocted, including his family members. He said he knew he needed to tell Turner Sports that he was planning this idea because he was the president of a publicly traded company. So, Bischoff explained he had a meeting with then-Turner Sports executive Harvey Schiller. Bischoff explained that Schiller rarely, if ever, turned down any of Bischoff’s ideas. ""I went to Harvey and I laid it out to him, and he wasn’t impressed,"" Bischoff told Fox News Digital. ""He felt I was nuts. But it wouldn’t have worked. It wouldn’t have worked in any other business. But it would have worked in wrestling. ""I had it really well-thought-out. I wish I would have been able to pull that one off, but it just wasn’t in the cards."" Years later, Bischoff finds himself back in the creative spotlight.

991,Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Fox News Digital Sports' college football winners and losers: Week 12,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/fox-news-digital-sports-college-football-winners-losers-week-12,"Mon, 18 Nov 2024 04:00:02 -0500",There were plenty of eye-opening plays in Week 12 of the college football season. But who won and lost Saturday? Take a look at the latest interation of winners and losers.,"Deion Sanders talks about the strong chemistry between Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter, comparing it to the connection Michael Irvin had with Troy Aikman during their playing days. College football fans faced no real surprises in the 12th week of the 2024 season. Oregon handled a test from Big Ten Conference opponent Wisconsin, while Ohio State, Texas, Penn State, Alabama and Notre Dame each took care of business. The upset of the weekend came from Kansas as they held BYU to 13 points and won the game 17-13. It was the Cougars’ first loss of the season and added to the questions about just how good they are in an appreciably weaker Big 12 Conference. Georgia also made a statement with its win over Tennessee. The Bulldogs were on the outside of the College Football Playoff bracket when last week’s rankings were released. Georgia is likely to be back in the field when the rankings are released again. Here are some more winners and losers from the week. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Kansas wide receivers Quentin Skinner, left, and Trevor Wilson celebrate a recovered fumble during the second half of an NCAA college football game Saturday, Nov. 16, 2024, in Provo, Utah. (AP Photo/Rick Egan) Florida: Well, the Florida Gators have at least bought into head coach Billy Napier. But the Gators did a solid for SEC teams still fighting for a spot in the conference title game. Saturday night in ""The Swamp"" turned into a nightmare for LSU in its 27-16 defeat, which was its third-consecutive loss. The Gators defense sacked Tigers QB Garrett Nussmeier seven times, making the Brian Kelly offense continue to look like a mess. Coming off a 49-17 curb-stomping last week against Texas, it was DJ Lagway that returned at QB and led Florida to the upset win. There are major problems in Baton Rouge and Gainesville. But this weekend, it was the Gators that took advantage of the situation, ending any chance the Tigers had of making the college football playoffs.  Kansas: For the second time in consecutive weeks, the Kansas Jayhawks caused havoc within the Big 12 by beating No. 6 BYU and handing the Cougars their first loss of the season, throwing a wrench into the conference title game picture. Last week, it was Jalon Daniels leading Kansas to a win over No. 17 Iowa State, and now he has done it again, beating ranked opponents in back-to-back weeks for the first time in program history. Now Kansas needs to win its last two regular-season games to make a bowl. But as we've seen in the past two weeks, the Jayhawks don’t have a problem playing the role of ""spoiler"" in the conference. Georgia: The 2024 season has been filled with ups and downs for Georgia quarterback Carson Beck. But on Saturday night against Tennessee, the senior quarterback delivered one of his better performances. Most importantly, he avoided turning the ball over. Beck finished the game with two touchdowns and helped lift the Bulldogs to a 31-17 win over the seventh-ranked Volunteers. The win was critical for Georgia because a third loss on the season would likely have ended the team’s hopes of making it to the College Football Playoff. Georgia still has some noticeable areas where they need to improve if they want to make a deep run in the playoffs, presuming the committee grants them a spot. However, head coach Kirby Smart has a championship pedigree, which could give the Bulldogs an advantage down the stretch. Colorado wide receiver Travis Hunter jokes with teammates as he waits with quarterback Shedeur Sanders to do a television interview after an NCAA college football game against Utah on Saturday, Nov. 16, 2024, in Boulder, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) Colorado: Deion Sanders and company are just on the fringes of potentially qualifying for the expanded playoff, and they'll need more wins like the one they got on Saturday against Utah to get there. With an offensive explosion and games against Kansas and Oklahoma State coming up, Sanders' team needs to be at least as good as they were on Saturday to get there. Ohio State: Ohio State has the inside track to get back to the Big 10 championship game. Their biggest challengers will be their next two games against a surprise underdog story in undefeated Indiana and a historic rival in Michigan, which has fallen well below the level of beating Ohio State the last three seasons. It's all in front of the Buckeyes. Arizona State: One of the biggest upsets of the weekend was the Sun Devils taking down No. 16 Kansas State, 24-14, putting them in a position to potentially go after a conference title. It’s been a quiet run for ASU,  a team hoping that either BYU or Colorado has a few down weeks upcoming. Travis Hunter: The two-way Colorado Buffaloes star continues to put together quite the stat sheet for a potential Heisman Trophy after his performance in the 49-24 win over Utah. Hunter had 55 yards rushing, including a touchdown on one of his carries, and he hauled in an interception while he was playing cornerback. In 10 games this season, Hunter has totaled 900 yards from scrimmage, 10 touchdowns and three interceptions. The future first-round pick can truly do it all, and the Heisman might come his way because of it. Tennessee: The Vols entered Saturday night's game against Georgia controlling its own destiny when it came to the playoffs. But after Georgia defeated them 31-17, Tennessee must now rely on others to get them into the postseason. One of the biggest problems for this Josh Heupel football team is that the offense looks nothing like what we've come to expect, and not scoring in the second half will obviously lead to problems. It's not as if Georgia is the top-tier team we've seen in year's past, but Tennessee made Carson Beck look like a Heisman Trophy candidate with its defensive performance against the Bulldogs. This was one that the Vols needed, but after leading 10-0 in the first quarter, Georgia went on a 31-7 run to finish the game.  Tennessee head coach Josh Heupel yells to an official during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Georgia on Saturday, Nov. 16, 2024, in Athens. (AP Photo/John Bazemore) BYU: The Cougars have been playing with fire over the last month, and it finally came back to bite them on Saturday night in Provo, Utah. BYU had 23 first downs compared to 13 for Kansas, but that still wasn't enough, and now the Cougars are going to feel the heat from the playoff committee. Now, BYU has to travel to Arizona State next weekend, with the Sun Devils beating Kansas State on Saturday. This could turn into a nightmare scenario for the Cougars if they were to lose again next weekend. But with the emergence of Colorado, it's been trending toward Deion Sanders and the Buffaloes taking the Big 12 automatic bid for the college football playoff over the last few weeks. This one is coming down the stretch, and I don't trust the Cougars. South Carolina: The Gamecocks already earned what was perhaps their signature win of the season on Nov. 2 when they upset Texas A&M. But this past Saturday’s win over Missouri shows that South Carolina is a team that future opponents should be worried about. The Gamecocks could make another leap in the upcoming College Football Playoff rankings. While a berth in the SEC Championship game in Atlanta remains unlikely, coach Shane Beamer appears to have the South Carolina football program trending in the right direction. LSU: The Tigers shockingly lost to the Gators on Saturday in a devastating fourth-quarter collapse. Losing a rivalry game always hurts, but giving one away like LSU did is embarrassing, too. Brian Kelly: LSU’s frustrations boiled over after their third straight loss over the weekend, this time to an unranked Florida. Head coach Brian Kelly was spotted losing his cool on the sideline with wide receiver Chris Hilton, who some on social media speculated he called ""uncoachable."" Mayhem continued to unfold with the broadcast capturing wideout Kyren Lacy later yelling at the coach as he walked off the field following another failed drive. The latest loss means Kelly’s 10-win season streak will end this year, but it seems the Tigers have bigger problems than that.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Fox News Digital Sports college football winners and losers were compiled by the Fox News Digital Sports staff and the OutKick.com staff.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. What looked to be a Los Angeles Chargers beatdown on the Cincinnati Bengals at SoFi Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" turned into a thriller in the second half. But the Chargers were able to take down the Bengals, 34-27, behind J.K. Dobbins’ 29-yard touchdown, his second of the game.  The game was deadlocked at 27 apiece when Justin Herbert got the ball with just 45 seconds left to play, and he found Ladd McConkey on two amazing passes for a total 55 yards to get into Bengals territory.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert (10) throws against the Cincinnati Bengals during the first half at SoFi Stadium. (Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images) It seemed like the Chargers would just run it out for a game-winning field goal, but Dobbins found space and exploited it for the score.  With just seconds left to play, Joe Burrow, who battled back in the second half to make this a game, heaved a Hail Mary to Tee Higgins, but Derwin James swatted it away for the win. It was the Bengals who got on the board first in this game with a field goal, but it was truly all Chargers in the first half as Herbert got rolling quickly.  2025 NFL MOCK DRAFT: TRAVIS HUNTER, SHEDEUR SANDERS HAVE BUFFS SITTING PRETTY On the team’s second drive of the game, he needed just five plays to go 70 yards as he threw an absolute dime to tight end Will Dissly down the seam for a 29-yard touchdown to make it a 7-3 game after the extra point.  After another red zone trip for Cincinnati ended with a field goal, Herbert wowed the Chargers faithful with an off-balance dot to Quentin Johnston in the end zone for a 26-yard score. That came after finding Johnston for 22 yards and Dissly for 20 earlier in the drive.  With the Bengals going three-and-out, head coach Jim Harbaugh decided to look for the early kill shot in this game, as he went for it on fourth-and-goal from the Bengals’ one-yard line and J.K. Dobbins found the end zone to go up 21-6.  A Cameron Dicker chip shot field goal gave Los Angeles a 24-6 lead at halftime, and the Bengals looked completely dejected. But we saw their fight in the second half, as they knew this was a must-win game to keep their playoff hopes in a good spot.  Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow (9) drops back to throw a pass in the first quarter of the NFL Week 11 game between the Los Angeles Chargers and the Cincinnati Bengals at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., on Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024. The Chargers led 24-6 at halftime. (IMAGN) Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said at halftime his team needed to find the end zone when they got down in Chargers territory, and that’s exactly what they got on fourth-and-goal when Ja’Marr Chase finally got man coverage and Burrow slung a perfect slant ball to him for the score.  It brought the Bengals within two touchdowns with more than enough time to get back into the game, as long as the defense could get stops. And that’s exactly what happened, starting with a three-and-out that Burrow used to his advantage.  On another fourth-down play, Burrow got the look he wanted when Tee Higgins, returning to the fold after missing some time with injury, ran through his defenders and sprung open for a 42-yard touchdown.  Just like that, the Bengals were back in this game. Herbert and the Chargers needed to respond, as momentum was clearly shifting in this one. But on a rush play after scrambling out of the pocket, Herbert fumbled and it was scooped up by the Bengals. It was the first turnover of the game for either team, and once again, Burrow knew just what to do with it. In almost backyard football fashion, Burrow directed Chase midway through a play and his star receiver obliged, turning to his left in the end zone and Burrow put it on him for a 17-yard score, Chase’s second of the game.  Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston (1) celebrates his touchdown scored against the against the Cincinnati Bengals with quarterback Justin Herbert (10) during the first half at SoFi Stadium.

The 24-year-old winger joined Chelsea on loan in the summer with an obligation for the Blues to purchase him permanently next summer, provided [&#8230;]","Jadon Sancho has made a promising start to his season-long loan spell with Chelsea, but his long-term future remains uncertain as Manchester United prepare for a new era under manager Ruben Amorim. The 24-year-old winger joined Chelsea on loan in the summer with an obligation for the Blues to purchase him permanently next summer, provided they finish within the top 14 places in the Premier League table. The deal is understood to be worth an initial £20million, with a potential rise to £25million in add-ons. Since arriving at Stamford Bridge, Sancho has featured five times for Chelsea, making a positive impact off the bench. He provided the assist for Christopher Nkunku’s late winner against Bournemouth in September and also registered assists in the victories over West Ham and Brighton. However, the England international has been sidelined in recent weeks due to illness and a minor injury. Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has praised Sancho’s adaptation to the club’s attacking style of play, which the player himself has described as “very attractive” and well-suited to his strengths. Despite Sancho’s promising start in west London, his long-term future remains uncertain. Former Southampton and West Ham defender Jose Fonte believes the player could be given a “fresh start” at Manchester United next summer, with Amorim set to take over as the new manager at Old Trafford. Fonte said: “Jadon Sancho will get a chance to impress Ruben Amorim in the summer because it’s a fresh start and a new opportunity for everyone. Something might click between him and Amorim because he knows exactly what he wants from his players in every area of the pitch. He also likes to give the No.10s freedom to be creative and that’s exactly what Sancho needs. It could be a great opportunity for him.” Manchester United parted ways with Erik ten Hag last month after a poor start to the 2024/25 season. Amorim, who previously managed Sporting CP, will officially take charge of the Red Devils after the ongoing international break, with his first game in charge coming against Ipswich Town. If Chelsea fail to meet the criteria to make Sancho’s loan move permanent next summer, the player could potentially return to Manchester United and have the chance to impress Amorim, who is known for his attacking philosophy and ability to develop young talent. Sancho’s time at Old Trafford has been a mixed bag since his £73million move from Borussia Dortmund in 2021. After a difficult start, the winger showed glimpses of his quality, but ultimately failed to establish himself as a consistent performer under various managers. As Sancho continues to work on rediscovering his best form during his loan spell at Chelsea, the next chapter of his career remains uncertain. The player’s future could hinge on whether the Blues exercise their option to make the deal permanent or if he is given a fresh start under Amorim at Manchester United.",2024-11-18,unknown,29.478,credible,1,0,0.56,0.44

Van Persie, who joined Arsenal in 2004 and went on to win the Premier League Player of the Season award in 2011-12, made the divisive decision to leave the Gunners and join their rivals Manchester United. The move, which helped Sir Alex Ferguson’s side win the 2012-13 Premier League title, is still viewed as one of the most significant betrayals in recent football history. Now embarking on his first role as a head coach with SC Heerenveen in the Eredivisie, the 41-year-old Dutchman acknowledged the sensitivity surrounding his Arsenal exit.  “I don’t expect to work at Arsenal. I think that door is closed because of my switch to Manchester United, that is my assessment,” Van Persie stated. While the former striker admitted that “nothing is ever certain in football,” he conceded that the lingering resentment from Arsenal fans makes a potential return highly unlikely. “It is still sensitive for them, not for me. It is especially sensitive for the Arsenal fans. I have learned that planning so far ahead makes no sense at all.” Since taking charge of Heerenveen in May 2023, Van Persie has overseen a mixed start to the season, with the team currently sitting 12th in the Eredivisie table. However, the Dutchman remains focused on his current role, stating: “I really enjoy it here and I am very proud to be the coach of SC Heerenveen. I feel very welcome within the club and among the fans.” Van Persie’s departure from Arsenal in 2012 was a watershed moment in his career, as he swapped the Gunners for their bitter rivals Manchester United in a move that ultimately paid off with a Premier League title. But the scars of that controversial transfer appear to remain, making a potential homecoming to the Emirates Stadium an unlikely prospect for the former striker-turned-manager.",2024-11-18,unknown,29.478,credible,1,1,0.35,0.65

The announcement comes as Ajax prepares to celebrate its 125th anniversary on March 18th, 2025. Speaking [&#8230;]","Amsterdam, Netherlands – In a move that is sure to delight their passionate fanbase, Dutch giants Ajax have announced that their iconic classic logo will make a triumphant return as the club’s official emblem starting from the 2025/2026 season. The announcement comes as Ajax prepares to celebrate its 125th anniversary on March 18th, 2025. Speaking on the decision, CEO Menno Geelen emphasized the importance of honoring the club’s rich history and DNA. “Ajax will celebrate its 125th anniversary on March 18. The celebrations will include the announcement of the return of the classic logo. We know that the majority of our fans have cherished this wish for years, and we felt that our 125th anniversary was the perfect moment to give back the classic logo to our fans and ourselves.” Geelen went on to highlight the club’s commitment to upholding its core values and football philosophy, stating that “history has shown that we are at our best when we remain true to the Ajax DNA.” The reintroduction of the classic logo, he said, “symbolizes this commitment and serves as both a tribute to our rich history and an inspiration for the future.” The classic Ajax logo, with its distinctive red-and-white striped shield and iconic “Ajax” lettering, has long been a beloved symbol of the club. It was first introduced in 1928 and remained the club’s primary emblem until 1991, when it was replaced by a more modern design. Now, after 34 years, the classic logo will make its return, gradually being implemented across all of the club’s expressions and appearing on the match shirts once again. “The 125th anniversary feels like a very fitting moment to give the logo back to the club, the fans, and ourselves,” said Ernst Boekhorst, Chairman of the Board of Directors. “We are delighted to make such a contribution.” The return of the classic logo will be celebrated today in a sold-out Johan Cruijff ArenA, where the Ajax Legends will face the Real Madrid Legends. This symbolic event underscores the significance of the occasion for the club and its supporters. The decision to revert to the classic logo is a testament to Ajax’s deep-rooted commitment to its heritage and the unwavering loyalty of its fanbase. As the club prepares to embark on its next chapter, the return of this iconic emblem serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring spirit and tradition that have defined Ajax for over a century.",2024-11-17,unknown,35.70393973596695,credible,1,1,0.27,0.73

[&#8230;]","The battle for UEFA Nations League survival takes center stage on Monday as Poland host Scotland at the Stadion Narodowy in Warsaw. With both teams locked on four points in Group 1 of League A, the outcome of this final group stage fixture will be crucial in determining which nation avoids demotion to League B. Poland have struggled to find consistency in this season’s Nations League campaign, picking up just one win, one draw and three losses so far. Despite holding group leaders Portugal to a 0-0 draw last month, the Bialo-czerwoni were ultimately overpowered 5-1 in the reverse fixture on Friday, with Cristiano Ronaldo netting a brace. Veteran striker Krzysztof Piatek has been the team’s main goal threat, but the absence of talisman Robert Lewandowski has been keenly felt. Scotland, on the other hand, come into this clash buoyed by a crucial 1-0 victory over Croatia in their previous outing. Returning hero John McGinn scored the winner to keep Steve Clarke’s side’s slim quarter-final hopes alive. The Scots have been inconsistent, with two losses, a draw and a win in their last four Nations League matches. Poland have managed just one win in their last six competitive fixtures, a 3-2 triumph over Croatia in September. Their recent form has been particularly poor, with three losses in their last four matches across all competitions. Scotland ended a 10-game winless run in all competitions with their victory over Croatia. Prior to that, they had suffered three consecutive defeats in the Nations League, including a 2-1 loss to the Poles in the reverse fixture. In the previous meeting between these sides in September, Poland emerged 3-2 victors thanks to goals from Robert Lewandowski and Sebastian Szymanski. Overall, the head-to-head record is even, with the teams mostly ending their matches with stalemates. Although historically Scotland has beaten Poland only once while the later have two wins. At least two goals have been scored in their matches played. Poland will be without Arkadiusz Milik and their captain and all-time top scorer Robert Lewandowski, who is sidelined with a back injury. Scotland are expected to field a similar lineup to the one that defeated Croatia, with teenage winger Ben Doak likely to feature prominently. Veteran goalkeeper Craig Gordon and midfielder John McGinn, who scored the winner last time out, should retain their places. This match promises to be a closely contested affair, with both teams desperate to avoid relegation from League A. Poland’s defensive vulnerabilities could be exposed by Scotland’s attacking threat, but the hosts’ home advantage and the potential absence of Lewandowski may prove decisive. – Poland to win: The home side are the favorites to secure the three points and avoid relegation.
– Over 2.5 goals: With both teams needing to go all-out for the win, this fixture could see a high-scoring encounter.
– Krzysztof Piatek to score anytime: The Polish striker has been his team’s main goal threat and will be looking to add to his tally.",2024-11-17,unknown,48.155819207900834,credible,1,1,0.36,0.64

Match [&#8230;]","Concluding League A Group 1 of the 2024-25 UEFA Nations League, Croatia and Portugal lock horns in a top-of-the-table showdown at the Stadion Poljud in Split on Monday. The Selecao have already secured their spot in the quarter-finals as group winners, but Croatia need a point to guarantee their place in the knockout stages. Portugal have been in imperious form in the Nations League, sweeping aside the competition in customary fashion. Talisman Cristiano Ronaldo was responsible for two goals in their 5-1 thrashing of Poland on Friday, including an acrobatic overhead kick to bring up his 132nd international win – the most by any male player. Roberto Martinez’s side have lost just one of their previous 10 Nations League matches away from home, with that solitary defeat coming against Switzerland in June 2022. Croatia, on the other hand, have had a mixed bag of results since their 2-1 friendly victory over Portugal in the summer. After taking seven points from nine on offer between September 8 and October 15, the Chequered Ones squandered an opportunity to rubber-stamp a second-placed finish in the group, suffering a 1-0 loss to Scotland at Hampden Park. Portugal’s recent form has been nothing short of exemplary, winning four and drawing one of their last five competitive and non-competitive fixtures. In contrast, Croatia have won two, drawn one and lost two of their previous five matches across all competitions. Portugal hold a dominant 7-2 advantage over Croatia in their previous nine encounters, with the Selecao avenging their summer friendly defeat by the same scoreline in their first Nations League showdown of the year back in September. With top spot in the group already secured, Martinez has allowed some of his big-hitters, including Ronaldo, Bernardo Silva, and the suspended Bruno Fernandes, to head back to their clubs early. This could open the door for Fabio Silva and in-demand Sporting Lisbon full-back Geovany Quenda to feature. Livakovic; Pongracic, Caleta-Car, Sutalo, Gvardiol; Modric, Kovacic; L. Sucic, Pasalic, Perisic; Kramaric R. Silva; Cancelo, Djalo, Araujo, Tavares; Vitinha, Neves; Conceicao, Felix, Trincao; F. Silva With Martinez resting some of his key players, Croatia should be able to capitalize and secure the point they need to join Portugal in the Nations League quarter-finals. However, the Selecao’s wealth of talent means they are still likely to pose a significant threat, and a draw seems the most plausible outcome. – Both teams to score (Yes)

Denmark, on the other hand, suffered a setback in their last outing, losing 2-1 at home to Spain. However, they remain second in Group 4 and are 90 minutes away from reaching the Nations League’s new knockout stage. Former Brentford assistant Brian Riemer will take charge of his first away fixture as Denmark’s national team manager. Serbia’s recent form has been inconsistent, with two draws, two losses, and one win in their last five competitive matches. They’ll be hoping to build on their late equalizer against Switzerland and secure a vital victory on home soil. Denmark have been slightly more consistent, winning two, drawing one, and losing two of their last five games in all competitions. Their last defeat to Spain was their first loss in four matches. The Danes have a slight edge in the recent meetings between these two sides. They’ve won three of the last four games against Serbia, including a 2-0 victory in September, without conceding a goal. Serbia will be without the services of Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and his brother, goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic, while Torino’s Ivan Ilic is sidelined due to a knee injury. Denmark’s new coach, Brian Riemer, faces a tough decision upfront, with Rasmus Hojlund, Kasper Dolberg, and Yussuf Poulsen all vying for a starting berth. Serbia: 3-4-1-2 Petrovic; Stojic, Milenkovic, Pavlovic; Nedeljkovic, Maksimovic, Gudelj, Terzic; Samardzic; Vlahovic, Mitrovic Denmark: 4-2-3-1 Schmeichel; Bah, Andersen, Vestergaard, Kristiansen; Hjulmand, Hojbjerg; Skov Olsen, Eriksen, Dorgu; Hojlund With both teams desperate for a win, this is set to be a closely contested affair. While Serbia will have the home advantage, Denmark’s defensive solidity and counter-attacking threat could prove the difference. A 1-1 draw seems the most likely outcome, which would secure Denmark’s spot in the quarter-finals.",2024-11-17,unknown,48.155819207900834,credible,1,1,0.38,0.62

The game was suspended for 12 minutes when Hungary’s Adam Szalai suddenly fell ill on the sidelines, with medical staff rushing to attend to him. While the players waited anxiously, Netherlands striker Wout Weghorst stepped up and converted a penalty to give his team the lead once play resumed. However, Weghorst’s exuberant celebration was widely criticized by Dutch pundits, who felt the timing was insensitive given the troubling scenes that had just unfolded. When you score and celebrate like Wout Weghorst did, it really makes my stomach turn,” said former Tottenham star Rafael van der Vaart. “You also see the other players following him and thinking: ‘Oh, let’s just follow him.’ This could have been [more restrained].” Netherlands manager Ronald Koeman defended his player, saying Weghorst “must be happy that he scored the penalty.” But the striker later acknowledged the negative reaction, stating: “In hindsight, I understand the negative reactions, but it was just a relief on my part.” The match ultimately finished 4-0 to the Netherlands, but the unsavory incident cast a pall over the proceedings and sparked a wider debate about the appropriate behavior expected from players in such emotionally-charged situations.",2024-11-17,unknown,29.478,credible,1,1,0.29,0.71

Luis de la Fuente&#8217;s [&#8230;]","Spain, the reigning Nations League champions, will welcome Switzerland to Estadio Heliodoro Rodriguez Lopez on Monday evening as they round off their Group 4 campaign in League A. The Roja have already secured their place in the quarter-finals, sitting top of the group with 13 points from five matches. Luis de la Fuente’s side have been in impressive form, winning each of their last four games after drawing their opener against Serbia. Spain have scored 10 goals and conceded just twice in the competition so far, with Mikel Oyarzabal and Ayoze Perez on the scoresheet in their 2-1 victory over Denmark on Friday. The European champions will be looking to finish their group stage on a high, with a number of fringe players expected to be given opportunities. In contrast, Switzerland’s Nations League campaign has been a disappointment. Murat Yakin’s team have picked up just two points from their five matches, confirming their relegation to League B. The Swiss drew 1-1 with Serbia last time out, with Zeki Amdouni scoring their goal. Switzerland have struggled for form, losing their first three matches against Denmark, Spain and Serbia before drawing at home against Denmark last month. Their only victory in all competitions since the European Championships came in a 2-0 win over Italy in the last 16. The two sides last met in September, with Spain running out 4-1 winners in the reverse fixture. Overall, Switzerland have only beaten Spain on two occasions, including a famous 1-0 victory at the 2010 World Cup. Spain have released Martin Zubimendi, Alex Baena and Mikel Oyarzabal from their squad, with the latter missing out through injury. However, Nico Williams, Dani Olmo and Alvaro Morata are all expected to feature. For Switzerland, Dereck Kutesa, Joel Monteiro and Andi Zeqiri could come into the starting lineup, with Breel Embolo potentially dropping to the bench. Despite Spain making changes, they should still have too much quality for an out-of-form Switzerland side. De la Fuente’s side are the reigning champions and have not lost a competitive match since March 2023. The Roja are expected to secure a comfortable 2-0 victory. With Spain already assured of their place in the quarter-finals and Switzerland relegated, the home side will be keen to end their group campaign on a positive note. The Roja’s superior quality should shine through, even with a rotated lineup.",2024-11-17,unknown,48.155819207900834,credible,1,1,0.41,0.59

The Atlas Lions have been in dominant form in Group B, winning all five of their matches so far and establishing an eight-point lead at the top of the table. Walid Regragui’s side kicked off their qualifying journey with a 4-1 thrashing of Gabon before recording a pair of comfortable victories over Lesotho and the Central African Republic. Morocco’s only blemish so far came in their most recent outing, a 5-1 triumph over Gabon, where they fell behind to an early Denis Bouanga strike before storming back. Brahim Diaz was the star of the show, scoring twice and providing an assist as the home side extended their unbeaten run. Lesotho, on the other hand, have endured a difficult start to their AFCON qualifying campaign. Leslie Notsi’s men suffered back-to-back defeats against the Central African Republic and Morocco to begin their journey, before claiming a hard-fought point against Gabon. However, Likuena finally got their first win on the board in their most recent match, a 1-0 victory over the Central African Republic. Neo Mokhachane scored the decisive goal to keep alive Lesotho’s slim hopes of securing a second-place finish in the group. The two sides met for the first time in September, with Morocco claiming a narrow 1-0 triumph. The Atlas Lions will be confident of completing the double over their opponents, having won four of the previous five meetings between the nations. Jamal Harkass scored his first international goal in Morocco’s win over Gabon, and the defender could be rewarded with a place in the starting XI. Ismael Saibari, who also impressed off the bench last time out, may also earn a starting berth. Lesotho will be boosted by the return of Neo Mokhachane, who netted the winner against the Central African Republic. Goalkeeper Sekhoane Moerane will be crucial to the visitors’ chances of securing a positive result. Morocco have been dominant in their qualifying campaign so far and should have too much quality for Lesotho.

A [&#8230;]","As the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign draws to a close, Ghana will host Niger on Monday in a dead-rubber fixture, with the Black Stars already eliminated from contention. Otto Addo’s side have endured a dismal qualifying run, picking up just four points from their five matches in Group F. A 1-1 draw against Angola in their last outing condemned Ghana to their first failure to reach the AFCON in over two decades. The home side’s attacking woes have been a key factor in their downfall, with the two-time African champions managing just two goals so far. Leicester City’s Jordan Ayew scored a free-kick against Angola, but they were pegged back late on to share the spoils. Ghana’s last five AFCON qualifying results:
L 1-0 vs Angola
D 1-1 vs Angola
D 0-0 vs Sudan
L 2-0 vs Sudan
D 0-0 vs Niger With no chance of making it to the finals in Morocco, Monday’s clash at the Accra Sports Stadium will be a mere formality for the Black Stars. However, they will be keen to avoid the embarrassment of failing to win any of their six group stage matches. Meanwhile, Niger still harbor slim hopes of snatching a place in the AFCON, sitting third in the group, three points behind Sudan. The Mena picked up a crucial 4-0 win over Sudan in their last outing, with Youssouf Oumarou, Ousseni Badamassi and a brace from Daniel Sosah inspiring the victory. Niger’s last five AFCON qualifying results:
L 2-0 vs Angola
D 0-0 vs Ghana
L 1-0 vs Angola
L 2-1 vs Sudan
W 4-0 vs Sudan Despite their slim hopes, Niger face a daunting task against a Ghana side that has dominated the fixture in recent years. The Black Stars are unbeaten in 13 of the last 15 meetings between the two nations, winning 11 and drawing two since 1969. Ghana will be without the injured trio of Abdul Fatawu Issahaku, Jordan Ayew and Gideon Mensah for the clash. Niger, on the other hand, are expected to field a similar lineup to the one that thrashed Sudan, with Sosah leading the line. Ghana: 4-3-3 Nurudeen; Mensah, Simpson, Seidu, Schindler; Sulemana, Owusu, Baidoo; Annan, Konigsdorffer, Naumah Niger: 4-3-3 Djibo; Garba, Katkore, Sako, Alhassane; Oumarou, Badamassi, Mohamed; Hainikoye, Sosah, Amoustapha Despite their dismal qualifying campaign, Ghana should have enough quality to see off Niger at home.

San Jose State's volleyball team hopped into first place in the Mountain West Saturday after transgender player Blaire Fleming dominated with 24 kills, including a dramatic game-winning play against Colorado State. Fleming's dominant performance came just days after players on the team and around the conference filed a lawsuit that alleges danger and an unfair advantage the biological male poses over other women's volleyball players. But that didn't stop the entire team from rushing to Fleming on the court to celebrate the player's winning serve.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM In the deciding fifth set, Fleming set up San Jose State for the win with a late spike. Then, Fleming made the final serve, which was mishandled by Colorado State's Kate Yoshimoto, clinching a victory. And then, in a moment of unbridled competitive adrenaline, all of Fleming's teammates, including players Brooke Slusser, Chandler Manusky and others listed on the lawsuit, quickly jumped into the group celebration.  Slusser and Manusky have alleged Fleming conspired with Colorado State's Malaya Jones to have Slusser spiked in the face in the first meeting between the two teams Oct. 3, according to the lawsuit.  ""Manusky said that at Jones’ residence Fleming had shared with Jones the scouting for the CSU-FC game and they had discussed Fleming ‘throw[ing] the game’ and how they would set up Jones to ‘blow up’ Slusser and ‘blast’ her in the face during the game,"" the court documents state.  ""Manusky also said that Fleming stated, ‘I’m going to leave center court open,’ which would allow Malaya Jones to have a wide open shot to try to ‘blow up Slusser,’ i.e., to try to hit Brooke Slusser in the face with the ball."" Slusser appeared on Fox News Channel's ""The Inghram Angle"" Friday night to further speak out against Fleming's presence on the team and the university and Mountain West for enabling it.  Blaire Fleming, a redshirt senior at San Jose State University, plays as an outside and right-side hitter on the women’s volleyball team. (San Jose State University) ""After finding out that they had planned to give each other our scouting reports and leave the block down so the ball could easily be swung at me during the game, it was astonishing for me to find that information out. It was incredibly insane,"" Slusser said.  One day later, Slusser and Fleming, two seniors, appeared on the court for the team's senior day and played like normal volleyball teammates. Fleming was even cheered loudly by the San Jose State crowd during the senior day ceremony.  Fans in the audience held posters that said ""dare to struggle, dare to win,"" and ""block out the haters.""  Despite suing over alleged danger and unfair advantages over Fleming's presence on the team, Slusser and Manusky contributed to a game plan that was based on setting up Fleming to deliver powerful spikes.  INSIDE SAN JOSE STATE'S POLICE BATTLE TO PROTECT WOMEN'S ATHLETES THREATENED BY A TRANSGENDER CULTURE WAR Fleming led the game with 24 kills, 56 total attacks and 10 errors. Fleming fell one kill shy of tying a career high.  Slusser previously joined a lawsuit earlier this year, headed by former college swimmer Riley Gaines, against the NCAA over the association's policies on gender identity that allowed Fleming to join the team without the other players knowing the athlete's natural birth sex. ""Brooke estimates that Fleming’s spikes were traveling upward of 80 mph, which was faster than she had ever seen a woman hit a volleyball,"" Slusser’s complaint states. ""The girls were doing everything they could to dodge Fleming’s spikes but still could not fully protect themselves."" Fleming previously set a single-game record at John Champe High School with 30 kills in a match and a single-season record of 266 kills for the school's girls volleyball team. Footage from the athlete's Hudl page of the school-record 30-kill match in September 2019 shows how hard and fast Fleming's spikes came down at the high school level against female opponents. President Trump even went out of his way to comment about footage of one of Fleming's plays in which the player spiked a ball at San Diego State player Keira Herron in a match earlier this season. ""I saw the slam. It was a slam. I never saw a ball hit so hard,"" Trump said during a Fox News town hall. ""But other people, even in volleyball, they’ve been permanently — I mean, they've been really hurt badly. Women playing men."" The most recent lawsuit, which is filed against San Jose State and the Mountain West Conference, alleges other players were passed over for scholarships in favor of Fleming. Fleming received a full scholarship, while a biological female, Alyssa Sugai, did not receive a scholarship and alleges she was told by coaches she was not ""phyiscal"" enough as a player compared to Fleming. Sugai is now part of the lawsuit and seeking monetary damages after the decision to grant Fleming a scholarship instead caused Sugai's volleyball career to end, resulting in severe depression.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Former San Jose State player Elle Patterson is also part of the lawsuit and alleges she did not receive a scholarship. Patterson also played behind Fleming and alleges the university did not fulfill previous verbal offers of a scholarship to her for the 2023 and 2024 seasons. Patterson says she even paid full tuition to play in 2023 after being told she would get a scholarship for 2024. However, the program did not make good on that offer either, she alleges.  San Jose State previously addressed the allegations in a statement to Fox News Digital.  ""The safety and well-being of our student athletes and employees is our highest priority. The university has taken and will continue to take multiple steps to provide security, support and resources to all members of the team as the program navigates this challenging time,"" the statement said. ""San Jose State takes all reports and complaints seriously, but we are unable to provide any information regarding confidential complaints and reports out of respect for the parties involved and due to federal and state privacy laws.  ""The university also has concerns about a number of inaccuracies in the press but is not able to comment further on those in light of privacy rights of all involved. We will continue to honor the privacy of our employees and students. We require and expect that all of our employees abide by our standards, policies and applicable laws regarding student and employee privacy."" The team has just one match left in the regular season with a meeting against Fresno State scheduled for Tuesday. Questions still remain about the team's postseason prospects.  San Jose State has had seven matches on its schedule forfeited amid the controversy involving Fleming. Southern Utah, Boise State, Utah State, Wyoming and Nevada all declined to face the Spartans. Boise State and Wyoming forfeited two matches each, taking multiple losses to avoid competition against Fleming.  And now, standing alone in first place in the conference, the Spartans are set to have a top seed in the Mountain West tournament, starting Nov. 27. Slusser told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview she and her teammates are in limbo about what a potential postseason run might look like as they navigate a demoralized locker room. ""We're just mostly wondering, are teams even gonna play us, period, if we go there? Because of just everything that's happened this season,"" Slusser said. ""It seems like every few days it looks like It'll be a fine day and everything's normal, and then something else happens. So, I truly do think everyone's just kind of taking things day by day and taking the punches as they come.""

""I’ve kicked a ball before. I played soccer my whole life.

Former host of ""The View"" Rosie Perez was part of Netflix's broadcast booth for its Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight on Friday.  Perez is an actress who served as the grand marshal for the International Boxing Hall of Fame parade in 2013. Among some, she holds the nickname ""the First Lady of Boxing.""  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM ""I learned how to box because I used to get beat up a lot. And I was scrappy. I would always fight back all the time, even though I would lose,"" she told The Guardian in 2022. Perez was also a temporary host on ABC's ""The View"" earlier this year and contributed thoughts about the recent election multiple times, and often voiced opposition to President-elect Donald Trump.  During an episode on October 14, Perez criticized Trump's response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017.  ""He blocked federal funding to go down there, he threw paper towels at us!"" Perez said.  She also pointed to Latino unemployment levels under Trump's administration and to reports that Trump had sent COVID-19 tests to Russia.  ""Please go to the polls and vote for Kamala Harris,"" Perez said while claiming to address Latino voters. After Trump's Oct. 27 rally at Madison Square Garden, Perez was one of the many liberal voices to criticize a comedy routine by Tony Hinchcliffe, who jokingly referred to Puerto Rico as a ""floating island of garbage."" ""I was angry, I was hurt"" Perez said in response during an interview on MSNBC on Oct. 31. ""But I have to tell you, they picked on the wrong people.""  ""We don't take it, we don't take it sitting down . . . I think a lot of people are going to go to the polls.""  Trump went on to win the Electoral College and popular vote, while earning the largest percentage of Latino voters for a Republican candidate in the party's modern era.  Perez made a post on Instagram on Nov. 6 acknowledging Trump's electoral win, with an image of a quote by famed poet Toni Morrison. Perez acknowledged that many were ""disappointed and saddened"" about the results but said Americans ""must respect it if we truly believe in democracy.""  But since then, the only activity on any of Perez's social media channels has been all about boxing. Now she is in the booth to put her political differences with Paul and Tyson aside to broadcast one of the biggest events in sports history.  MEGAN RAPINOE TAKES SWIPE AT ‘VIOLENT REALITY’ OF ANOTHER TRUMP PRESIDENCY Rosie Perez attends the world premiere of Apple's ""Before"" series at the Museum of Modern Art on October 16, 2024, in New York City.  (Michael Loccisano/WireImage) Paul and Tyson are vocal Trump supporters, with Tyson's connection dating back to his personal friendship with Trump during the prime of the boxer's career. Tyson endorsed Trump during his first presidential run in 2016, confirming it in an interview with HuffPost Life in October of that year.  ""He should be president of the United States. That's what he should be... Why are people mad at the people? Because this is who the people want to be president,"" Tyson said. ""Let's try something new. Let's run America like a business, where no colors matter. Whoever can do the job, gets the job."" Paul endorsed Trump in a video where he made a passionate plea to his followers to vote for the former president on Oct. 31.  ""Do the right thing, vote for Donald Trump. Not because I said so, not because Beyoncé said so, but because it’s what’s right. . . . Please, go, for the love of God, go exercise your right to vote on my behalf and vote for Donald Trump in this election. America depends on it,"" Paul said.  ""Democrats have been in power for 12 of the last 16 years. So, if we aren’t happy with the current political state, economic state, environmental state, then who is to blame?""  But that hasn't prompted Perez from saying anything but positive and exciting things about the boxers and their hyped fight.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Perez even sat down to do an interview with Tyson for Interview Magazine, where Tyson revealed that he avoided AIDS despite having sex with a woman who also had the disease.  Perez thanked Tyson for sitting down with her to tell her these details in an X post on Tuesday.  ""TY for the opportunity @InterviewMag and special thanks to @MikeTyson I had a blast chopping it up with you.

But by the fourth round, as Tyson began to look like a 58-year-old who hadn’t had a professional fight in 19 years, the crowd began to die out. Several moments later, boo-birds were loud, and the crowd then grew restless.  The reaction on social media was similar, with many losing interest rather quickly in the biggest boxing spectacle in modern history. Perhaps tons of connection issues on Netflix, where the fight was shown live, and minutes of buffering added to the let-down as well.

Neither said they were surprised it went the distance, and Tyson said he was happy with what he did in the ring - he said he wasn’t in the ring to please the world, just to show himself what he can do.  The former heavyweight champ added that Paul ""absolutely"" deserves to be respected as a boxer.

The two sides met last Thursday in Kingston, where an early goal from Ricardo Pepi gave the Americans a 1-0 victory and the advantage heading into the return fixture. Mauricio Pochettino’s side are aiming to retain the Nations League title they won in 2023, while Jamaica are looking to reach the semi-finals for the first time. The USA have been dominant at home in this competition, winning all three of their knockout round matches at CityPark while conceding just once. They will be confident of securing their place in the final four, having won 8 of their 12 all-time matches in St. Louis. Jamaica, meanwhile, will be hoping to overturn the first-leg deficit and spring an upset. Steve McClaren’s men have proven to be a tough opponent for the Americans in recent meetings, with three of their last four encounters ending in 1-1 draws. The Reggae Boyz were the last Caribbean nation to defeat the USA on home soil, winning 1-0 at Audi Field in 2019. However, they will have to do without the injured Bobby Decordova-Reid and the suspended Mason Holgate for the trip to Missouri. Pochettino is also dealing with some injury concerns of his own, with Johnny Cardoso, Aidan Morris and several key attackers unavailable. But the Americans can still call upon the experienced duo of Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah, who will be looking to guide their side to victory. Jamaica were in a similar position 12 months ago, losing the first leg of their quarter-final against Canada before bouncing back to win the return match 3-2 and advance. They will be hoping for a repeat of that resilience on Tuesday. The visitors have scored in three of their last four meetings with the USA, but have failed to score against Pochettino’s men last time. A tight, cagey affair seems the most likely outcome, with the home side’s greater depth and tournament pedigree potentially proving the difference. A place in the semi-finals of the CONCACAF Nations League is at stake, and both teams will be desperate to book their spot in the final four. The USA will be favourites to get the job done, but Jamaica have shown they can more than match their opponents on their day.",2024-11-16,unknown,29.478,credible,1,1,0.34,0.66

Stale Solbakken’s side are currently level on points with group leaders Austria in League B Group 3, but trail the Austrians on head-to-head record after suffering a 5-1 defeat in Vienna last month. However, Norway can clinch first place if they beat Kazakhstan and Austria fail to win against Slovenia. Norway booked their spot in the top two with a 4-1 victory away to Slovenia on Thursday. Erling Haaland scored his 35th international goal in just his 38th cap, while Antonio Nusa netted a brace. The result means Norway are guaranteed to finish above Matjaz Kek’s Slovenia regardless of the outcome on the final matchday. A top-two finish is assured, but Solbakken will be targeting top spot and automatic promotion to League A. Kazakhstan, who were promoted from League C last season, have endured a miserable Nations League campaign so far, losing four of their five matches and failing to score a single goal. They were thrashed 2-0 at home by Austria in their last outing. Stanislav Cherchesov’s side have lost 11 of their last 14 away games and will be heavy underdogs against a Norway team boasting the attacking talents of Haaland and Nusa. The Kazakhs will be without the suspended Aleksandr Marochkin for the trip to Oslo. Norway captain Martin Odegaard has been left out of the squad as he continues his recovery from a recent injury, but Solbakken has several other experienced options in midfield and attack. Egil Selvik is expected to deputize in goal with Orjan Nyland among the absentees. Despite their poor form, Kazakhstan will be hoping to finish their Nations League campaign on a high note. Midfielder Bakhtiyor Zaynutdinov will be keen to impress, having fallen out of favor at his club side Besiktas. A victory for Norway would cap an impressive Nations League campaign that has seen them lose just one of their six matches so far. Solbakken’s men are aiming to build on their recent progress and mount a serious challenge for a place at the 2026 World Cup. The neutral supporters will be hoping for a more entertaining affair than the 0-0 draw between the two sides in the reverse fixture in Almaty, where Norway managed just one shot on target and Kazakhstan’s expected goals (xG) was below 0.1.",2024-11-16,unknown,29.478,credible,1,1,0.39,0.61

A victory over Slovenia would secure Austria’s promotion back to League A. Slovenia, meanwhile, are third in the group on 7 points after a 4-1 home defeat to Norway in their last outing. Matjaz Kek’s team must win to have any chance of finishing in the top two and earning a playoff spot for promotion. The reverse fixture between the two sides earlier in the campaign ended 1-1 in Ljubljana. Austria have won the three previous meetings, including 1-0 home and away victories in Euro 2020 qualifying. Austria come into the match in strong form, winning their last three Nations League games and scoring 11 goals in the process. They cruised to a 2-0 victory over Kazakhstan in their most recent fixture. Slovenia, on the other hand, have won just one of their last eight competitive matches, that victory coming against Kazakhstan in Euro 2024 qualifying.

Both sides have struggled mightily in the current campaign, with Israel sitting at the foot of the group without a win. Belgium, despite their pedigree, have also under-performed, winning just one of their six matches. The Belgians’ slim hopes of reaching the Nations League quarter-finals were extinguished by a 1-0 loss to group leaders Italy on Thursday. Sandro Tonali’s first-half goal proved the difference, as Belgium’s star-studded attack, including Romelu Lukaku, failed to find an equalizer. Israel, ranked 81st in the world, have been outmatched at the top level, though they did manage a creditable 0-0 draw against France in their last outing. Goalkeeper Daniel Peretz was the hero, keeping a clean sheet in the near-empty Stade de France. Sunday’s match at Budapest’s Bozsik Stadium represents a must-win for both sides. Israel can only avoid automatic relegation to League B if they beat Belgium by three goals or more, while the Red Devils need a victory to have any chance of making the relegation playoff in March.

Interim manager Lee Carsley’s side currently top League B Group 2 and need only a point against Ireland to secure automatic promotion back to League A. England bounced back from an October defeat to Greece with a comprehensive 3-0 win over the Greeks in their last outing, putting them in pole position to clinch first place. The visitors, meanwhile, have already been condemned to a playoff to preserve their second-tier status after finishing third in the group. Ireland’s 1-0 win over Finland last time out ensured the Scandinavians’ relegation, but Heimir Hallgrimsson’s men have failed to beat any opponent other than Finland in this year’s competition. England have won four of their 10 previous home games in the Nations League, while Ireland are seeking their first victory against the Three Lions since Euro 1988. Carsley is expected to make changes for his final game in charge, with the likes of Ollie Watkins, Jude Bellingham and Morgan Rogers pushing for starts. A win for England would cap a successful interim spell for Carsley before he steps down, with Thomas Tuchel set to take over the national team.

Italy currently top Group 2 in League A after winning four of their five matches so far. Luciano Spalletti’s side secured their place in the knockout rounds with a narrow 1-0 victory over Belgium in their last outing, courtesy of an early strike from Sandro Tonali. In contrast, France have had a more inconsistent campaign. Didier Deschamps’ men were held to a 0-0 draw at home against Israel in their previous Nations League fixture, leaving them needing to win by two goals against Italy to finish top of the group. The two European powerhouses have a storied history, with France prevailing in the Euro 2000 final before Italy gained revenge by winning the 2006 World Cup on penalties. This weekend’s clash will write the latest chapter in the rivalry. Italy are unbeaten in their last six matches in all competitions, while France have won three and drawn two of their previous five games. With both teams already assured of progression, the focus will be on finishing top of the group ahead of the quarter-finals scheduled for March 2025. Spalletti may rotate his squad, with Moise Kean pushing for a start after his recent hat-trick for Fiorentina.

The former Manchester United star’s tumultuous second stint in Turin has come to an abrupt end. Pogba, 31, rejoined Juventus in 2022 on a free transfer after leaving United. However, his time back in Serie A was plagued by injury and controversy. In March 2023, the French international was hit with a four-year doping ban after elevated testosterone levels were detected in his system. Though the ban was later reduced to 18 months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the damage was done. Juventus manager Thiago Motta recently admitted that the club now views Pogba as “past the peak of his career.” In a statement, Juventus said: “Juventus Football Club and Paul Pogba announce that they have reached a mutual agreement for the termination of their contract as of 30 November, 2024. The club wishes Paul the very best for his professional future.” Pogba, for his part, expressed gratitude for his time with the club. “My time at Juventus has come to an end. It has been a privilege to pull on the shirt of the bianconeri and to share so many special moments,” he said. The 2018 World Cup winner is now a free agent, with potential suitors in France, the Premier League, Saudi Arabia, and MLS, including David Beckham’s Inter Miami.

The 39-year-old Portuguese manager joins the Red Devils after a successful spell at Sporting Lisbon, where he guided the club to a league title last season. In his first comments since taking over at Old Trafford, Amorim expressed a strong “connection” with the historic Premier League club, calling them “the engine of the Premier League.” He emphasized the “great responsibility” he feels in trying to return United to the top of the English game. “When Manchester United talked to me, they told me about their plans. It’s a real honour because I was the first choice to start that path,” Amorim told MUTV. “So it’s a great responsibility. But you feel honoured and excited to be part of this.” United currently sit 13th in the Premier League table, but are only four points off the top four. Amorim is expected to implement his favoured 3-4-3 formation, which brought him significant success at Sporting. “We know that if the team plays well and wins games, everything looks so much better and the people really start to believe in the new stadium and new ideas,” Amorim said. “So, we know that we are the engine of the football. Manchester United is the engine of the Premier League in my opinion.” The new manager’s visa is expected to arrive in time for him to take training on Monday and prepare the team for their next Premier League match against Ipswich Town on November 24.",2024-11-16,unknown,29.478,credible,1,1,0.38,0.62

1704,Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Democrats planning to replace Seth Moulton after speaking out against trans athletes,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/democrats-planning-replace-seth-moulton-after-speaking-out-against-trans-athletes,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 16:48:08 -0500",Democrats in Massachusetts are preparing to support a candidate to oppose Seth Moulton after he made comments about trans inclusion in women&apos;s sports.,"Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., ripped the Democratic Party as ""very arrogant"" following its stunning electoral defeat at the hands of President-elect Donald Trump last week. Democrats in Massachusetts are plotting a revolt against House Rep. Seth Moulton after he made multiple statements condemning his party for supporting trans inclusion in women's sports, according to the Boston Globe.  Salem Democratic City Committee chair Liz Bradt told the Globe that she had heard from ""several"" people in the area who were considering running against him in Massachusetts’ Sixth District. ""We will find someone to run against him and win,"" Bradt said.  Moulton is up for re-election in 2026. But he has been the subject of intense criticism by members in his own state and party since last week, when he spoke out against his party's stance on trans athletes in women's and girls' sports in a New York Times article. Moulton has doubled down on his comments in several interviews since then, inciting more and more backlash from his party members.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) questions Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley during a House Armed Services Committee hearing July 9, 2020, on ""Department of Defense Authorities and Roles Related to Civilian Law Enforcement,"" in Washington, D.C.  (Greg Nash/Pool/AFP via Getty Images) Salem city councilor Kyle Davis, who is planning a pro-trans rally outside of Moulton's office this Sunday, told Fox News Digital that he will actively contribute to another candidate who challenges Moulton, and is even calling for the congressman to resign ahead of 2026.  ""I certainly am calling on Seth Moulton to resign and will be supporting any Democrat and LGBT ally that runs against him,"" Davis said.  Moulton's original comments about the subject were rooted in his stance as a father to two daughters. In television interviews with CNN and MSNBC, the Democrat has stood firm and has not made any apologies.  But Moulton also told Fox News Digital's Liz Elkind in an exclusive interview that there are others in the Democrat party who agree with him.   ""While a few, a handful, maybe just a couple members of Congress have spoken out against the comments, I've got an awful lot more who will go up to me privately and say thank you,"" Moulton said.  Moulton also said he welcomes any challengers from within his own party to run against him in 2026.  ""It’s a democracy. If you want to run against me, go for it,"" Moulton said, but added that it was ""not going to be very helpful for winning elections."" ""What we need to do is defeat Republicans, not fellow Democrats."" Democrats who have previously voted for laws that would enable transgender inclusion in women's sports have publicly denounced their support for the concept in the weeks leading up to Election Day. They include Texas Reps. Colin Allred and Vicente Gonzalez and Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola.  TRANS VOLLEYBALL PLAYER ACCUSED OF PLAN TO HARM TEAMMATE AFTER TAKING SCHOLARSHIPS FROM FEMALE PLAYERS Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., also spoke out against trans inclusion in the same New York Times article as Moulton.  The Biden-Harris administration passed a sweeping reform to Title IX in April that aimed to provide more protection for gender identity in schools and universities. It clarified that Title IX’s ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions."" And while the administration insisted the regulation does not address athletic eligibility, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that it would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.  Democrats have introduced and co-sponsored the Equality Act in congress, which was proposed in 2019 and has had revisions that ""would force public schools to allow biologically male athletes who identify as transgender on girls' sports teams."" In March 2023, Democrats advocated for a transgender bill of rights, proposing a resolution ""recognizing that it is the duty of the Federal Government to develop and implement a Transgender Bill of Rights.""  Multiple states have filed lawsuits and enacted their own laws to address this issue, and then the U.S. Supreme Court then voted 5-4 in August to reject an emergency request by the Biden administration to enforce its sweeping Title IX changes in the states trying to prevent it.  But that hasn't prevented such reforms from happening altogether, thanks to the work of Democrat judges. At the high school level, multiple Obama-era federal judges have passed rulings that allow transgender inclusion in girls sports. Judges Landya McCafferty in New Hampshire and M. Hannah Lauck of Virgina each issued rulings this year that enabled biological males to play on high school girls' soccer and tennis teams. Both judges were appointed by Obama in the early 2010s.  President Trump has proposed a full-on ban of all trans inclusion in women's and girls' sports, and it was a campaign issue that he and other Republicans hammered Democrat opponents on in the recent election, en-route to taking back control of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP 2020 US Democratic Presidential hopeful Representative for Massachusetts' 6th congressional district Seth Moulton announces he is ending his campaign for the President of The United States during the Democratic National Committee's summer meeting in San Francisco, California on August 23, 2019.  (Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images) ""People think that this is exactly the kind of debate that we need to have. And it's not just on trans issues, it's on the economy. Why are we out of touch with Americans on the economy when Trump's plan is going to dramatically raise grocery prices? . . . How is it that we're so out of touch on immigration when we're the ones who proposed a bipartisan immigration deal?"" Moulton said to Fox News Digital.  ""It seems like Democrats do have a lot of good solutions for working Americans, and yet we're really out of touch. So we've got to ask ourselves that question. Why have we lost touch with so many people across America?""  Fox News Digital's Liz Elkin contributed to this report.  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.     Jackson Thompson is a sports writer for Fox News Digital.

Tensions boiled over ahead of the long-awaited fight between boxing legend Mike Tyson and Jake Paul on Thursday night when the former heavyweight champion slapped Paul during their final weigh-in.  The shocking altercation triggered a viral reaction on social media, but no one was seemingly more upset by the incident than Paul’s mother, Pam Stepnick.  Jake Paul's mother Pam Stepnick(left) and girlfriend Jutta Leerdam watch the fight against Nate Diaz at American Airlines Center in 2023.  (Kevin Jairaj-USA Today Sports) In a video shared to Paul’s Instagram Stories, Stepnick is seen comforting her son while also making a threat towards Tyson.

It marks Tyson’s first sanctioned fight since 2005, and it will be streamed on Netflix, which has more than 280 million subscribers globally, at no added cost.  Mike Tyson, left, and Jake Paul face off during weigh-ins, held at Toyota Music Factory in Irving, Texas, ahead of their heavyweight bout, on November 15th at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.  (Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile via Getty Images) MIKE TYSON SLAPS JAKE PAUL AT FINAL FACEOFF BEFORE EPIC SHOWDOWN The fight will be eight, two-minute rounds with both boxers wearing heavier gloves. The idea is that the gloves will theoretically lessen the power of the punches. Whom that will benefit more is up for debate.  While some question the legitimacy of the fight – Tyson at 58 and Paul at 27 – the results will be significant. It will count on both their records. Tyson retired with a 50-6 record and 44 knockouts after losing to Kevin McBride 19 years ago, while Paul debuted four years ago and enters the ring with a 10-1 record.  Mike Tyson and Jake Paul are separated as they face off during their ceremonial weigh-in at The Pavilion at Toyota Music Factory on November 14, 2024, in Irving, Texas.

One of the NFL's greatest rivalries in recent years – the Buffalo Bills and Kansas City Chiefs – kicks off its latest chapter in Orchard Park, New York, on Sunday in a highly anticipated matchup.  The Chiefs remain undefeated after blocking a game-winning field goal against the Denver Broncos, while the Bills have ripped off five straight victories to come in at 8-2 on the year.  The team to beat in the NFL is the Chiefs, and though they have been in some close games, they have done whatever it takes to get the job done and make sure their loss column remains clean.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, #17, stiff-arms Indianapolis Colts defensive end Dayo Odeyingbo, #54, during the second half of an NFL football game on Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024 in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings) So, what do the Bills need to do to get a win against their rival? NFL legend Rob Gronkowski knows it all comes to those final minutes in the fourth quarter, better known as ""crunch time."" ""The Bills need to play a complete game. All four quarters, there’s no doubt about that,"" Gronkowski told Fox News Digital at Great Wolf Lodge's grand opening in Naples, Florida, on Thursday. ""And when it comes to crunch time, they cannot make any mistakes because Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs, they don’t make mistakes when it comes to crunch time. They know how to win, no matter what type of game it is.  HOW BROCK PURDY'S CONNECTION WITH GEORGE KITTLE REMINDS TOM BRADY OF ROB GRONKOWSKI ""Patrick Mahomes knows how to adjust to whatever situation is going on out on the field.

They know how to act, and they know how to overcome it. ""So, when it comes to the Bills beating them, we know it’s going to be a close game. It’s going to come down to the wire like every other game with the Chiefs this year. [Buffalo] gotta be able to be perfect in crunch time and not make those mistakes. Catch the ball, they can’t have a drop. They can’t have an interception, they can’t have a fumble when it comes down to the final minutes."" Of course, what ""Gronk"" is saying is easier said than done, but it is the truth: The Chiefs know exactly what to do in crunch time, whether it is a major fourth-down stop against the Atlanta Falcons, driving down the field for a touchdown in overtime against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, or blocking a game-winning field goal last week as time expired.  Say what you want about the Chiefs – they simply know how to win football games.  Rob Gronkowski at Fox Sports media day at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix on Feb. 7, 2023. (Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports) However, Buffalo fans know that this rivalry has not been lopsided. The Bills have won three of their last five meetings, though both of the losses in that span have come in the playoffs. One of them was an all-time NFL classic, as the Chiefs beat the Bills in overtime to advance after Mahomes infamously got downfield in 13 seconds to give Harrison Butker the chance at a field goal to send it to overtime. Since the playoffs are what truly matters to both of these teams, Gronkowski knows what a win for Buffalo, his hometown team, could do for them when it comes time for the matchup everyone wants to see in the playoffs once again.  ""The Bills need to win this game because they need that confidence of going into the playoffs to know they can beat the Chiefs,"" he said. ""They just gotta do it at least once. If they do that this weekend coming up, I feel like it will give the Bills confidence to beat anyone when it comes playoff time."" Gronkowski was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame earlier this week, and all he heard was Bills-Chiefs talk with the area fully prepared to get rowdy on Sunday night.  ""It’s probably going to be the best game of the weekend, which is great for the NFL and great for Buffalo,"" Gronkowski said.  Former NFL player Rob Gronkowski looks on before Super Bowl LVII between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on Feb. 12, 2023.

Here is what to know about the long-awaited bout.,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. IRVING, Texas – Arguably, the biggest boxing event in recent memory is finally here. Jake Paul, who rose to fame through social media, is fighting former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Friday night. Paul says he got the idea after an ayahuasca retreat, and it finally came to fruition when it was announced back in March. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Mike Tyson, left, and Jake Paul face off during their ceremonial weigh-in at The Pavilion at Toyota Music Factory on Nov. 14, 2024 in Irving, Texas. The two are scheduled to meet in a heavyweight bout on Nov. 15 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.  (Christian Petersen/Getty Images) The fight was originally slated for July 20, but when Tyson had an ulcer flare-up in May, the fight was postponed four months. Many may think this is simply a publicity stunt, but the state of Texas is sanctioning this as a professional fight. Meaning, the fight will be on Tyson's record and will be his first official fight since 2005, a sixth-round TKO loss to Kevin McBride (his bout against Roy Jones Jr. in 2020, where Paul was on the undercard against ex-NBA star Nate Robinson, was an exhibition). Meanwhile, this will be Paul's third fight of the calendar year. While it may be sanctioned, there are some tweaks: the fight will be eight, two-minute rounds with 14-ounce gloves.

(Christian Petersen/Getty Images) MIKE TYSON 'FINE' BEING UNDERDOG TO JAKE PAUL; ODDSMAKER SAYS WHY The fight is being branded via Paul's promotion, Most Valuable Promotions, which he and Nakisa Bidarian co-founded in 2021. The promotion helped Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano sell out Madison Square Garden in 2022, and the two will have a rematch as the co-main event on Friday night. Paul-Tyson will be broadcast on Netflix at no additional charge aside from a subscription, meaning the fight can be broadcast on nearly 300 million televisions worldwide. Paul enters the fight at 10-1 in his career, with six of his victories coming via knockout. Tyson is 50-6 with 44 KOs. The two boxers have taken different approaches in the lead up to the fight. Paul is doing what he does best: talk, troll and get people angry. Tyson, meanwhile, has kept his answers short, sweet and very to the point. At least, that was the case until Thursday night. Everyone got a pretty nice preview at the weigh-in, as Tyson smacked Paul with an open hand at the weigh in. Tyson even squared up but was held back by numerous personnel before things escalated.

Coe is a former Olympian for Great Brittain and won two gold medals running in the 1,500m, one in the 1980 Moscow games and one in 1984 in Los Angeles.  The sanctity of women's sports and gender eligibility came under a heated global microscope at this summer's Paris Olympics, when Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan won gold medals in women's boxing. Both athletes had previously been disqualified from international competitions for failing gender eligibility tests. However, the IOC and current President Thomas Bach voiced support for both athletes.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Imane Khelif, right, from Algeria and Luca Anna Hamori from Hungary fight each other. (Sina Schuldt/picture alliance via Getty Images) Coe might sing a very different tune if he is elected president ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.  ""I think the International Olympic Committee needs a very, very clear policy in this space,"" Coe told BBC this week. ""And the protection of the female category, for me, is absolutely non-negotiable.If you are not prepared to do that, and that is where the international federations expect a lead to be taken, then you really will lose female sport and I'm not prepared to see that happen. I'm not sure that policy is clear enough at the moment."" Coe added that the situation involving Khelif and Yu-ting made him ""uncomfortable.""  Khelif and Yu-ting's natural birth sex is disputed.  However, a broader conversation about the inclusion of biological males in girls' and women's sports has erupted across the global sports landscape in recent years, especially in the U.S., where the next Summer Games will take place.  The United Nations released study findings that say nearly 900 biological females have fallen short of the podium because they were beaten out by transgender athletes. The study, titled ""Violence against women and girls in sports,"" said that more than 600 athletes did not medal in more than 400 competitions in 29 different sports, totaling over 890 medals, according to information obtained up to March 30. ""The replacement of the female sports category with a mixed-sex category has resulted in an increasing number of female athletes losing opportunities, including medals, when competing against males,"" the report said. TRANS VOLLEYBALL PLAYER ACCUSED OF PLAN TO HARM TEAMMATE AFTER TAKING SCHOLARSHIPS FROM FEMALE PLAYERS In the U.S., President-elect Donald Trump and even his wife Melania, who has admitted to disagreeing with Republicans on issues of LGBT rights, each announced that they are opposed to allowing biological males to compete in girls' and women's sports. Trump has gone as far as advocating for a full-on ban during a town hall event on Fox News during his campaign.  Since Trump's recent election win, the IOC and Bach have not acknowledged it. When asked why there was no formal acknowledgment of Trump’s win last week, the IOC cited its tradition of neutrality and not taking political sides, according to the AP. Polls show that the majority of Americans are not in favor of trans inclusion in women's sports, which was a key campaign issue for Trump and other Republicans in the recent cycle.  Nearly 70% of Americans do not believe that biological men should be allowed to compete in women's sports, according to a Gallup poll taken last year. In June, a survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago asked respondents to weigh in on whether transgender athletes of both sexes should be permitted to participate in sports leagues that correspond to their preferred gender identity instead of their biological sex. Sixty-five percent answered that it should either never be or rarely be allowed. When those polled were asked specifically about adult transgender female athletes competing on women’s sports teams, 69% opposed it. It is very possible that Trump, now with a Republican majority in both the Senate and House of Representatives, and a conservative majority in the Supreme Court, could make good on his promise to ban trans inclusion in women's sports by the 2028 summer games.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Lord Sebastian Coe speaks during a Memorial Service for Kevan Gosper AO in the Olympic Room at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sept. 17, 2024 in Melbourne, Australia. (Daniel Pockett/Getty Images for the AOC) If Coe wins the IOC presidential election, it could be a point of agreement where the IOC and Trump can find common ground.  Trump has not had a good history of cooperation with Bach.  IOC President Thomas Bach made one visit to the White House in June 2017 that is part of Olympic lore for how badly it went. ""Pray for our world,"" Bach was heard to say on a cellphone call later that day in Washington, D.C.

And when it came to the Lions' rivalry, the Packers were usually the ones taking care of business in those bouts.  But seeing as the Lions are the team to beat at the moment in the division, Matthews can't help but tip his cap to someone like St. Brown, who is already not in the best relationship with Packers fans.  In a rivalry, though, that's just the way it's supposed to be.

""They want to see Amon-Ra have a ‘Green Bay Sucks’ shirt and how Green Bay's going to respond, and the fans take that reaction of, ‘They don’t respect us,' but Detroit playing the ‘Detroit vs. Everybody.’ ""I think it makes great storylines, and it makes it more engaging for us fans now that I've transitioned to being a fan. I love to see it."" Last season, St. Brown even tried to do a ""Lambeau Leap"" touchdown celebration, and one Packers fan decided to pour their beer down his jersey. Since then, St. Brown has been relentless about sticking it to the Packers and its fan base, whenever they're on the schedule.  Detroit Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown catches a pass in front of Green Bay Packers cornerback Keisean Nixon to score a touchdown during the second quarter at Lambeau Field. (Jeff Hanisch - USA TODAY) It will be at Ford Field in Detroit the next time these two square off, a ""Thursday Night Football"" game on Dec. 5.  Would Matthews try something like St. Brown if he was still playing for Green Bay?  ""Hey, I'm not trying to get pelted with beer or anything like that,"" Matthews said, laughing. ""It takes a brave soul to wear something like that to Detroit or Philly or anywhere else for that matter."" But Matthews admits the Lions are certainly the team to beat in the conference, and when that matchup does come around, perhaps his former squad can lean into the rivalry just like St. Brown has to get the juices flowing more than normal. ""Right now, the Lions are rolling. They look great,"" Matthews admitted. ""Obviously, it's still a little early in the season, but they look like the team to beat, in the NFC, that is. I know the Packers dropped one, but they have another one coming up against them. It's going to be a tight race, and it's going to be a fun playoffs to watch.""

Fans will be putting together care packages for military members with Crown Royal’s longtime partner, Packages From Home. ""I think what’s even more important is how Crown Royal is giving back to the military community, specifically with their Purple Bag Project,"" Matthews said. ""Giving away morale-boosting items to our military by giving them the packages from home.  The 18-wheeler Crown Royal Rig is traveling the country to different NFL stadiums to help the military.

Jake Paul and Mike Tyson will duke it out in one of the biggest spectacles in boxing this year. The two will square off in the ring at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Friday night in a special event broadcast only on Netflix. Compared to Tyson, Paul is a relative newcomer. He’s fought an NBA player, a handful of MMA stars and Tommy Fury. He’s only lost once. Tyson hasn’t had a sanctioned fight in nearly two decades.

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez) The debate automatically started about whether it would be a real fight. Paul is 27 years old and Tyson is 58. Both men could get hurt and how much of it is just hype? The bigger question was whether it is good for the sport of boxing and combat sports as a whole. Eric Bischoff, the creative mind behind some of the biggest angles in pro wrestling history, told Fox News Digital in a recent interview he thought it was good for boxing and was intrigued by the matchup.

And I am really fascinated by it. I think it’s great."" ""Obviously, I love the promotion. I love the hype. I’m a huge fan of Mike Tyson – always have been, amazing, amazing fighter. And even as a person, he went through a lot, paid the price. But I think he’s come out a pretty interesting person. I love listening to him speak. So, I can’t wait to watch it.""

The Eagles scored 20 fourth-quarter points to defeat the Commanders and create some distance in their lead in the NFC East. The Commanders were behind 12-10 when they were stopped on second- and third-and-1. Buoyed by an early-season hot streak, coach Dan Quinn called his rookie quarterback’s number on fourth-and-2 from the Eagles 26. Jayden Daniels juggled the snap, scrambled to his right and was hammered out of bounds by linebacker Zack Baun. The Eagles took over on downs. The defining win for the Commanders under Quinn and Daniels has to wait. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Shortly after that misfire, Saquon Barkley rushed for the first of his two fourth-quarter touchdowns to give division-leading Philadelphia a two-score lead, and the Eagles (8-2) sent the Commanders (7-4) to their second straight loss, 26-18 on Thursday night. ""Bold call,"" Quinn said. ""I’d also say we were prepared for that moment. Didn’t love the execution. But we’ve been an excellent fourth-down team. Going into it, we knew we’d have to take our shots against a tough division team on the road. We didn’t like the execution or the result. But we were prepared for that."" Plan B was the field goal. Zane Gonzalez, promoted off the practice squad with Austin Seibert dealing with a hip injury, made a 45-yarder in the third quarter for a 10-3 lead. Quinn decided not to give him another shot from about 44 yards out for a 13-12 lead. ""To be the heavy hitters that we want to be, you’ve got to be able to close,"" Quinn said. ""How do you learn the lesson to close? That’s what we’re going to become. You knew this adversity was coming. It just does."" Daniels finished 22 of 32 for 191 yards and a late touchdown pass. He was intercepted by safety Reed Blankenship late in the fourth, setting up Barkley’s second TD. As for the decisive fourth-down call, Daniels said, ""I’m always a part of, hey let’s go for it."" It was a frustrating night for Daniels and top receiver Terry McLaurin, who exceeded 100 yards receiving in last Sunday’s loss to Pittsburgh for the fourth time in the past eight games, accumulating 113 on five catches. McLaurin had just one catch for 10 yards against the Eagles and cornerback Quinyon Mitchell. ""It happens,"" McLaurin said. ""I can only control what I can.""

The Commanders play four of their next five games at home, starting Nov. 24 against Dallas. They need a breather. While the Eagles had the earliest bye in the NFL in Week 5, the Commanders have the latest in Week 14, and the injuries are piling up after a relatively healthy start to the season.

The 25-year-old Dutchman’s lengthy injury layoff has been marked by setbacks, personal tragedies, and even wild conspiracy theories about his whereabouts. Malacia enjoyed a breakout debut season at Old Trafford in 2022-23, making 39 appearances in all competitions. However, a seemingly minor left knee issue he picked up towards the end of the campaign has kept him sidelined ever since. “I didn’t expect me to do less because I know what I can do,” Malacia said of his first year at United. The very first signing of the Erik ten Hag era proved a reliable, dependable presence, often starting ahead of first-choice Luke Shaw. The problem was a tear in Malacia’s left meniscus. After initial rest and rehabilitation did not resolve the issue, he underwent surgery in July 2023. But further complications arose, forcing him to have a second procedure that reset his recovery timeline. “We had a lot of injuries and my injury needed a lot of attention,” Malacia explained. “So with the medical part, at some point we decided, ‘OK, you need some extra people around you to help you, to be there working with you every day to focus only on you.'” As Malacia’s absence dragged on, wild speculation about his status ran rampant on social media, with some suggesting he had died or even run away with the Princess of Wales. The player chose not to address the rumors, saying: “If it wasn’t my cousin or my mum sending me this, I wouldn’t even know.” Behind the scenes, Malacia was dealing with personal difficulties, including his father’s illness and the death of his grandmother, whom he described as his “second mum.” Coping with these challenges while also rehabbing his knee proved immensely difficult. “I think you have to motivate yourself because if you’re not doing that, the world isn’t going to do it for you,” Malacia said. “If I’m not waking up in the morning… if I’m not working hard enough in the gym, my mum, my dad and my sister can’t do it for me.” Now, after 535 days, Malacia is finally close to making his return. He played the first half for United’s under-21s in the EFL Trophy earlier this month and is targeting a comeback to the first team before the end of the season. “I want to bring the team back on top,” Malacia said. “That’s what the standard has to be at Man United. Even though it’s difficult, you always should aim for the top.” About Author I'm a dedicated Sports Journalist with a nose for latest soccer news, a passion for community journalism and a reputation for impeccable ethics.

Garnacho’s 20-yard strike put United 3-0 up, but the 20-year-old Argentine opted for a subdued fist bump rather than an exuberant celebration. This came after a recent incident where Garnacho was criticized by a fan outside Old Trafford following a Europa League clash. The fan had said: “Garnacho, you’ve got to pass better today, yeah, please? Pass better, score a goal and work on your first touch as well, yeah?” To which Garnacho sarcastically responded: “Why you not playing, man?” On The Overlap panel, Keane was baffled by Garnacho’s decision not to celebrate, telling the group: “If you can’t celebrate a goal there’s something drastically wrong in this game. Whatever’s gone on off the pitch for any player, it could be family stuff. When you get a corner you don’t all celebrate, you’re playing a game to score a goal.” However, Wright offered a different perspective, saying: “For a 20-year-old he’s still going through the journey of what he’s doing. That affected him to the point where he didn’t celebrate. We’re not saying that he shouldn’t celebrate.” The debate grew increasingly animated, with Keane insisting Garnacho should have blocked out the noise and celebrated, while Wright argued the player’s mindset was understandable given the recent incident. Keane concluded: “If he worked in a factory, someone would give him stick in the factory. If a young player can’t enjoy scoring a goal for Man United, you know what he should do? Get a job somewhere else.” The contrasting views from the two pundits highlight the complexities surrounding player celebrations and the potential impact of off-field incidents on a footballer’s mindset.

However, according to reports from Relevo, Perez has been underwhelmed by the 23-year-old’s displays in the opening months of the season. This is not the Mbappe that I bought,” Perez is said to have told manager Carlo Ancelotti. The comments harken back to Perez’s previous remarks when Mbappe opted to extend his contract with Paris Saint-Germain, where he had claimed the player was “not my Mbappe. The main concern for Real Madrid is that Mbappe has not taken on a leadership role within the team, despite being touted as the club’s new superstar. The Spanish giants had hoped the French forward would set the tone and guide his teammates, but he has thus far maintained a low profile. “They feel that Mbappe needs to start setting the tone and paving the way for his teammates,” the report states. Real Madrid had encouraged Mbappe to keep a relatively low profile at the start of his tenure, after he had previously irked the club’s fanbase.

In a statement, the Bundesliga club said Musk has “converted X into a hate machine” since taking over the platform in 2022. St. Pauli accused the billionaire of allowing “racism and conspiracy theories” to spread unchecked, while “insults and threats are seldom sanctioned.” The club also expressed concern that X would be used to “promote authoritarian, misanthropic and far-right content” during upcoming German elections, “manipulating public discourse.” St. Pauli had already scaled back its X presence, using the platform mainly to make political statements supporting diversity. Now, the club said it is ceasing all activity on X, though its content from the past 11 years will remain online. The announcement makes St. Pauli the first team from Europe’s top five leagues to quit the platform under Musk’s leadership. The club urged its followers to switch to the alternative platform Bluesky. Musk purchased X, then Twitter, for $44 billion in 2022, pledging to promote “free speech.” However, his tenure has been marked by layoffs, the reinstatement of banned accounts, and the proliferation of misinformation, angering many users and advertisers.

The Barcelona legend reached 850 official goals, eclipsing Ronaldo’s previous mark in less matches played. However, Messi’s individual achievement was not enough to prevent his team, Inter Miami, from being eliminated from the 2024 MLS Cup playoffs. The Argentine superstar scored a goal against Atlanta United, but Inter Miami fell 2-3 in the third round of the postseason. To be honest, I have myself to blame: in life, in certain things, in football, on a personal level, I now live in the moment, and I think that’s the most important thing,” Ronaldo recently stated, acknowledging Messi’s accomplishment. While Ronaldo still holds the overall record (908), Messi reached his milestone in 1,081 matches, compared to Ronaldo’s 1,179. Messi also boasts more individual accolades, with eight Ballon d’Or titles and eight FIFA World’s Best Player awards, compared to Ronaldo’s five each. In their head-to-head record, Messi has 15 wins, nine draws, and 10 defeats against Ronaldo in competitive club matches. The two superstars have not faced each other in recent years, as they have both moved away from European football. Despite Messi’s historic achievement, his focus remains on helping Inter Miami achieve success in the MLS. The team’s elimination from the playoffs this season will only fuel Messi’s determination to lead the club to greater heights in the future.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on social media on Thursday after it was revealed that the congresswoman took her pronouns out of her bio.","Former college swimmer Riley Gaines joins 'FOX & Friends' to discuss former President Trump's vow to keep transgender athletes out of women's sports during his Fox News town hall. Riley Gaines didn't let Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., off the hook for not using the right pronouns anymore.  The congresswoman was the subject of trending conversation on social media on Thursday when X users discovered that she no longer includes her pronouns ""she/her"" in her bio. Gaines, a former NCAA swimmer and OutKick contributor, got in on the mockery of Ocasio-Cortez on X with multiple posts.  ""They’ll pretend they never embraced (or even celebrated) the insanity. Don’t forget who the compliant, virtue-signaling sheep were,"" Gaines wrote in response to a post that claimed Ocasio-Cortez took the pronouns out of her bio before May of this year.  Gaines later responded to a video that showed Ocasio-Cortez previously apologizing for not including pronouns in her bio next to a photo that showed they were no longer there.  ""We're winning and its glorious,"" Gaines wrote.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., speaks onstage during the first day of the Democratic National Convention at United Center in Chicago on Aug. 19. ( Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Then even later on Thursday, Gaines made one more effort to mock Ocasio-Cortez in a solo post.  ""How will we know what to call AOC now that her pronouns in her bio are gone?!?!?!,"" Gaines wrote.  Gaines previously lambasted Ocasio-Cortez for her stance on trans athletes in women's sports. The Democratic congresswoman has been a frequent advocate for transgender rights and trans inclusion in women's sports during her tenure. Ocasio-Cortez recently spoke out against Green Party vice presidential candidate Butch Ware for saying he did not believe trans athletes should play in women's sports, calling the ticket ""predatory.""  ""AOC says it's predatory behavior to not want men competing in women's sports. To AOC, acknowledging biological reality is ‘predatory’ You know what's actually predatory? Sexualizing children and normalizing pedophilia,"" Gaines wrote on X while posting a Fox News Digital article about Ocasio-Cortez' comments. Ocasio-Cortez has taken a partisan stance in her support of transgender rights and protections.  After the Biden-Harris administration passed a sweeping reform to Title IX in April that aimed to provide more protection for gender identity in schools and universities, Ocasio-Cortez argued the reform did not go far enough in favor of transgender people and, specifically, transgender athletes who want to compete in women's sports. ""Absolutely no reason for the Biden admin to do this. It is indefensible and embarrassing. The admin can still walk this back, and they should. It’s a disgrace,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote in response to a report that the change would allow schools to bar transgender athletes from women's and girls' sports.  The administration issued a sweeping rule that clarified that Title IX’s ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions."" And while the administration insisted the regulation does not address athletic eligibility, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that it would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.  Still, that wasn't good enough for Ocasio-Cortez.  INSIDE SAN JOSE STATE'S POLICE BATTLE TO PROTECT WOMEN'S ATHLETES THREATENED BY A TRANSGENDER CULTURE WAR Former competitive swimmer Riley Gaines speaks during a campaign rally for former President Trump at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale, Arizona, on Aug. 23. (Rebecca Noble/Getty Images) Ocasio-Cortez has also co-sponsored the Equality Act, which was proposed in 2019 and has had revisions that ""would force public schools to allow biologically male athletes who identify as transgender on girls' sports teams."" In March 2023, Democrats, including Ocasio-Cortez, advocated for a transgender bill of rights, proposing a resolution ""recognizing that it is the duty of the Federal Government to develop and implement a Transgender Bill of Rights.""  The resolution specifically called for a federal law to ensure that biological men can ""participate in sports on teams and in programs that best align with their gender identity [and] use school facilities that best align with their gender identity."" Meanwhile, Gaines has passionately fought against trans inclusion in women's sports as a former college swimmer who infamously tied with trans athlete Lia Thomas at the NCAA championships in 2022.  Gaines shared her harrowing recollection of her experience being forced to share a locker room with Thomas at a Trump campaign rally on Oct. 23.  ""I could share the grotesque details of what it was like being forced to undress, inches away from a 6-foot-4 man who watched us strip down to nothing, while he did the same, exposing his fully-intact naked male body,"" Gaines said. ""There are no words to describe the violation and the betrayal, the humiliation that we felt.""  Gaines leads a lawsuit against the NCAA with other female athletes, accusing the governing body of violating their Title IX rights due to its policies on gender identity.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Riley Gaines is sworn in during a House Oversight Subcommittee on Health Care and Financial Services hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 5, 2023. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, details the shock Gaines and other swimmers felt when they learned they would have to share a locker room with Thomas at the 2022 championships in Atlanta. It documents a number of races they swam with Thomas, including the 200-yard final in which Thomas and Gaines tied for fifth but Thomas, not Gaines, was handed the fifth-place trophy. Meanwhile, many other Democrats have backed off from their support for transgender inclusion in women's sports prior to and after the election.  Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass, and Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., spoke out against trans inclusion in a New York Times article.  Moulton's comments have incited a flury of backlash against him from Democratic allies who have deemed his words ""transphobic.""

Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said Tuesday that the Democratic Party was 'talking down' to Americans in response to backlash over his recent comments about transgender women in sports. Massachusetts Democrats are planning a rally for transgender rights after Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., spoke out against trans athletes in women's sports.  The rally will take place on Sunday in Moulton's hometown of Salem, where he was born in 1978, according to Salem City Councilor Kyle Davis.  ""In the wake of Trump's election and Seth Moulton's recent transphobic comments, I am working with local LGBT organizations and local leaders on a large rally in Salem outside of Moulton's office,"" Davis told Fox News Digital.  ""This rally is meant to express first and foremost to the trans community that we stand in solidarity with them but also to communicate to Seth Moulton that we do not agree with his stance and his willingness to throw this community under the bus.""

Lee/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) Moulton incited fierce backlash by Democrat allies and liberals at large after he made comments in a New York Times article last week after President-elect Trump's election victory. Moulton spoke out against his own party for making too much of an effort to champion for trans inclusion in women's sports, and blamed it as a reason for losing the election.  ""I have two little girls. I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that,"" Moulton said.  Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., also spoke out against trans inclusion in the same article.  Moulton has since defended and doubled-down on his comments amid the backlash by his own party.  Davis previously called for Moulton to resign in a post on X.  ""I’m not looking for an apology from [Moulton], I’m looking for a resignation,"" Davis said. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called the remarks ""offensive"" during a recent interview on CNN. Meanwhile, Massachusetts state Rep. Manny Cruz suggested Moulton's stance was ""a betrayal,"" and Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge also condemned Moulton and discouraged other Democrats in his state from following Moulton's lead in posts on X.  INSIDE SAN JOSE STATE'S POLICE BATTLE TO PROTECT WOMEN'S ATHLETES THREATENED BY A TRANSGENDER CULTURE WAR Tufts University said it was severing internship ties with Rep.

Moulton himself appeared to confirm the situation on Tuesday morning, but Tufts University has denied limiting internship opportunities with his office. The source told Fox News Digital, however, that Moulton’s office had been contacted by Tufts University Political Science Department Chair David Art on the matter. Moulton addressed the alleged issue with Tufts on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""Imagine if one of these Tuft students actually wants to intern in a Republican office? I mean, what would these political science professors do then? This is just everything that is wrong with this cancel culture,"" Moulton responded.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., attacked the Green Party presidential ticket after the party's vice presidential nominee, Butch Ware, spoke out against transgender athletes in women's sports. Ocasio-Cortez called the ticket ""predatory"" in response to Ware's stance. In June, a survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago asked respondents to weigh in on whether transgender athletes of both sexes should be permitted to participate in sports leagues that correspond to their preferred gender identity instead of their biological sex.  Sixty-five percent answered that it should be never or rarely allowed. When those polled were asked specifically about adult transgender female athletes competing on women’s sports teams, 69% opposed it.

2069,Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Packers legend Clay Matthews admits Aaron Rodgers' struggles with Jets have been 'hard to watch' this season,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/packers-legend-clay-matthews-admits-aaron-rodgers-struggles-jets-has-been-hard-watch-season,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 14:24:24 -0500","Clay Matthews, the Packers Hall of Famer who spent many years terrorizing teams with Aaron Rodgers, admits it&apos;s been frustrating to watch his old teammate with the New York Jets.","Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. For 10 seasons, Clay Matthews and Aaron Rodgers were key members of the Green Bay Packers, leading the way on their respective sides of the ball.  Matthews, the feared outside linebacker who was inducted into the Packers Hall of Fame, has since retired from the game. But Rodgers, the four-time MVP quarterback, continues playing with the New York Jets.  The success these two had together — a Super Bowl in 2011 included — is a departure from what Rodgers is seeing in New York. The Jets have not lived up to the hype since he was traded from Green Bay to New York last season.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Green Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews, left, points to Super Bowl MVP Aaron Rodgers after giving him a championship belt after the win against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Super Bowl at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Feb. 6, 2011. (Imagn) Matthews spoke to Fox News Digital this week, admitting it's hard to watch his friend and former teammate struggle.  ""It is tough for me to watch because there’s no bigger fan of Aaron than me,"" Matthews said while also discussing his upcoming appearance at Lambeau Field with the Crown Royal Rig Thanksgiving Day. ""I enjoy watching the Jets. Obviously, Davante’s been over there. I mean, they have star power up and down the offense, but, unfortunately, they just haven’t been clicking. It’s hard to watch."" With Rodgers healed from his Achilles injury suffered on the fourth snap of the 2023 season, the expectation was the Jets would break out of their 13-year playoff drought.  AARON RODGERS PINPOINTS JETS' BIGGEST HURDLE: ‘IT’S US AGAINST US' Instead, they find themselves at 3-7 through 10 games, needing to virtually win out to have a legitimate shot at doing so.  As Matthews mentioned, the star power is vast when it comes to the Jets' offense, with Davante Adams, an old friend of theirs from the Packers, the latest to join the group after a trade with the Las Vegas Raiders.  But the old connection that was so lethal in Green Bay with Rodgers has yet to break out with the Jets. And prior to Adams' arrival, Rodgers just hasn't found the consistency he'd like, and the record shows it.  The Jets are 26th in total offense (298.5 yards per game) and 17th in passing yards per game (211.7). New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers throws against the Arizona Cardinals during the first half Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz.  (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) As Rodgers said on his weekly appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show,"" the Jets' biggest hurdle is ""it's us against us,"" and Matthews knows Rodgers will be trying to lead by example behind closed doors.  ""I'm not sure much words are going to help,"" Matthews said.  ""I think he’s just staying the course. I mean, for a guy who’s a 20-year vet, he’s been through everything. He’s battle tested, and he’s obviously still one of the best. He can make all the throws. So, I don’t know what the moral needs to be. You constantly hear the quotes of them coming out flat and what not. At this point, I’m not sure much words are going to help as far as, ‘We need to pick it up.’  ""The Jets, it’s been a while since they’ve been in the playoffs.  It’s been a while since I’m sure they’ve had a winning season. It needs to change, but, unfortunately, I don’t know if this is the year. Perhaps maybe they pick it up towards the latter part, but it’s tough sledding when the future looks to be bleak."" Does the future past the 2024 campaign involve Rodgers? He's under contract for the 2025 season, but none of the compensation is guaranteed. Rodgers could also choose to retire.  Matthews can't see that happening, though, especially with the way this season has been going.  Former Green Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews speaks during a press conference before the 2024 Packers Hall of Fame induction banquet Aug. 29, 2024, at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis. (Imagn) ""Aaron’s too much of a competitor. We’ll see how he feels. Obviously, coming back after that Achilles, it seems to be behind him now. Dealing with some knee and hamstring issues that limited his mobility,"" Matthews said. ""I know my last year in Green Bay, I wanted to come back and finish on a high note or at least continue it. As a competitor, you have to have that look in the mirror, so to speak. But I still think he can make all the throws and do what he needs to do.""  GIVING BACK WITH CROWN ROYAL While Matthews is a Jets fan when it comes to supporting Rodgers, he will always be a Packer, which is why he teamed up with Crown Royal, the official whiskey sponsor of the NFL, in its fourth year of the Kick Off with Crown program.  This year, Crown Royal launched its one-of-a-kind tailgate on wheels with the Crown Royal Rig, a purple 18-wheeler touring NFL stadiums to not just wow NFL fans with players like Matthews, but to also support the military.  Matthews talked about his excitement about not only being able to return to Lambeau to mingle with Packers fans on Thanksgiving night before his former team’s game against the Miami Dolphins, but also why this tailgate is so important. Fans will be putting together care packages for military members with Crown Royal’s longtime partner, Packages From Home. The 18-wheeler Crown Royal Rig is traveling the country to different NFL stadiums to help the military. (Crown Royal) ""I think what’s even more important is how Crown Royal is giving back to the military community, specifically with their Purple Bag Project,"" Matthews said. ""Giving away morale-boosting items to our military by giving them the packages from home.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The Packers get a primetime game on Thanksgiving.

He told Fox News Digital he is donating his paycheck to Tunnel to Towers.,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Eric Bischoff will be back and better than ever – at least for one night. The legendary pro wrestling figure will take control of the Major League Wrestling (MLW) One Shot event in New York City on Dec. 5. He told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview he would donate his entire paycheck to the Tunnel to Towers Foundation. ""One of the things I told (MLW founder Court Bauer) right away was this isn’t about the money,"" Bischoff said. ""He started to negotiate my fee and I really wasn’t interested in negotiating it, I just said whatever it is, I’m going to donate it to Tunnel to Towers.

I just want whatever it is to be donated because I’m not doing this for the money. I’m doing it for the fun."" Bischoff will be calling the shots for the one night of pro wrestling at the Melrose Ballroom in Queens. He said he talked to Bauer for several years about doing a show with MLW, but the timing was just never right. Then, the stars aligned. Paul Walter Hauser, an actor-turned-MLW wrestler, joined Bischoff on the wrestling mogul’s YouTube show ""Life Choices."" As the two discussed the business, Hauser called Bauer live and the dominoes fell into place from there. Talented pro wrestlers have moved through the company, including Alex Shelley, Austin Aries, Lexis King (then known as Brian Pillman Jr.), Francine, Gangrel, Jacob Fatu, Karrion Kross (then known as Killer Kross), Konnan, Matt Cardona, MJF, Tajiri and several others.  FROM ACTING TO THE SQUARED CIRCLE, EMMY WINNER HAUSER IS READY TO RUMBLE FOR MAJOR LEAGUE WRESTLING Eric Bischoff was formerly the head of World Championship Wrestling. (Major League Wrestling) The roster now includes established talents like KENTA, Matt Riddle, Satoshi Kojima, Mistico, Minoru Suzuki, Bobby Fish and The Andersons, among others. Donovan Dijak also made his debut with the company over the summer after his contract with WWE was not renewed. ""They’re obviously attracting some great talent. Court, as a former writer in WWE, understands the art of storytelling. I love the fact that they’re the underdog, and they’re kind of, of course, building this brand from the ground up. ""And, I love watching emerging companies – whether it’s in the wrestling business or anything else. I’m just fascinated with the prospect of MLW growing and reaching the next level or whatever it may be for them."" Bischoff has been behind some of the most interesting creative angles in pro wrestling history, as he helped establish the New World Order faction in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which saw Hulk Hogan go from the good guy to a heel, joining the likes of Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, collectively known as The Outsiders. The decision sparked the ""Monday Night Wars"" with WWE (then known as the World Wrestling Federation) and put WCW on top for more than a year in the ratings battle. In the end, WCW flamed out, but Bischoff’s influence in the business was far from cooled. He joined WWE to become the on-air general manager of the RAW brand and was also an executive producer for Total Nonstop Action wrestling. EX-WWE STAR DONOVAN DIJAK MAKES ELECTRIC MAJOR LEAGUE WRESTLING DEBUT: 'EXECUTION WAS FLAWLESS' Eric Bischoff will take over creative for Major League Wrestling for one night. (Major League Wrestling) Bischoff told Fox News Digital he is already starting to enjoy getting back into the creative aspect of the wrestling business and is looking forward to creating a show. It does not exactly mean he is looking for a return in the long run. ""I don’t even think about that,"" he said. ""One of the things I told Court is that for me to do something in wrestling now, it has to be fun. If it’s not fun for me, if it’s just a job, or if it’s just a payday, I’m really not that interested. … When it comes to putting my toe back in the water in wrestling, my first priority is that it has to be fun. If it’s not fun, I’m not interested. ""So it all depends. I honestly, to be very transparent about it, I can’t see it. I like my life just the way it is. I live in a beautiful part of the country out in the middle of nowhere where I can look out my back window and see Yellowstone National Park. …  ""So, for me to commit – just committing to professional wrestling is 24 hours, seven days a week. If you’re not doing it, you’re thinking about it. If you’re not thinking about it, you’re worrying about it. If you’re not worrying about it, you’re sleeping. It’s hard for me to imagine. But again, it depends how much fun I have. If it’s successful and everybody, not just me, but if the audience enjoys, if Court and his team – most importantly- enjoy the process, then, you know, anything’s possible. But highly unlikely. Let’s put it that way."" Eric Bischoff attends SiriusXM's ""Busted Open"" celebrating their 10th anniversary In New York City on the eve of WrestleMania 35 on April 6, 2019 in New York City.

Senior leadership will lie to you and say that they do not know, but if you ask the DSA crew leads and specialists what they are experiencing in the field, they will tell you.  Marn'i said withholding [checks notes] federal assistance from the majority of her countrymen in Florida was justified because [checks notes again] those people who vote differently than her would have been hostile (she just knows this in her soul). Do you think she's telling the truth about the widespread avoidance of Trump supporters, or is she just trying to deflect heat? And if her allegations are true and critical aid was withheld from destroyed communities in states like North Carolina, where over a hundred people are dead, was the withholding of such aid responsible for any of these deaths??

(The following video is from 2016, but it works here so I'm leaving it.)  Multiple outlets have begun reporting that Trump is making his picks, starting with Florida Senator Marco Rubio as Secretary of State. President-elect Trump is expected to nominate Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida as Secretary of State, a source familiar tells Fox News.The source noted that while Trump could still change his mind at the last minute, as of now he's planning on offering the job to Rubio, the three-term senator whom the former president considered as his running mate this summer before naming Sen. JD Vance as the GOP vice presidential nominee ...Rubio, who sits on both the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, has taken similar positions to Trump on international conflicts, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Israel's war with Hamas.In April, the 53-year-old senator voted against the $95 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine and has urged the eastern European nation to negotiate an end to its war with Russia.

In April, the 53-year-old senator voted against the $95 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine and has urged the eastern European nation to negotiate an end to its war with Russia. Yes, it seems like Rubio has begun aligning himself with the Trump agenda when it comes to foreign conflicts, and he appears to be on the fast track to the Secretary of State position. The other reported pick is a bit more out of left field: South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as the Director of Homeland Security.  Noem would replace the utterly awful Alejandro Mayorkas in overseeing Customs and Border Patrol, FEMA, ICE, and the Secret Service. And if there is anyone who is going to run their department as a Trump loyalist who will fight for the President's agenda, you can expect Noem to do so. Other key positions reportedly filled by the President-elect include: Chief of Staff: Susie Wiles, Trump's 2024 campaign manager. National Security Adviser: Mike Waltz, 3-term Florida Congressman, National Guard veteran, and former Pentagon policy adviser. Border Czar: Tom Homan.  (Enough said.) United Nations Ambassador: Elise Stefanik, Congresswoman, New York. MAGA Republican. Third-ranking member of Congress after replacing Liz Cheney as House Republican Conference Chair. Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy: Stephen Miller. Yes, that Stephen Miller. The man behind Trump's immigration agenda since 2015. Environmental Protection Agency: Lee Zeldin, Congressman, New York. MAGA Republican. A mix of insiders and outsiders, but, so far, there's no doubt that all of these folks are Trump picks and Trump loyalists, which appears to be his primary motivation for selecting his cabinet.

The GOP really did a number this year, my friends: Republicans saved some of their most vulnerable incumbents, like Reps. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) and David Valadao (R-Calif.), while defeating several vulnerable Democratic incumbents. State Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-Pa.) unseated Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.), while businessman Rob Bresnahan defeated Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.). With control of the White House, both chambers of Congress, and a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court (and potential chances to expand that number in the next 4 years), the MAGA platform has a very rare window of opportunity to enact its reforms.

Domski worked for Blue Cross Blue Shield in the state for 30 years, and was 100% remote during the pandemic (as well as 75% remote previously) while working as an IT specialist. Despite requesting a religious exemption for the Covid vax, Blue Cross refused, triggering a lawsuit from Domski, who claimed she was a victim of religious discrimination. Her attorney, Jon Marko, said this in a statement: Our forefathers fought and died for the freedom for each American to practice his or her own religion. Neither the government nor a corporation has a right to force an individual to choose between his or her career and conscience. Lisa refused to renounce her faith and beliefs and was wrongfully terminated from the only job she had ever known. The jury's verdict today tells BCBSM that religious discrimination has no place in America and affirms each person's right to religious freedom.  The jury awarded Domski $10 million in punitive damages, $1.7 million in lost wages, and $1 million in noneconomic damages. Meanwhile, Blue Cross is super sad that their corporate HR tyranny got slapped down: While Blue Cross respects the jury process and thanks the individual jurors for their service, we are disappointed in the verdict. Blue Cross is reviewing its legal options and will determine its path forward in the coming days.  Follow Ian on Substack or X (@ighaworth).

Not only is he leaving CNN, the fakest of the fake news, but he seems to be done with old media as a whole.
