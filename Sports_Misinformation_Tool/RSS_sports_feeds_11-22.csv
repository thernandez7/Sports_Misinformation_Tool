"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Daniel Jones Released From New York Giants: Where Will He Sign Next?,https://deadspin.com/daniel-jones-released-from-new-york-giants-where-will-he-sign-next/,2024-11-22T17:08:18.943Z,"The New York Giants have released quarterback Daniel Jones who is expected to clear waivers and become a free agent, these four teams could show inter","On Friday morning, the New York Giants announced that they’ve released quarterback Daniel Jones. Jones asked Giants President John Mara for his release on Friday morning, according to a statement, and they mutually agreed that it would be best for him and the team. Obviously, this news comes after the Giants decided to demote Jones to their fourth-string quarterback, rolling with Tommy DeVito as the starter, likely due to injury guarantees in Jones’ pricey contract. It’s probable that Jones will clear waivers because of that contract. But where will he end up? Let’s take a look at teams that could bring him in. The Raiders are probably better than their 2-8 record indicates. Much of that has to do with their revolving door at quarterback between Aidan O’Connell and Gardner Minshew.  The Raiders gave up on Davante Adams when they traded him to the New York Jets, practically waving the white flag this season. But the best part about a lost season? It allows you the opportunity to try something new.  Adding Jones to the underwhelming mix of O’Connell and Minshew will at least give the Raiders a look at a player that could be their bridge to Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders or Miami’s Cam Ward, who will likely be drafted to Las Vegas in the 2025 NFL Draft. Can we stop and appreciate just how funny this would be?  By this point, everybody knows that the Giants made the massive mistake of letting Saquon Barkley walk in free agency and sign with their division rival. Now the Eagles have a chance to double dip and sign Barkley’s old buddy Jones, who would be a serviceable insurance policy behind Jalen Hurts.  Hurts’ current backup is Kenny Pickett, so it’s unlikely they gamble on another reclamation project with Jones, but the Eagles have the opportunity to do the funniest thing ever. Oh, you thought we were done being funny? Not so fast. Dak Prescott is out for the year, and this Cowboys season is already a joke. The absolute best outcome would be for the Cowboys to sign Jones. Do yourself a favor and look up who the Cowboys play on Thanksgiving Day. You guessed it. The Giants. Right after the election, nobody wants to hear their drunk uncle yap about politics. The Cowboys can save us from that nightmare and let Danny Dimes turn loose against his old team. Remember that beautiful thing about lost seasons? That you can try something new? That applies for the Tennessee Titans as well. Brian Callahan’s first season as head coach with the Titans has not gone as planned. Will Levis and Mason Rudolph are the only two quarterbacks in that room, and neither of those players appears to be the answer.  The Titans will have a great draft pick, but this is an underwhelming quarterback class. Perhaps Jones could serve as the bridge quarterback to 2026 in Tennessee. Copyright 2024"

The league announced the switch on Friday. In May 2023, NFL owners approved moving a maximum of two Thursday night games scheduled in Weeks 13 through 17. It was to be a trial program for the 2023 season but extended to 2024 if no games were flexed in the earlier year. None were. Entering Week 12 play, both the Chargers (7-3) and the Broncos (6-5) sit in wild-card position, with the Kansas City Chiefs (9-1) penciled into a spot as well as leaders of the AFC West. The Bengals (4-7) have a playoff probability of 13 percent, while the chances of the Browns (3-8) stand at less than 1 percent, according to the NFL. Both teams already have played a Prime Video game this season. The Bengals lost to the Baltimore Ravens 35-34 in a Lamar Jackson vs. Joe Burrow classic on Nov. 7, while the Browns beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 24-19 after scoring a touchdown on a snow-covered field in Cleveland on Thursday. Under the agreement struck with owners, the NFL can flex games by giving teams at least 28 days' notice.  The leaves only the Week 17 game scheduled between Seattle and Chicago on Dec. 26 eligible to be flexed. Entering Week 12 play, the Seahawks are 5-5 and the Bears sit 4-6. The most attractive option on the schedule for a potential flex is the showdown between NFC North rivals Green Bay and Minnesota. The Packers (7-3) and Vikings (8-2) currently are in wild-card position. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Martino confirmed reports that he was voluntarily leaving his position due to personal reasons and said he is returning to his native Argentina.  Per Inter Miami, the club's search for a new head coach is underway and is ""expected to conclude in the near future."" Multiple outlets, however, reported that Argentina under-20 coach Javier Mascherano will be named as the head coach of Inter Miami for the 2025 season. Martino guided the Lionel Messi-starring club to 74 points (22-4-8) and the Supporters' Shield in the regular season, but Inter Miami fell short in the MLS Cup Playoffs. The club was eliminated in the first round by No. 9 seed Atlanta United. Martino said he made his decision to step down prior to the team's loss to Atlanta. ""It has been an honor to work at such a special club and to lead such a special team,"" Martino said Friday. ""I've enjoyed my stay at Inter Miami and will treasure the memories made and relationships forged here for the rest of my life. ""I depart with nothing but gratitude for my time here and would like to offer sincere thanks to everyone who made it possible."" Martino, 61, joined Inter Miami in June 2023 after three-plus years at the helm of Mexico's national team. He left that role after Mexico failed to advance out of group play in the 2022 World Cup for the first time in nearly 45 years. Inter Miami won the Leagues Cup 2023 tournament after the arrival of Martino and superstars Messi and Sergio Busquets that summer. ""Tata will forever have a special place in Inter Miami history,"" Inter Miami managing owner Jorge Mas said. ""He guided us through a period of transformation and brought us our first titles in the process, which is what we aspire to as an ambitious organization. More importantly, he led Inter Miami with the unimpeachable class and professionalism. His contributions to our club have been immense, and we thank him for that, but above all, for who he is as a human being."" Previously, Martino led Atlanta United to the MLS Cup title in 2018. He chose not to renew his contract after that season, again citing personal reasons. Mascherano, 40, coached Argentina at the 2024 Paris Olympics, with the team losing in the quarterfinals. He was a longtime teammate of Messi both internationally and with FC Barcelona.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

We are all disappointed in how things have worked out. We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him. We wish him nothing but the best in the future."" Jones was demoted to a scout team safety in Thursday's practice, three days after head coach Brian Daboll made the decision to turn to former undrafted free agent Tommy DeVito as the team's starting quarterback. The Giants (2-8) have lost five in a row and reside in the cellar of the NFC East. ""The opportunity to play for the New York Giants was truly a dream come true and I am extremely grateful ... for the chance to play here,"" Jones said Thursday. ""The Giants are truly a first-class organization and I have nothing but genuine respect and appreciation for the people who built it and who help carry on the tradition. I've met so many special people and created relationships that will truly last a lifetime. Thank you to all my teammates, coaches and staff that have done so much for me these past six years. There have been some great times, but of course we all wish there had been more of those."" Ranked 32nd among all qualified quarterbacks in passer rating this season, Jones has eight touchdowns and seven interceptions in 2024. He also carried an injury guarantee worth $23 million for this season that the Giants didn't want to risk paying only to likely cut ties with him in the offseason. Jones, 27, was a first-round pick in 2019 and signed a four-year, $160 million contract in 2023. He suffered a season-ending ACL tear last season but returned in time to start the season as the No. 1 quarterback. He was benched with a record of 3-13 over his past 16 starts. The remainder of Jones' contract partially can be wiped off the books with his release before March 2025. ""I take full responsibility for my part in not bringing more wins. No one wanted to win more games worse than me and I gave everything I had on the field and in my preparation,"" Jones continued. ""Of course, this season has been disappointing for all, and of course I wish I could've done more. I'm 100 percent accountable for my part. I did not play well enough, consistently enough help the team get the results. The reality of the NFL is it's hard to win games and requires consistent performance from everyone involved. We didn't do that well enough so the idea to change something happens, and I understand. ""I love the game, I love being part of a team and I'm excited for the next opportunity. I know that there's a lot of good football in front of me and I'm excited about that,"" Jones said. ""To all fans, I have deep respect and appreciation for your passion and love for the Giants. The fans are huge part of what makes playing for the Giants so special."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Hoyas entered the season with plenty of questions as to who would play where and when under second-year coach Ed Cooley. Georgetown retained just two starters and welcomed 14 new players after last year's 9-23 finish. Jayden Epps predictably has been solid so far his second season with the Hoyas, averaging 15.3 points per game, but two newcomers have provided Cooley some much-needed stability early on. Freshman forward Thomas Sorber logged two double-doubles in his first four games and leads Georgetown (3-1) in both scoring (17.8 points per game) and rebounding (9.5). TCU transfer guard Micah Peavy averages 12 points and is shooting 48.7 percent from the field.  The duo combined for 26 points, 16 boards and nine assists in Wednesday's 79-51 home win over Mount St. Mary's.  The blowout also let Cooley substitute players who need more experience ahead of the Hoyas' Big East opener against Creighton on Dec. 18. All four reserves who checked in logged at least 14 minutes. ""We purposely wanted to cut our rotation a little bit to get a little bit more chemistry and synergy, and I thought our young guys did a really good job,"" Cooley said. Saturday could bring more opportunities for Georgetown's inexperienced players to get valuable minutes. The Red Flash (2-4) have dropped four of their five road games this season, including a 66-58 setback to Mount St. Mary's last Saturday. Each of St. Francis' other three road losses have come by at least 26 points. ""We are good about digging ourselves into holes, especially on the road,"" Red Flash coach Rob Kimmel said. ""I told the guys to leave the shovels behind as we prepare for Georgetown.""  St. Francis put the shovels to good use during Wednesday's home opener, burying Division III Penn State-Schuylkill 96-57 to snap a two-game skid. Jeremy Clayville hit 6 of 10 3-pointers off the bench and had a team-leading 21 points, while fellow reserves Miles Webb and Chris Moncrief scored 17 points apiece. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

ESPN plans to tape the live-audience studio show, ""They Call It Late Night with Jason Kelce,"" on Fridays starting Jan. 3 through the end of the NFL playoffs -- a five-week stretch that would serve as a test run for the retired All-Pro center and big brother to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.  The first four episodes will air at 1 a.m. ET starting Jan. 4 and re-air on ESPN2 and Kelce's YouTube channels. ""I loved late-night shows, I've always loved them. I remember sleepovers watching Conan O'Brien with my friends. We're going to have a bunch of guys up there -- legends of the game, friends that I played with, coaches, celebrities,"" Jason Kelce said Thursday night on an appearance with Kimmel. Jason Kelce, 37, joined ""Monday Night Countdown"" on ESPN at the start of this season. The show will be recorded in Philadelphia at Union Transfer with live music. NFL Films' first full-length film, ""They Call It Pro Football,"" had deep Philly roots. Philadelphia TV personality John Facenda became the voice of NFL Films and narrated that film, from which the title of Jason Kelce's new show was created. The Kelce brothers share a popular podcast and YouTube channels. Jason Kelce is not playing in the NFL for the first time since being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the sixth round of the 2011 draft.

The Bearcats are 4-0 -- the third time they've done that in coach Wes Miller's four seasons at the helm -- and are coming off a 76-60 win over Northern Kentucky on Tuesday. Still, Cincinnati has played only one road game and has not faced an opponent with the Atlantic Coast Conference pedigree of Georgia Tech. But the Yellow Jackets (2-2) have had their own issues, particularly on defense, and were beaten by rival Georgia 77-69 on Nov. 15 in their most recent game. Cincinnati passed its first road test on Tuesday, and Miller liked what he saw. ""That was good for us,"" he said. ""I thought we got better and there were a lot of things we can learn from."" The Bearcats got 18 points from Simas Lukosius against Northern Kentucky; he was 6-for-9 on 3-pointers and hit all five attempts in the second half. Lukosius leads the team with an average of 17.8 points and has made 69.6 percent of his 3-pointers, good for fourth in the NCAA. ""People have asked how he's been playing and if I'm surprised,"" Miller said. ""I don't put stock in a game or two, but I see him every day, and I'm not surprised because he continues to work on his game and gets better every day."" The Bearcats are without Dan Skillings Jr., who had minor knee surgery Nov. 11 and could return to practice next week. He had 17 points and 11 rebounds in the opener, but his knee was swollen the next day and surgery was performed. The Bearcats' other top players are Jizzle James (averaging 14 points per game), Dillon Mitchell (12 points, team-leading 8 rebounds) and Arrinten Page (10.3 points). Day Day Thomas played 14 minutes in his season debut Tuesday and contributed four assists and two points. Thomas broke his foot during the NIT in the spring and had not played since. ""Having Day Day back was such a lift for our team,"" Miller said. ""I thought he was really good at times defensively. He puts so much more pressure on the point with his ability to drive."" Georgia Tech is coming off a loss to Georgia in which it set season lows for points (69), field-goal percentage (36.5), 3-point field goals (six) and assists (11), but a high for fouls committed (28). The Yellow Jackets have had trouble scoring, making just 37.2 percent from the field over the past two games. Baye Ndongo leads the team in scoring (15.8 ppg) and is tied with Luke O'Brien for the lead in rebounding (8.0). Ndongo has scored in double digits every game. Lance Terry averages 14 ppg. Doryan Onwuchekwa has started the past two games and totaled 20 rebounds, including 11 against Georgia. ""A lot of times I think we're our own worst enemy,"" Georgia Tech coach Damon Stoudamire said.

For the first time since 2020, the Boilermakers lost a regular season, non-conference game when they fell to No. 15 Marquette 76-58 on Tuesday in Milwaukee. But the early-season setback is all part of the learning curve that Purdue coach Matt Painter wants the Boilermakers (4-1) to go through before Big Ten play begins.  ""Our first three games, we weren't lights out,"" Painter said. ""(Then) we played really well against Alabama. We weren't great before that. So we're trying to find ourselves, trying to find some consistency. But this is what you want. Because we get thrown into (Big Ten play) at Penn State and Maryland in December. You want to be able to get off to a good start in the league; that's a little easier said than done. I just believe if you've got a good enough team, you need to go out and get challenged, even if you've got to take a couple on the chin.  ""That way, when you get into the NCAA Tournament, you've done everything in your power as a coach to help."" Trey Kaufman-Renn leads the Boilermakers in scoring and rebounding with averages of 17.6 and 6.6, respectively. Fletcher Loyer is averaging a second-best 16.2 points per game, and Braden Smith is next at 14.6. Purdue has shot 50.6 percent from the field and 43.8 percent from 3-point range. The Boilermakers had 15 turnovers at Marquette while the Golden Eagles had just six.  ""We need to start by taking care of the basketball,"" Painter said. ""One of the things that probably jumps out for us is I don't think we're as good as Marquette defensively. So, in practice, we don't see that. Doesn't mean we don't have athletic players, doesn't mean we don't have good players. But they have a more experienced defensive group. So we've got to grow at taking care of the basketball."" A well-rested Marshall (3-1) most recently played last Saturday, knocking off Bellarmine 83-62. Nate Martin led the Thundering Herd with 23 points and nine rebounds. Jalen Speer came off the bench to tally 20 points, and Obinna Anochili-Killen added 15 points and nine rebounds.   Marshall used an 11-player rotation. Thundering Herd coach Cornelius Jackson said team depth is a strength Marshall will draw on throughout the season.  ""I feel like we are a deep team,"" he said. ""Each one of our guys can step in and play a role."" As leader of a mid-major team from the Sun Belt Conference, Jackson said he reminded his players there likely will be more fans than they are accustomed to in Mackey Arena on Saturday and therefore it will be louder, but it's still just a basketball game.  ""The rims are the same size, the court is the same size,"" Jackson said. ""The seats might be a little different, but at the end of the day, it's still basketball. Every guy on our team has played for a long time."" -- Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Marquette will make the journey for just the one game, while Georgia will take on No. 22 St. John's at the Atlantis Paradise Island Resort on Sunday. The Golden Eagles (5-0) are coming off their first marquee win of the season, 76-58 at home over No. 6 Purdue on Tuesday. After the Boilermakers tied the game at 12 with 12:31 left in the first half, Stevie Mitchell's layup gave Marquette a lead it never surrendered. Mitchell scored a career-high 21 points, while Kam Jones became just the third Golden Eagle to ever record a triple-double, chipping in 17 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists, as Marquette snapped Purdue's 39-game regular-season, non-conference winning streak -- the fourth-longest in NCAA history. A rarity in this era of college sports, Jones and Mitchell are two seniors who have stuck with the program for four years. The duo will look to help Marquette to its first 6-0 start since 2011-12, when it began the year 10-0. ""(Jones) has worked his tail off,"" Marquette coach Shaka Smart said. ""He's always had better ability as a playmaker than some might think, but his role was a little different when we had Tyler Kolek and Oso Ighodaro, because those guys were such good passers. We still need him to score, but he also has the ball in his hands more, and we need him to create opportunities for other guys."" As for Mitchell, Smart said he helps to make the team run. ""I don't think until Stevie graduates and moves on will we fully feel what we have in him,"" the coach said. ""I just encourage everyone to enjoy this year while we have him here. He's a combination of will, toughness, heart, and he's extremely smart."" Jones leads the team with averages 22.6 points and 6 assists per game, while Mitchell chips in 13.6 points per contest. Standing in the way of Marquette's potential 6-0 start is a Georgia team that's seen little resistance to begin the year. The Bulldogs (5-0) have won their first five games by an average score of 87 to 66.6, most recently blowing out Alabama A&M at home Tuesday, 93-45. Led in scoring by Asa Newell (16.8 points per game) and sophomore guard Silas Demary Jr. (14.6), the Bulldogs are off to their best start since beginning 7-0 in 2020-21. Georgia's hot streak will be tested in the Bahamas, as coach Mike White's team will see its first big challenge on Saturday. ""Marquette will demand our attention and respect. It's a great program,"" White said. ""Shaka has done a phenomenal job up there, and from what I've heard on the outside looking in, they've got a good culture and really good players. It'll be a high-level game and a good opportunity to see where we're at."" The two programs have met three times, most recently a 73-66 Georgia win in Milwaukee on Dec. 2, 2017. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

That isn’t good news for the Steelers, whose stingy defense let them down during an embarrassing 24-19 loss to the Browns on Thursday night. Cleveland had dropped seven of its previous eight games ahead of the meeting with Pittsburgh. Opponents averaged only 16.2 points over the Steelers’ first 10 games of the season before the Browns stuck Pittsburgh (8-3) with its third loss. Bad games happen, and one usually isn’t a cause for concern as long as it gets flushed out of the system relatively quickly. But what Thursday showed was just how reliant the Steelers have been on their defense, and once it cracks, the team as a whole does, too. Pittsburgh has really only gone blow-for-blow with an opposing team twice this season, posting a 1-1 record in those contests. The Steelers fell 20-17 in a back-and-forth affair with the Dallas Cowboys back on Oct. 6, then proved that they do in fact have what it takes to prevail in a shootout by edging the Washington Commanders 28-27 on Nov. 10. Outside of that, Pittsburgh has surrendered more than 20 points in just two games, with one of those instances being Thursday’s setback against Cleveland. And listen, having such a talented defense is great for the Steelers. That unit should be continuously praised for where it has this team at this point in the season. However, putting up points in bunches is still sometimes required, and do we really trust that this offense can do that when it matters most? Pittsburgh, the No. 3 seed in the AFC, would go up against the sixth-seeded Baltimore Ravens if the playoffs started today. I don’t know about you, but there is absolutely zero chance I’m taking a 35-year-old Russell Wilson, Najee Harris and George Pickens over Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and Zay Flowers if that game was to turn into an offensive showdown. Suppose the Steelers’ defense does hold down the fort, though. Then Pittsburgh is presumably off to Buffalo to face the Bills, who average the third-most points per game in the NFL (29.1).  Baltimore ranks second on that list, by the way (30.4 points per game). The Steelers are way down in 16th (22.9). Pittsburgh did do a fantastic job of containing the Ravens on Sunday, eking out an 18-16 victory. No offensive fireworks, no problems for the Steelers. If Pittsburgh does want to put together a deep run this postseason, its defense is going to have to be nearly perfect. We can’t expect Wilson to outplay some of the league’s best quarterbacks and offenses if he couldn’t even step on Cleveland’s throat after Browns signal-caller Jameis Winston threw an interception with 4:22 left in regulation on Thursday.  Up 19-18, the Steelers had a chance to put the game away right then and there, but they went three-and-out, setting the stage for a 2-yard rushing touchdown by Nick Chubb that provided Cleveland with the go-ahead points. Pittsburgh might not be the powerhouse its 8-3 record tells us it is. We’re not ready to fully deem the Steelers pretenders just yet, but they certainly could be flirting with that title soon depending on how they fare in four divisional games over the next six weeks.

Iconic venues in the Northeast or Midwest typically host these games, though. Around the holidays, it might be a tropical locale where mai tais are many. Friday’s clash between No. 12 Duke and No. 17 Arizona is unique because it will be held on campus, at the Wildcats’ McKale Center in Tucson, Ariz. “We’re still committed to really high-quality home and homes, and that won’t ever change,” Arizona president of basketball operations Matt King said. “We don’t want our season ticket holders to ever believe... that we’re not going to try to make sure there are some big-time games.” If you were around the last time Arizona hosted Duke, in February 1991, you’re old enough to place a bet (and drink a mai tai) tonight. Let’s look at the Blue Devils-Wildcats as well as action in the NHL and college football. After losing consecutive games for the first time this season, NHL points leader Winnipeg salvaged a home-and-home with the Florida Panthers on Tuesday, cruising to a 6-3 win north of the border. That game was a respite in a stretch in which the Jets play nine of 10 on the road, where they are 7-2-0 to start the season. Behind co-points leaders Mark Scheifele and Kyle Connor (24 apiece), the Jets’ attack is dynamic, home or away. Winnipeg leads the league with 80 goals and takes on a Penguins club that has yielded an NHL-worst 81 goals while struggling to maintain leads. Winnipeg won the first meeting between the clubs 6-3 in late October. The Jets are likely to start backup goalie Eric Comrie as two division games loom after this one, so expect something similar this time around. A goal from the Pens’ Sidney Crosby would add intrigue as the 600th of his superstar career.

UNLV hasn’t accomplished the feat since 1984, but at 8-4 entering this Mountain West matchup, the program is closing in. Still alive for a crack at a rematch with No. 12 Boise State in the conference championship game, the Rebels must keep winning and get outside help in the form of a Colorado State loss in either of the next two weeks. Taking care of business against the Spartans won’t be easy. San Jose State quarterback Walker Eget has passed for 841 yards in the past two games, including 446 in last week’s 42-21 loss to Boise State, connecting often with the nation’s leading receiver, Nick Nash. The rapport between Rebels quarterback Hajj-Malik Williams and wideout Ricky White III is solid, too. Williams is a dual-threat as well, rushing for eight touchdowns to go with his 14 passing TDs.

It was April 1986, to be exact. The shot these days is a staple for many offenses and frequently influences outcomes if teams aren’t careful—or versatile. Duke went just 4-for-24 from deep in a Nov. 12, neutral-court loss to then-No. 19 Kentucky but lost only by five. So, while the Blue Devils may live by the three, they don’t have to perish by it. Their spirits and percentage surged in a Nov. 16 rout of visiting Wofford. Sparked by separate 4-for-7 efforts from Tyrese Proctor and Isaiah Evans, Duke was 16 for-38 from long range and won 86-35. Arizona struggles to defend the 3, which figures to be its undoing Friday. The Wildcats have been idle since Nov. 15 at Wisconsin (jump around for another on-campus showdown!), when they allowed the Badgers to connect on 12-of-27 treys while hitting a mere 4-of-23.

Baylor stumbled through the second overtime, missing five free throws and neglecting to properly defend the 3-point line as St. John's built a lead.   But the Red Storm left the door open just a crack, and Roach barreled through it with his decisive shot, giving Baylor its fourth straight victory after an embarrassing season-opening loss to Gonzaga.   V.J. Edgecombe's 3-pointer with 6.5 seconds left Thursday brought Baylor to within two points and, after a timeout and a foul, Zuby Ejiofor of St. John's missed both free throws with 4.1 seconds to play. Norchad Omier grabbed the rebound and fed Roach for his winning shot.  ""Jeremy Roach -- a big-time play,"" Baylor coach Scott Drew said after the win. ""He makes big plays. I loved seeing him make that shot and the team celebrate. We showed a lot of heart.""  Omier led Baylor with 24 points and 10 rebounds, with Robert Wright scoring 17 points, Jalen Celestine adding 14, Jayden Nunn tallying 12 and Edgecombe contributing 10.  ""My teammates had my back,"" Roach said. ""They had my confidence in me, and I just wanted to make a play. We've just been in too many battles together, so we had to come back for that one. We all came together. We never back down.""  The Volunteers (5-0) beat Virginia 64-42 behind 26 points from Chaz Lanier, 14 from Igor Milicic Jr., and a determined defensive effort. Eighteen of Lanier's points came after halftime.  ""My teammates were finding me. Shout-out to them,"" Lanier said. ""We had a great plan defensively and really focused on that in the second half.""  Tennessee led just 22-21 at the break and was up 39-34 with 10:48 remaining. It then reeled off a 25-8 run to end the game; Virginia hit just one field goal over the final 7:44.   The Volunteers doubled the output of Virginia in the second half, outscoring the Cavaliers 42-21. Tennessee held Virginia to 28 percent shooting and forced nine turnovers that they turned into 18 points.  Tennessee also had 19 points off 18 offensive rebounds combined in both halves.  Tennessee is playing this tournament without J.P. Estrella (left foot injury) and Cameron Carr (left thumb injury), with Estrella's lack of physical improvement a spot of concern for coach Rick Barnes and the team.  ""It is concerning,"" Barnes said about Estrella. ""We know he wants to play. We know he has done everything he can do. I think the plan we had for him to start was the right plan. ... It is day-to-day, and it is the same injury that he has dealt with."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Texas rides a four-game winning streak into the final, while Saint Joseph's has been victorious in three straight contests. Their meeting will be their first since the Longhorns recorded a 68-50 victory on Nov. 24, 2008.   Saint Joseph's (4-1) overcame squandering a 16-point lead in Thursday's 78-77 victory over Texas Tech in the semifinals. Justice Ajogbor made the second of his two free throws with 13 seconds remaining to snap a tie and cap the scoring. Anthony Finkley successfully contested Darrion Williams' floater at the buzzer to preserve the win for the Hawks. ""We come in here (to Barclays Center), an amazing NBA venue in Brooklyn, and I'm like, God is good,"" Saint Joseph's coach Billy Lange said. ""Just to get these opportunities, regardless of the result ... is the thing I'm grateful for the most right now.""  Erik Reynolds II scored 26 points and went 6 of 11 from 3-point range, while Xzayvier Brown finished with 20 points following a 13-for-13 effort from the free-throw line. Brown is averaging 17.4 points and Reynolds 16.8 over the first five games of the season. Texas (4-1) advanced to Friday's championship game with a 70-66 win over Syracuse on Thursday, holding on after giving up an 11-point halftime lead. Arthur Kaluma posted 16 points, 10 rebounds and four assists to pace the Longhorns before fouling out.  ""I take more of a facilitator role when I work the middle,"" Kaluma said of his production against a zone defense. ""When I get the ball in the middle, I'm able to spray the ball to my teammates to get easier shots. But when they go man (defense), it's still that facilitation mindset even when I have more opportunities to score.""  Tre Johnson, who came in averaging 23.5 points per game, added 16 points on Thursday. Johnson went just 1 of 7 from 3-point range in what was his lowest-scoring output of Texas' first five games.  The Longhorns struggled from deep vs. Syracuse, making just 4 of 15 shots. But Texas benefited from holding the Orange to 5-of-21 shooting from long distance, and Syracuse was a dismal 9 of 18 at the free-throw line.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

In Thursday's semifinal round of the Legends Classic, both teams forged late rallies that came up a few points short, leading to their first losses of the season. Now the Orange (3-1) will face the Red Raiders (4-1) in the tournament's consolation game on Friday night in New York.  Syracuse fell in a 14-3 hole early and was down 16 early in the second half before Eddie Lampkin started the comeback with a personal 7-0 run featuring a 3-point play and a dunk. Lampkin scored 12 of his 14 points in the second half.  The Orange took a pair of one-point leads as time wound down, but they made only one field goal in the final 3:17 as Texas secured a 70-66 win at the free-throw line.  ""There's no consolation prizes,"" said Syracuse coach Adrian Autry, who bemoaned three late turnovers as well as missed rebounds. ""We had a chance to win the game, and we didn't. That's on us, that's on me.""  Lampkin added six assists and five rebounds to continue a stellar start to his Syracuse career. The former TCU and Colorado center is averaging 14.8 points, 8.3 rebounds and 4.8 assists through four games.  JJ Starling, one game removed from a 38-point performance in a double-overtime win over Youngstown State, led the Orange against Texas with 16 points. Like Syracuse in its game, Texas Tech was behind by as many as 16 points in the latter semifinal game against Saint Joseph's. The trio of JT Toppin, Darrion Williams and Chance McMillian scored 34 of the Red Raiders' 42 second-half points to fuel a comeback. McMillian's bucket and foul gave Texas Tech a 64-62 advantage at the 6:44 mark -- its first lead since 2-0. But the defense was lacking as Saint Joseph's made four shots in a row with less than four minutes left. After Toppin tied the game with 1:07 to go, he was called for an over-the-back foul on a rebound attempt, and Justice Ajogbor made 1 of 2 free throws to deliver the Hawks a 78-77 win. Toppin had 22 points and a remarkable 18 rebounds -- 12 on offense. His season averages rose to 20.8 points and 11.2 rebounds through five games. Before the Red Raiders hit the big city, Texas Tech coach Grant McCasland said there were ways Toppin could be even better. ""I think the area of improvement needs to be, how active can we continue to get him defensively where he's not just surviving a possession?"" McCasland said. ""Because he's going to play against great players in our league, but now he's been tremendous. I'll tell you what I love about JT: He really does want to know how to get better."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Instead, Pitino and his squad have a short amount of time to overcome a potentially demoralizing loss. The No. 22 Red Storm will look to produce a quick bounce-back effort Friday night when they play Virginia in the third-place game of the Baha Mar Hoops Championship in Nassau, Bahamas.   Both teams lost in opening-round action Thursday night. St. John's suffered its first loss of the season when Jeremy Roach hit a 3-pointer as time expired in the second overtime to lift No. 13 Baylor to a 99-98 win. Virginia also fell for the first time in the nightcap, when No. 11 Tennessee pulled away from the Cavaliers in the second half for a 64-42 victory. St. John's (4-1) appeared primed to pull off the upset when it scored the first seven points of the game and took a pair of 18-point leads in the first half before entering the locker room with a 44-30 lead. Baylor shot 47.1 percent (16 of 34) from the field in the second half, including 57.1 percent (8 of 14) from 3-point territory and went ahead 77-74 on Roach's 3-pointer with 1:48 left. St. John's scored the final three points of regulation and then overcame a five-point deficit in the final 1:47 of the first overtime before opening two five-point leads in the second extra session, the last at 98-93 when Deivon Smith split a pair of free throws with 18 seconds remaining. V.J. Edgecombe responded with a 3-pointer for Baylor and St. John's left the door open one more time when Zuby Ejiofor missed a pair of free throws with 4.1 seconds remaining. Norchad Omier pulled down the rebound and passed to Roach, who raced down the court and hoisted the game-winning shot just before the buzzer sounded. ""That was about as difficult a loss as you can have,"" Pitino said. Ejiofor's missed free throws served as a harsh reminder of the narrow margin between victory and defeat. St. John's shot 57.1 percent (16 of 28) from the line, matching the program's worst single-game mark since Pitino took over prior to last season. ""They're going to be disappointed -- they had the game in control at the end and (Roach) made a big shot,"" Pitino said. ""We missed the free throws, could've iced it. It could've been over, but it wasn't."" There were no such remorseful what-ifs for Virginia (3-1), which trailed only 22-21 at the half after Andrew Rohde hit a 3-pointer with five seconds left. The Cavaliers opened the second half 1 for 6 with four turnovers during the first seven minutes, a span in which Tennessee mounted a 15-3 run. Virginia got within five points at 39-34 on Taine Murray's 3-pointer with 10:48 left, but the Volunteers ended the game with a 25-8 surge.  Virginia, which has yet to score more than 70 points in a game this season, shot 28.6 percent from the field (14 of 49) and allowed Tennessee to pull down 18 offensive rebounds and score 19 second-chance points. ""When you play against high level competition, it really shows you where you are as a team,"" interim head coach Ron Sanchez said. ""We've got to put 40 minutes together.

In its fifth game, the trait also appeared on the offensive side. After opening the Charleston Classic in South Carolina with a thrilling overtime victory over Virginia Commonwealth, the Pirates (3-2) will face a quick turnaround when they meet Vanderbilt (5-0) on Friday. The Pirates will play their first opponent from a power conference after rallying from an eight-point deficit in the second half to earn a 69-66 win on Thursday. Held under 60 points in their first four games against mid-majors in the New York/New Jersey area, Seton Hall produced its best offensive showing of the season on Thursday. Leading scorer Chaunce Jenkins scored all of his season-best 22 points after halftime. Jenkins was 6 of 10 from the field in the final 25 minutes after taking just two shots due to foul trouble in the first half. He made the go-ahead basket with 2:21 remaining in overtime off an inbounds play. ""The guys fought, man,"" Seton Hall coach Shaheen Holloway said after his team earned a potential Quad 1 win by beating the Atlantic 10 preseason favorite. ""Super proud of these guys. They clawed, they scratched, they made plays when we had to make plays."" Isaiah Coleman added 12 points and 10 rebounds for the Pirates, who shot 41.8 percent from the floor. David Tubek hit all three of his 3-point tries, and Seton Hall went 7 of 12 from deep and is 15 of 30 from behind the arc in its past two games. Like VCU, Vanderbilt represents another potent offense to challenge Seton Hall's stingy defense. The Commodores averaged 91.5 points in four double-digit victories before posting a 73-71 win over Nevada on Thursday. After facing a team projected to finish third in the Mountain West Conference, Vanderbilt is seeking its first 6-0 start since beginning the 2007-08 season with 16 straight wins. ""We got a perfect record, but we're not perfect,"" Vanderbilt coach Mark Byington said this week. ""We got a lot of things to work on. Our guys know it, and I know it."" Similar to Seton Hall, the Commodores made plays down the stretch after squandering virtually all of a 12-point lead in the second half. AJ Hoggard scored 18 points for Vanderbilt, which overcame 53.7 percent shooting from the floor by Nevada. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

On Thursday afternoon in the first round at Charleston, S.C., Miami (3-1) never led while falling 80-69 to Drake. Later on Thursday, the Cowboys (3-1) squandered a 10-point lead in an 86-78 loss to Florida Atlantic. The Friday matchup will be special for Cowboys backup point guard Arturo Dean, who is from Miami. Dean played for Florida International the past two seasons, and he led the nation in steals in 2023-24 with 104. He also led the Panthers in scoring (13.4 points per game), rebounds (5.1 boards per game) and assists (4.0 per game). ""He takes tremendous pride on defense,"" Oklahoma State coach Steve Lutz said. ""You don't get 100-plus steals by accident."" Hurricanes coach Jim Larranaga believes that the Cowboys will test Miami. ""They've got some really big guys,"" he said. ""We haven't played that type of size yet (this season)."" Up front, Oklahoma State starts 6-foot-10, 245-pound Abou Ousmane and 6-7, 230-pound Robert Jennings II. Jennings amassed 14 points and 11 rebounds against Florida Atlantic, while Khalil Brantley scored a team-high 16 points. This is supposed to be a rebuilding season for the Cowboys, who were predicted to come in 14th out of 16 teams in the Big 12 based on a preseason vote of the conference's head coaches. The Cowboys have earned just one NCAA Tournament berth in the past seven years. Lutz, after coaching Western Kentucky last season, is in his first year with the Cowboys, who lost four starters from 2023-24. Miami, meanwhile, has a lot to prove after a Thursday game in which Drake logged a 14-5 edge in the offensive rebounds. The Bulldogs also posted a 36-18 advantage in paint points. Miami's defense had trouble with Drake's voluminous screens. Two Miami starters -- center Lynn Kidd and power forward Brandon Johnson -- will be looking for bounce-back games on offense. Kidd had just two points against Drake, while Johnson had seven. Nijel Pack topped the Hurricanes with 17 points, raising his team-leading scoring average to 15.3 per game.

The rest of the Huskies? Not so much. Washington (3-1) ranks last in the conference in field-goal percentage (.402), free-throw percentage (.578) and assists per game (11.3). The Huskies are 17th -- in an 18-team conference -- in scoring (70.8 ppg). First-year Washington coach Danny Sprinkle vowed to shake things up. ""Our starting lineup is going to change and it might change from half to half,"" Sprinkle said. ""It might change every game depending on who is playing with energy and giving the team something. But you have to produce if you're going to be in the game."" The Huskies outlasted UMass Lowell 74-69 on Sunday as Osobor scored 23 points and grabbed a career-high 18 rebounds. Tyree Ihenacho, Tyler Harris and Zoom Diallo each scored 12 for the Huskies, and Luis Kortright added 10. Harris, Diallo and Kortright all came off the bench. ""Minutes are going to start being distributed by production,"" Sprinkle said. ""That's the only way to separate. ... Offensively, you better be making the right basketball play. When it's your turn to knock down a shot, you better knock down a shot. When it's your turn to make a layup, you better make a layup. And that's the best way to stay on the court. ""If you're not doing those things, I got to keep that revolving door until I find some continuity to where somebody who is playing hard takes hold of that spot.""

UCLA jumped ahead of the Bengals early, leading by 17 points in the first half before settling for a 14-point edge at the break. The margin topped out at 28 points. Sebastian Mack continued a run of strong performances coming off the UCLA bench, scoring a season-high 21 points to complement Tyler Bilodeau's 20 points. ""He's really improving in his pace and his decision-making,"" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said of Mack. Cronin pointed to Mack's rise since the Bruins' loss to New Mexico on Nov. 8 when the sophomore guard scored just two points and committed three turnovers in nine minutes. Mack has scored in double digits in all three games since and has given the ball away a total of just three times. ""I've always loved his toughness,"" Cronin added of Mack. ""He's a bright spot for us."" Another Bruins guard, Dylan Andrews, returned to the lineup on Wednesday after a groin injury kept him out of blowout victories against Boston University and Lehigh. Andrews had three points and four assists in 12 minutes off the bench against Idaho State. Cal State Fullerton (1-4) makes the short trip north from Orange County, continuing an early-season nonconference gauntlet. The Titans already lost to three of UCLA's former Pac-12 Conference counterparts, Stanford, Colorado and Oregon State, as well as 2024 NCAA Tournament second-round qualifier Grand Canyon.

They made up for it by shooting 25-for-27 (92.6 percent) from the free-throw line. That was the second-highest percentage in program history in a game with at least 20 attempts. The Wildcats won an in-season tournament in the Caribbean (the Cayman Islands Classic) two seasons ago, with a semifinal overtime victory over Nevada and a 61-59 victory over LSU in the championship game.

The Wildcats began the week with a come-from-behind victory against Montana State, 72-69. Northwestern guard Brooks Barnhizer had 20 points and 10 rebounds in his first game this season since returning from a foot injury. Forward Nick Martinelli guided Northwestern's scoring attack with a game-high 22 points and seven rebounds to preserve the win. According to coach Chris Collins, Northwestern (4-1) showed resiliency. The Wildcats nearly had their second straight overtime game, but the Bobcats missed a 3-pointer at the horn. ""It was kind of the second straight game where we had a lot of game pressure on us, and the real positive is that our guys responded,"" Collins said. ""We were able to get stops when we needed them."" Collins said he was happy to have Barnhizer 100 percent healthy again, as he and Martinelli reached an early-season landmark: scoring at least 20 points in the same game. ""(Having Barnhizer back) means a lot,"" Collins said. ""He's one of the best players in the country. ... He's such a fierce competitor. His energy, how hard he plays, his physicality, his leadership and his voice -- we haven't had that. We've had it from the sideline, but it's different."" Barnhizer said he felt his confidence returning once he took the floor and regained his form on both sides of the ball. ""I missed it a lot. To be out there with the guys, being able to go to war with them, is just fun,"" Barnhizer said. ""I'm glad to be back out there.""

The decision comes more than a month after Tropicana Field's roof was torn apart when Hurricane Milton made landfall just south of Tampa on Oct. 9. The stadium also suffered heavy water damage. The city estimates the renovation will cost $55.7 million. The Rays have already made plans to play their home games next season at the New York Yankees' 11,000-seat spring training ballpark -- Steinbrenner Field -- in Tampa.

Lanier made four of his six 3-pointers and scored 18 of his 26 points in the second half, helping the Volunteers (5-0) hand the Cavaliers (3-1) their first loss under interim coach Ron Sanchez.   Tennessee will face No. 13 Baylor (4-1) in Friday's championship game and Virginia will meet No. 22 St. John's (4-1) in the consolation game.   Tennessee outscored Virginia 15-3 to start the second half, opening a 37-24 lead. Lanier scored the first 11 of those points for the Volunteers, including the 1,000th point of the North Florida transfer's career.   The Cavaliers clawed back to within 39-34 on Taine Murray's 3-pointer with 10:48 left, but Igor Milicic Jr. answered with a triple and Tennessee quickly regained control.   Milicic, who played at Virginia as a freshman and then transferred to play for Sanchez at Charlotte, finished with 14 points against his former school and coach.   An 18-0 run ballooned Tennessee's lead to 64-38 before coach Rick Barnes emptied his bench.   The Volunteers scored 30 points off 18 turnovers and turned 18 offensive rebounds into 19 second-chance points. Virginia turned Tennessee's seven turnovers into only two points.

Nearly 12 years later, the two Harbaughs will be back on the same field as NFL head coaches when the Baltimore Ravens visit the Los Angeles Chargers on Monday night. Both teams are in the playoff mix with Baltimore holding a 7-4 record and the Chargers sitting at 7-3. John Harbaugh has won both NFL matchups against his brother, including the Ravens' 34-31 win over Jim's San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl following the 2012 regular season. The other meeting was on Thanksgiving Day in 2011 when host Baltimore won a 16-6 decision. Now, the hype train is on overload as the siblings prepare to face one another again. ""It's a tough matchup,"" 62-year-old John Harbaugh said of the contest on Wednesday. ""Winning football team. Extremely well-coached football team, no doubt about it. One of the best coaches of our generation. Even if he wasn't my brother, I'd say that."" Jim Harbaugh, 60, is back in the NFL after coaching Michigan for nine seasons and winning last season's national championship. He previously spent four seasons leading the 49ers. Being part of the college ranks made the wait longer for Jim to face John, who is in his 17th season as coach of the Ravens. Those memories of being on the wrong side of the Super Bowl outcome took a while to dissipate. ""At the time, that was tough,"" Jim Harbaugh said Wednesday. ""After some time and reflection went by, it's my brother, it's my best friend. Really proud of him. Really happy for his success. It was earned."" Ravens star safety Kyle Hamilton said being part of the brotherly rivalry is a unique deal. ""From his perspective, he's done a good job managing emotions,"" Hamilton said of John Harbaugh. ""We still have a game to play, but I think everybody understands it's kind of historic and it's cool to be part of history."" Both coaches made remarks suggesting they didn't want their brotherly battle to overshadow the pivotal AFC contest. The Ravens are in second place in the AFC North, one game behind the Pittsburgh Steelers. Baltimore is 4-4 against AFC foes. The Chargers are two games behind the first-place Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC West. Los Angeles is a solid 5-2 against fellow AFC teams. Baltimore lost 18-16 to the host Steelers last week after winning seven of its previous eight games. The Chargers have won four straight games after notching a 34-27 victory over the visiting Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. Both teams employ quarterbacks having solid campaigns. Two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson of Baltimore ranks second in the NFL in passing yardage (2,876) and touchdown passes (25). He has been intercepted just three times and has rushed for 584 yards and two scores. Justin Herbert of the Chargers has been intercepted just once. He has thrown for 2,186 yards and 13 touchdowns. ""His talent, the effort that he puts in. Everything that you can say good about a quarterback and then some,"" Jim Harbaugh said regarding what he likes about Herbert. ""Talent and effort, and then intangibles that are off the charts. Any measurable you can have for a quarterback, tangible or intangible, he possesses at the elite, highest level."" Ravens star middle linebacker Roquan Smith (hamstring) missed practice on Thursday. The NFL co-leader in tackles (110) was hurt against the Steelers. Also sitting out practice for Baltimore were receiver Nelson Agholor (illness), cornerback Arthur Maulet (calf), safety Sanoussi Kane (ankle) and defensive lineman Travis Jones (ankle). Chargers rookie receiver Ladd McConkey (shoulder) sat out practice Thursday. He was injured against the Bengals. Middle linebacker Denzel Perryman (groin), cornerback Cam Hart (concussion/ankle) and safety AJ Finley (ankle) also sat out practice. The Ravens have won the teams' past four regular-season meetings, but the host Chargers recorded a 23-17 wild-card victory over Baltimore following the 2018 regular season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Goaltender Dustin Wolf made 27 saves, and MacKenzie Weegar collected three assists. Alexis Lafreniere and Will Cuylle replied for the Rangers, who had their three-game winning streak end. Igor Shesterkin tied his career high with 46 saves in an outstanding performance amid an impressive goalie battle. The Flames set a season high with 49 shots on goal. Their previous high was 37. With the score even and overtime looming on the horizon, Zary put the Flames ahead at 10:35 of the third period with a great effort. The second-year player held off a check while he lifted a short-side top-corner shot from in tight for his fourth goal of the season. Jonathan Huberdeau collected his 500th career assist on the play. The Rangers had a frantic late push to for an equalizer with the goalie pulled for an attacker, but they could not beat Wolf a third time. The Flames opened with one of their best periods of the season and were rewarded when Coronato opened the scoring at 7:26. Upon receiving the puck, Coronato worked to near the faceoff dot and ripped a low shot through the screen and into the net for his sixth goal of the season.

The Steelers went for two but came up empty.   However, Pittsburgh stayed in control, as Donte Jackson picked off a pass from Cleveland quarterback Jameis Winston just moments later. Wilson and the Steelers went three-and-out, though, leading to the Browns' game-winning points.   A Hail Mary into the end zone from Wilson fell incomplete on the final play of the contest.   Winston completed 18 of 27 passes for 219 yards and the interception. He also scrambled for a 2-yard score and completed a two-point conversion pass with 12:16 left in the fourth quarter to give Cleveland (3-8) an 18-6 lead. Chubb collected 59 yards on 20 touches.

Two plays later, Winston was sacked from behind, with the ball coming free and Pittsburgh recovering it. The Steelers made the most of the turnover thanks to Wilson's connection with Austin.

Mrazek stopped 32 of 33 shots for his sixth win in 14 games this season. The veteran goalie was particularly sharp in the third period, twice stopping Sam Reinhart on prime scoring chances. Since completing a seven-game winning streak, the Panthers are 1-4-0 in their last five games. Reinhart's 15th goal of the season was Florida's only tally of the game, despite a 33-20 shots advantage. It was the third time in Chicago's last four games that the Blackhawks had recorded 20 or fewer shots on net. Florida goaltender Spencer Knight stopped 17 of 19 shots. The Blackhawks had been 0-for-6 on power plays in their previous four games, but Teravainen ended the slump 2:46 into the first period. An interference penalty on Niko Mikkola gave Chicago an early chance with the extra attacker, and Teravainen buried a rebound for his fifth goal of the season. Smith also tallied his fifth goal to extend Chicago's lead at 10:07 of the second period. Patrick Maroon's canny pass found Smith alone heading toward the Florida net, and Smith deposited a backhanded shot. Just 34 seconds after Smith's goal, Reinhart answered with a shot from the circle that beat a screened Mrazek. Reinhart has 18 points (10 goals, eight assists) over a 12-game points streak, tied for the fifth-longest streak in Panthers franchise history. Besides the efforts of Mrazek and the Blackhawks' defense, the Panthers' offense had some self-inflicted issues in the form of turnovers and missed passes.

The first-year coach of the Cardinals (2-1) guided the Eagles' basketball program for nine years, winning four regular-season Big South titles and three conference tournament championships before leaving for the College of Charleston in 2021.  Current Eagles coach Mark Prosser succeeded Kelsey and previously served as an assistant under Kelsey for six seasons. Prosser is the son of the late Skip Prosser, who coached Kelsey at Xavier and later gave his former player his first college coaching job there. Kelsey has long cited the elder Prosser as a mentor. ""The admiration that my father had for him ... I'd hear about it often,"" Mark Prosser told the Louisville Courier-Journal. Kelton Talford played on Kelsey's last Winthrop team. The senior forward leads the Eagles (4-2) with a 7.2 rebounding average and ranks second in scoring at 15 points per game. He posted season highs of 22 points and 10 rebounds in Winthrop's 77-75 home win Sunday over North Carolina Central. The win was Winthrop's third straight game decided by one or two points. The Eagles are 2-1 in that stretch. Louisville is coming off a 100-68 victory over Bellarmine on Tuesday. Terrence Edwards Jr. and Kasean Pryor led the Cardinals, scoring 26 and 21 points, respectively. The Cardinals hit 54.7 percent (35 for 64) from the field and made 12 of 35 3-point attempts. The 34.3 percent performance from beyond the arc was the best for Kelsey's team this season. Perimeter shooting is a key facet of Kelsey's offense, and the Cardinals rank near the top nationally in 3-point shots, but close to the bottom in 3-point accuracy. That's not a major issue for Kelsey. Aside from taking a few too many difficult shots in the loss against Tennessee, he hasn't had a problem with his players' shot selection. ""We say we want to hunt great, hunt great, hunt great,"" he said after the Bellarmine win. ""That's hunting great shots, and if we generate great and it doesn't go in, I sleep like a baby.

Binnington tied Mike Luit atop the Blues' all-time victories list among goalies. Jordan Kyrou and Nathan Walker scored in regulation for the Blues, who won for just the second time in their past eight games (2-5-1). Jake Neighbours provided the lone goal for either team in the shootout. Alexander Wennberg scored twice for the Sharks, who have won just one of their last six games (1-2-3). Mikael Granlund and Macklin Celebrini assisted on both tallies. Yaroslav Askarov made 29 saves in his third NHL start and first for the Sharks. With Askarov pulled for an extra attacker, Wennberg scored from the right faceoff dot with nine seconds left to force overtime. The Blues scored 11 seconds in the game with their fourth forward line. Askarov tried to clear the puck along the boards, but Radek Faska intercepted his pass in the left corner and set up Walker's point-blank goal in front of the net. San Jose tied the game 1-1 at 8:23 of the opening period with a power-play goal. Wennberg snapped a shot into the upper left corner of the net from a tough right-side angle. St. Louis finished the first period with a 15-7 shots advantage. The Blues earned two good scoring chances late in the period, but Askarov stopped Robert Thomas stepping out from behind the net and Kyrou on his shot from the slot. Early in the second period, Klim Kostin broke in on Binnington from the left wing on a two-on-one break and pushed the puck through him. However, the puck trickled wide and the game remained tied.

Vanderbilt controlled most of the second half, but Nevada made a late charge to cut a 12-point deficit to three on Love's fastbreak layup with 2:37 left.  The Wolf Pack picked up a steal out of a timeout on the Commodores' next possession, leading to Tre Coleman's field goal.  Hoggard drove the right side and banked in a contested layup with 1:14 left to extend the lead to four.

UNLV (8-2, 4-1 Mountain West) rejoined the College Football Playoff poll on Tuesday and is closing in on its first 10-win season since quarterback Randall Cunningham led the program to its since-vacated 11-2 finish in 1984. The Rebels need Colorado State to lose one of its final two games against Fresno State or Utah State in order to reach their second straight conference title game and, more importantly, set up a rematch with No. 12 Boise State. UNLV fell to the Broncos 44-20 in last year's championship. San Jose State, however, is in a good position to play spoiler themselves. The Spartans (6-4, 3-3) entered last season's game against UNLV as a slight underdog and ended up winning 37-31. San Jose State is coming off last Saturday's home game against Boise State in which it was driving to take a 21-0 lead before the Broncos forced a turnover on downs at the goal line. That kept it a two-possession game, and Boise State quickly woke up from there and ran away with a 42-21 win. ""We were in that game,"" Spartans coach Ken Niumatalolo said. ""I'm encouraged because we're doing a lot of good things. I feel like we stopped ourselves a lot on offense. We looked at a lot of things to improve on."" San Jose State quarterback Walker Eget has led the nation in passing yards in consecutive weeks, eclipsing his career high in both games. His 446 yards through the air against Boise State was the most in a game for a Mountain West quarterback this season. Eget replaced Emmett Brown as the starter in October. The Spartans have the nation's top receiver this season, as redshirt senior Nick Nash leads the country in both receptions (95) and receiving yards (1,282). San Jose State also has the Mountain West's second-leading receiver behind Nash in Justin Lockhart, who has 925 yards on 48 receptions. ""They've got an elite group of receivers,"" UNLV coach Barry Odom said. ""Their quarterback's playing really well. Schematically, they caused some issues on their alignments with space. We've got to do a great job. We talk all the time in our defensive meetings about eliminating explosive plays. They are going to get some, we've got to minimize those."" UNLV is certainly not lacking in the wide receiver department either, as All-American Ricky White III ranks third in the Mountain West with 867 receiving yards and second with 63 receptions. His performance improved mightily following UNLV's first three games of the season, coinciding with their quarterback switch to Hajj-Malik Williams. Williams has impressed in his seven games as the starter as well. He leads the team with 646 rushing yards and eight scores on the ground to go along with 1,436 yards, 14 touchdowns and three interceptions through the air. Mountain West preseason Defensive Player of the Year Jackson Woodard has perhaps been the Rebels' MVP this season. The linebacker's 99 total tackles, four interceptions and 3.5 sacks have him on the watchlist for the Nagurski, Bednarik and Butkus awards. Woodard is also among the national finalists for the Burlsworth award, given to the top player in college football who began their career as a walk-on. Woodard initially played under Odom at Arkansas, Brandon Burlsworth's alma mater. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Barnes scored six straight points to give Toronto a six-point lead with 3:24 to play. Barrett's dunk with 2:33 to play bumped the lead to nine. Edwards cut the deficit to five by sinking a 3-pointer with 1:46 to go, but he missed a 3-point attempt that would have trimmed the gap to one with 18 seconds left.

At the time, the team labeled the injury a hyperextended left knee. George missed the 76ers' first five games of the season while nursing a similar injury suffered during the preseason.

Werenski, who scored when the teams combined for six goals in the second and had three assists, sent an open wrister past Lightning netminder Jonas Johansson (36 saves) in the early stages of overtime to help Columbus overcome a 3-0 hole and win for the third time in four games. Sean Monahan had a goal with three assists and Kent Johnson scored twice in his return from missing 14 games due to a shoulder issue for the Blue Jackets.   Nikita Kucherov had three assists for the Lightning, who struggled defensively after allowing three goals combined in winning the previous three games.   On the power play just 1:51 into the game, Kucherov got the rebound from Jake Guentzel's shot and sent the puck for Brayden Point to drill past Columbus' Elvis Merzlikins (24 saves) to open the scoring. A little more than two minutes later, Kucherov sent another rebound that Brandon Hagel buried.  The Lightning made it 3-0 with 8:08 remaining in the first. Victor Hedman's shot was deflected in by ex-Blue Jacket Cam Atkinson, who scored his first of the season.  Columbus finally answered with 6:25 left in the first. Damon Severson's shot went wide of the net but caromed off the friendly end board for Monahan to convert.  Columbus got within 3-2 just 28 seconds into the second via Dmitri Voronkov's breakaway goal. Then Johnson notched a power-play goal from the circle to tie it at 1:55 into the period.   Tampa Bay regained the lead 16 seconds later when Mitchell Chaffee batted in the rebound of Conor Geekie's shot. But, a little more than 1:30 later, Columbus made it 4-4 on Werenski's wrister. Columbus took the lead via Yegor Chinakhov's breakaway score at 5:26 of the period.  Tampa Bay, though, tied it when Anthony Cirelli scored on the transition with 12:52 left in the second.  Columbus went ahead on Johnson's short-hander with 8:21 left in regulation. But, the Lightning answered again, while still on the same man advantage, Geekie redirected Gage Goncalves' shot into the top right corner.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Offensive-minded defenseman Cale Makar skated around the upper edge of the left circle before unleashing a shot that was deflected home by Wood at 3:29 of the third period. The goal was Wood's second of the season. The Thursday loss wasn't the only bad news for the Capitals, who announced prior to the game that superstar captain Alex Ovechkin is expected to miss four to six weeks due to a fracture to his left fibula. The three-time Hart Trophy recipient (MVP) sustained the injury during Washington's 6-2 victory over the Utah Hockey Club on Monday. Colorado's Mikko Rantanen scored on a power play in the second period, his team-leading 13th goal of the season and ninth in his last eight games. Alexandar Georgiev made 30 saves in his return from a two-game absence caused by to an upper-body injury. That proved to be enough for the Avalanche to record their fifth win in six games and avenge a 5-2 setback to the Capitals on Nov. 15 in Denver. Washington's Pierre-Luc Dubois scored a goal in the first period. Logan Thompson turned aside 25 shots to fall to 8-1-1 in his first season with the Capitals. Tom Wilson's hard pass from just above the goal line found the trailing Dubois in front of the net for an easy conversion to open the scoring. The goal with 2:56 remaining in the first period was just Dubois' second of the season. Thompson flashed his glove to thwart Makar from point-blank range to preserve Washington's 1-0 lead midway into the second period. Rantanen's attempted backhand cross-crease pass to Nathan MacKinnon caromed off the skate of Washington defenseman Matt Roy and into the net to forge a 1-1 tie with 5:41 remaining in the second period. Connor McMichael, who scored two goals in the previous meeting against Colorado, was denied in his bid on a breakaway to snap the tie just over two minutes later. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Jack Eichel, Brett Howden and Pavel Dorofeyev scored goals and Ivan Barbashev had two assists for Vegas, which snapped a two-game losing streak. The Golden Knights improved to 12-1-1 all-time against the Senators with the victory, including 6-0-1 in Ottawa. Cassidy, an Ottawa native, became the eighth active coach in the NHL to hit the 400-win mark. Adam Gaudette and Drake Batherson scored goals and Linus Ullmark finished with 29 saves for Ottawa, which lost its fourth straight game. Vegas, coming off its first shutout loss since Jan. 10, 2024 on Wednesday at Toronto, took a 1-0 lead at the 6:45 mark of the first period on Eichel's sixth goal of the season. Barbashev set up the score with a pass from below the left goal line to a wide-open Eichel, who shoveled it into the net from the low slot. Howden made it 2-0 midway through the second period with a wrist shot off a Barbashev drop pass from the middle of the left circle that squeaked past Ullmark's blocker side for his eighth goal, one off his career high. Samsonov was called for a holding penalty when he grabbed Claude Giroux skating past the net, and Ottawa took advantage at the 7:17 mark of the third period. Gaudette cut it to 2-1 with a power-play goal when he roofed Ridly Greig's no-look backhand pass through the crease, Gaudette's eighth marker of the year. Vegas extended the lead to 3-1 two minutes later when Dorofeyev took a crossing pass from William Karlsson and snapped in a wrist shot past Ullmark's blocker side for his team-leading 10th goal. Batherson then put in a rebound of a Jake Sanderson shot to bring Ottawa within 3-2 with 7:22 remaining. The Senators, who outshot the Golden Knights 18-5 in the final period, pulled Ullmark for an extra attacker with 1:40 to go but managed only one shot on goal by Giroux that Samsonov easily gloved. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Jack Hughes added three assists and goalie Jacob Markstrom made 20 saves as he earned the win in his 500th career game.  Jack Roslovic scored the game's first goal and Andrei Svechnikov tied the score early in the third for the Hurricanes, who had their three-game winning streak snapped.

Dmitry Orlov's shot bounced off a player in front of Markstrom, who had four players surrounding him, before Roslovic poked home the rebound The teams traded turnovers before Bratt scored just under six minutes later. Hughes' pass deep in the Carolina zone was picked off by Roslovic, but Roslovic's backhanded dish was intercepted by Ondrej Palat. The left winger passed to Hughes, who was stationed to the left of Martin, before Hughes fed Bratt for a point-blank power-play goal with 5:15 left. Another nifty pass into the crease by Hughes set up Noesen's goal 46 seconds into the middle period, when Noesen capped a five-on-three sequence by flicking a shot over Martin's glove. Bratt notched the secondary assist. The Hurricanes tied the score just 12 seconds into the third on a power play. Martin Necas' pass from the edge of the Carolina zone glanced off the back boards and to Svechnikov, whose shot from the bottom of the left faceoff circle sailed over Markstrom's glove shoulder.

Korpisalo made nine saves in the middle frame and also helped the Bruins withstand a late flurry from the visitors. The Bruins finished 1-for-7 on the power play -- converting for the second consecutive game after going without a goal in the previous six in a row -- and 4-for-4 killing penalties. Boston was on its second three-game losing streak of the season (0-2-1) when Jim Montgomery was fired on Tuesday. Karel Vejmelka stopped 30 shots for Utah, which has lost four of its last five games and was shut out for the fifth time in 19 games. After being held under 20 shots in two of their previous five games, the Bruins poured that total on Vejmelka -- aided by four power plays -- in the first half of the Thursday game. Lindholm broke the game's deadlock and a personal 17-game goal drought on a power play at the 12:41 mark of the second. The first-year Bruin grabbed Brad Marchand's pass that bounced off his skate on the doorstep and buried it for his first tally since Oct. 12. The Bruins killed off a Cole Koepke slashing minor in the final seven minutes of regulation, with a Nick Schmaltz drive being blocked just wide of goal. Shortly after the advantage, Korpisalo padded away a Michael Kesselring shot from the left point. A Pastrnak empty-net goal was taken off the board due to a high-sticking call with 1:01 left. In the first period, Vejmelka made several strong saves to maintain the scoreless game as Boston racked up a 15-5 edge in shots. Boston's Mark Kastelic and Utah's Robert Bortuzzo provided early energy as well, dropping the gloves 6:17 into the game for their first of two head-to-head fights.

Simon Holmstrom scored the Islanders' goal. Ilya Sorokin made 29 saves for New York, which finished 1-2-2 on its five-game road trip. The Red Wings had an 11-9 advantage in shots on goal during the first period but the Islanders emerged with a 1-0 lead. After the Red Wings squandered an early power-play opportunity, the Islanders scored less than six minutes into the contest. Scott Mayfield took a shot from the right point that Holmstrom redirected from the slot past Lyon. It was Holmstrom's third goal this season. Sorokin made a nifty pad save against Alex DeBrincat midway through the period. The Islanders came into the game ranked 31st on the penalty kill but the Red Wings came up empty twice more in the second period. Alexander Romanov, playing in his 300th career game, was whistled for a delay of game infraction and Pierre Engvall committed a slashing penalty. During Detroit's third power play of the contest, its second-ranked power-play unit had trouble just keeping the puck in New York's zone. The Islanders had their first power-play opportunity early in the third when Christian Fischer was penalized for tripping. They were unable to produce a quality chance during that span. Detroit finally broke through with 4:46 remaining as Berggren skated into the Islanders' zone on a 2-on-1 situation and fired the puck past Sorokin. Berggren's goal beat Sorokin on the stick side and was his third of the season. J.T. Compher picked up an assist.

The Clippers and Kings both are 0-1 in West Group A play. Long removed from a dreadful 0-4 start in their $2 billion building that James Harden suspected might be ""cursed,"" the Clippers now have their home in order and old scourges vexed. The most recent guest to depart in defeat was the Orlando Magic, as Los Angeles earned a 104-93 victory on Wednesday without leading scorer Norman Powell, who was down with hamstring discomfort and will also miss Friday's game. Without Powell's 23.3 points per game, the Clippers still were able to end the Magic's six-game winning streak and become the first team to score more than 100 points against Orlando in two weeks. ""Norm has meant a lot to us; he's been playing outstanding for us,"" said the Clippers' Amir Coffey, who stepped up with 18 points, his second-highest total of the season. ""Since the start of the season I feel like he's stepped into a big role and he's been great. Just had to make some adjustments without him."" If there was a point of contention, it was the team's 25 turnovers that the Magic turned into 25 points. Harden scored 24 points but had five turnovers, as did fellow starter Kris Dunn. ""We knew it was gonna be nasty, but 25 turnovers just makes no sense,"" Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue said of playing against the Magic's rugged defense. ""We've gotta be better all around the board in just taking care of the basketball."" The Kings enter off a 109-108 loss to the Atlanta Hawks at home Monday when Keon Ellis scored a career-high 33 while making nine 3-pointers in 15 attempts. De'Aaron Fox scored 28 points, while the Kings were without DeMar DeRozan and Domantas Sabonis because of back injuries. Malik Monk (ankle) also was out. ""(My teammates) just kept saying, ‘Let it fly,'"" Ellis said, according to the Sacramento Bee. ""Same with the coaches. Everyone kept saying keep shooting it. I think everyone kind of knew I was on fire."" Sacramento is 3-4 going back to Nov. 8 in a stretch that began with a 107-98 home loss to the Clippers. It is one of just two times the Kings failed to score 100 points in a game this season. Fox leads Sacramento with 28.8 points per game, while Sabonis (20.2 points) leads in rebounds (12.5) and assists (6.6). The veteran DeRozan is scoring 22.9 points in his first season with the Kings. Sabonis and DeRozan were full participants in practice Wednesday and Thursday and are expected to return against the Clippers. Monk is expected to miss his sixth consecutive game.

Kaluma scored 16 points and grabbed 10 rebounds before fouling out with 10.8 seconds left. Johnson also had 16 points, scoring eight in the final four minutes. He sealed the outcome by draining two foul shots with 9.3 seconds remaining. Johnson's performance at the stripe was something the Orange (3-1) couldn't duplicate. They erased a 16-point deficit in the second half to take a couple of brief leads down the stretch but ultimately did themselves in with poor work at the free-throw line, where they finished 9 of 18. Chendall Weaver contributed 10 points and nine rebounds for the Longhorns (4-1), which advanced to the Friday night championship game to face the winner of the second Thursday game, Texas Tech or St. Joseph's. Syracuse will play the loser for third place. J.J. Starling scored 16 points for the Orange, who made only 5 of 21 3-point attempts (23.8 percent). Eddie Lampkin added 14 points and six assists, and Chris Bell and Jyare Davis each tallied 11 points. The first half was all Texas, all the time. The Longhorns feasted on a Syracuse defense that has struggled to stop opponents off the dribble and were able to shut down Starling, who was coming off producing a career-high 38 points in Syracuse's 104-95 double overtime win Saturday against Youngstown State. The Orange didn't score for more than four minutes, until Starling drained a 3-pointer to end a game-opening 9-0 spurt. Texas upped the margin to 14-3 when Tramon Mark hit a 3-pointer. The margin stayed in double figures for most of the half's remainder and peaked at 16 before Syracuse was able to make a late push.

They'll give it yet another go when they visit the Anaheim Ducks on Friday. Buffalo is 0-3-0 in its three previous attempts to post a winning record this season. The Sabres pulled themselves back to even Wednesday with a 1-0 win against the Los Angeles Kings, a contest that was scoreless after two periods before Jason Zucker's power-play goal 38 seconds into the third. That improved them to 5-2-0 in their past seven games after a three-game losing streak. ""That's part of the growth,"" coach Lindy Ruff said. ""You've got to get comfortable in a game like that where it's tight. ... I thought our compete on the puck was where it needed to be to win a hockey game and their compete was high, too. It was a hard game from start to finish for both teams."" Goaltender Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen returned against Los Angeles after missing two games with a lower-body injury to earn his sixth career NHL shutout. The 25-year-old is 4-0-0 in five starts since Nov. 5 and allowed just four goals in those wins. ""His size, but then his ability to get post to post, flexibility, and make those big saves ... That really energizes a group,"" forward Beck Malenstyn told the Buffalo News. ""I think he makes a lot of those timely saves for us, and we have all the trust in the world in him back there."" After a woeful 0-for-22 run on the power play to start the season, the Sabres have turned the corner with the man advantage. Since Zucker broke the drought on Oct. 26, Buffalo is 11-for-37, a 29.7 percent efficiency that ranked third in the NHL in that span entering Thursday's schedule. The Ducks have hit a groove of their own of late, riding a three-game winning streak and winners of four of their past five after a four-game skid. They followed up a 6-4 win against the Detroit Red Wings on Nov. 15 with a 4-2 victory against the Dallas Stars on Nov. 18 and a 3-2 win against the Chicago Blackhawks the next night. ""Our team's kind of starting to jell, we're starting to get some chemistry within the lines,"" forward Alex Killorn said. ""We're not scoring a ton of goals but we're not allowing a ton to go in. Our defensive play's been great."" Anaheim has allowed an average of 2.6 goals against over its past five games, giving up more than three goals only once. Lukas Dostal and John Gibson have alternated starts in goal over that stretch. Second-year forward Leo Carlsson, 19, shares the team lead with Troy Terry with six goals and is second only to Terry in points with 10, by way of two fewer assists. ""I think we're on a path where we can take another step forward soon, hopefully,"" Carlsson told Hockey Sverige.

Bryson Tucker had 14 points off the bench for the Hoosiers (4-0), while Mackenzie Mgbako, Malik Reneau and Oumar Ballo all finished with nine points. Ballo grabbed 11 rebounds and Reneau snagged 10.   Indiana had to rely on defense as it had numerous rough patches on the offensive end.   Ronald Polite III's 17 points and Donovan Atwell's 10 points paced UNCG (2-2), which shot 31.7 percent from the floor. Kenyon Giles finished 3-for-17 from the field and Atwell was 3-for-15, including 3-for-12 on 3-pointers.   The Spartans connected on nine 3-point shots but had only 11 baskets from 2-point territory. They couldn't sustain enough offense to make a charge in the final 10:52 after the Hoosiers used a 9-0 run to extend their lead to 54-42.   Indiana made 14 of 16 free throws, while UNCG hit 9 of 15 from the line.  The visitors pulled even at 40-40 by beginning the second half on a 13-4 run, capped by Malik Henry's three-point play. Tucker countered with a three-point play and another jumper for the Hoosiers, who led the rest of the way.   Tucker added another jumper during Indiana's nine-point surge after Akrum Ahemed's layup had drawn the Spartans within 45-42.   The Hoosiers, who have played only home games so far, built a 21-5 lead less than nine minutes into the contest. They went scoreless over the next five-plus minutes but did not let UNCG creep closer than seven points.   Indiana went on to lead 36-27 at halftime despite not hitting a shot in the final 2:36 of the period. Rice posted 14 points by halftime.  UNCG starters had only 17 points in the first half as the Spartans were held to 31.3 percent shooting from the field. UNCG trailed 17-3 at the 13:42 mark, with their only points coming on Giles' 3-pointer 2:28 into the game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

A spokesperson for TGL, which debuts Jan. 7 at the SoFi Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla, told Front Office Sports that discussions between the league and LPGA have already occurred, though any collaboration would only happen sometime after the league's inaugural season. LPGA commissioner Mollie Marcoux Samaan said on Wednesday at the CME Group Tour Championship in Naples, Fla., that the tour had been exploring ways to boost its marketing of LPGA players, including ""exploring some synergies with TGL."" ""We've been talking to them for a while,"" Marcoux Samaan said. ""It will be great to get our athletes in different positions. You know, with different exposure, different innovation in golf. The LPGA should be in every conversation about golf. So we've been talking to those guys for a long time, and I think we'll try to figure something out -- how we can work together, whatever that looks like."" Per the report, TGL may create a separate women's league down the line or have a mixed event involving players from both the PGA and LPGA. TGL will combine simulator golf with an actual short game area via its hybrid virtual format, so instead of teeing off at different locations, TGL mixed events would allow all golfers to tee off from the same spot -- improving the viewing experience for fans. Mixed events have become more popular of late, including McIlroy defeating Max Homa and LPGA pros Rose Zhang and Lexi Thompson in the made-for-TV golf series ""The Match."" That event, held in February, was the first version of the series to include female golfers. The $2.4 million won by McIlroy went to charity. In December, Zhang and World No. 1 Nelly Korda will be among the LPGA starts participating in the second year of the Grant Thornton Invitational, along with PGA Tour and TGL members Sahith Theegala and Rickie Fowler. The invitational is a co-sanctioned PGA Tour/LPGA Tour event established last year. There may also be a 36-hole mixed-team golf tournament at the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, with a proposal awaiting response from the International Olympic Committee. Also, Solheim Cup U.S. team captain Stacy Lewis said in September that she would like to see the biennial Presidents Cup become a mixed event. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Authorities are looking into whether Miller bet on his own games while at Temple. Miller transferred to Virginia Tech in the offseason, but on Oct. 23 the program dismissed him ""due to circumstances prior to his enrollment at Virginia Tech."" ESPN reported that the reason for Miller's dismissal was both a federal investigation and an NCAA inquiry into point-shaving. The NCAA did not comment to ESPN, and the FBI did not confirm or deny that an investigation was taking place. A regular-season game between Temple and UAB on March 7 was flagged by U.S. Integrity, a gambling watchdog firm, for unusual wagering activity. UAB began the day a 1.5- or 2-point favorite at sportsbooks but the spread ballooned to -8 by mid-afternoon, causing some books to halt betting on the game. Miller had eight points on 3-of-9 shooting and three turnovers in that game, which UAB ran away with, 100-72. The next day, Temple acknowledged in a statement that it was reviewing the reports of unusual betting. Per ESPN, the NCAA has been investigating Temple and Miller for ""several months,"" and bookmakers uncovered that some customers who had bet against Temple on March 7 also had done so throughout the season, often betting on both the game result and the total points scored in the first half. ""Hysier Miller has overcome more adversity in his 22 years than most people face in their lifetime. He will meet and overcome whatever obstacles lay ahead,"" Miller's attorney, Jason P. Bologna, told ESPN. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

In a game with 14 lead changes and nine ties where both teams struggled to score, Jenkins was the best player on the floor after dealing with foul trouble in the first half. The Old Dominion transfer made 6 of 12 shots despite going 0-for-2 before halftime. He snapped a 63-63 tie with a fadeaway over Phillip Russell from the left side off an inbounds play with 2:21 left. After VCU's Max Shulga split two free throws with 2:08 left, David Tubek sank a 3 from the right side over Jack Clark for a 68-64 lead with 35 seconds left before the Pirates sweated out the final seconds. Shulga hit a jumper with 13 seconds left to make it a two-point game and Jenkins split two at the line with 10 seconds left. The game ended when Joe Bamisile missed a 3 from the right side with five seconds left as Jenkins went over to contest. Jenkins also helped the Pirates (3-2) overcome an eight-point deficit in the final 11 minutes of regulation and hit a layup for a 61-59 lead with 15 seconds left but Shulga went by a double-team for a tying layup with two seconds left. Isaiah Coleman added 12 points and 10 rebounds for the Pirates, who shot 41.8 percent and will face Vanderbilt or Nevada on Friday. Tubek hit all three of his 3-point tries to finish with nine points as the Pirates went 7-of-12 from deep. Shulga scored 20 points to lead VCU (4-1), which will face the loser between Nevada and Vanderbilt. Zeb Jackson added 15 in his season debut after recovering from a broken hand, and Bamisile contributed 13 as the Rams shot 36.7 percent overall and 9-of-37 from 3-point range. Coleman's cutting layup with 6:10 left forged a 50-50 deadlock and Tubek hit a 3 from the left side for a 53-52 lead with 5:20 to go.

Nikola Jokic, a three-time MVP, missed the Nuggets' recent three-game road trip due to personal reasons. He is listed as questionable for Friday's game, but the Mavericks will definitely be without Luka Doncic, who suffered a right wrist injury Tuesday night and will miss at least a week. It's a blow for Dallas entering what is essentially an elimination game in the NBA Cup group stage. The Mavericks and the Nuggets have one loss each in the West Group C standings, and the loser Friday night will not advance to the knockout round. Doncic has missed time this season with a bothersome knee and will now sit for at least four games, per ESPN. ""Injuries are a part of sport and unfortunately he's had a couple of here early,"" Dallas coach Jason Kidd said. ""Hopefully that means he won't have any going forward. After this last one, hopefully he's clean for the rest of the way."" The Mavericks still have Kyrie Irving in the backcourt, and he almost beat Denver on his own nearly two weeks ago. He scored a season-high 43 points but missed the potential game-winning 3-pointer in the final seconds as the Mavericks fell 122-120. Dallas was without P.J. Washington and Dereck Lively II in that loss on Nov. 10, but both players have returned. The Mavericks have to overcome Doncic's absence to win their fourth straight game. ""Next man up. Just be ready to guard the best man or just have the best man guard you,"" center Daniel Gafford said. ""It's going to be a lot on (Irving). It's going to be a lot on Klay (Thompson). but I feel like we've done a pretty good job whenever Luka has been off the floor. ... The strategy is still the same."" The Nuggets lost their first two road games with Jokic sidelined but beat Memphis 122-110 on Tuesday night for its first group stage win. Russell Westbrook notched his NBA-record 200th career triple-double in the win over the Grizzlies, but Denver lost forward Vlatko Cancar to a left knee injury. ""Not necessarily (season-ending). It could go a couple different ways,"" coach Michael Malone said on Cancar's injury after Thursday's practice. ""We're still gathering information, letting the knee calm down a little bit. So I don't want to get doom and gloom. But he's out for the foreseeable future."" Losing Cancar, who missed last season with an ACL tear, is another blow to the team's depth. The Nuggets are already without Aaron Gordon (calf) and possibly Jokic, who is averaging a triple-double.  Malone has shown he is not shy about going deep into his bench. Guard Trey Alexander played nine minutes against Memphis on Tuesday and may get a chance to play more. Dario Saric has rejoined the rotation after not playing for five straight games. Saric started for Jokic in the three road games and had 10 points and 10 rebounds in Denver's 105-90 loss to the Grizzlies on Sunday night. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Houston enters Thursday third in defensive rating at 104.8 points allowed per 100 possessions following Wednesday's 130-113 home victory over the Indiana Pacers.  The Rockets aim to clamp down even tighter when they continue their three-game homestand on Friday against the Portland Trail Blazers in the second NBA Cup game for both. Houston and Portland are 1-0 in Western Conference Group A action. Baked into the Rockets' defensive might is their ability to force turnovers which, combined with their penchant for grabbing offensive rebounds, continues to atone for an inefficient offense. Houston has also cultivated a reputation for scoring in transition, and most of everything behind the Rockets' early-season success was on display against the Pacers.  Houston turned 23 Pacers turnovers into 30 points and recorded 23 fastbreak points. The Rockets are fourth in the league in points off turnovers at 20.6 per game, and their 18.1 fastbreak points per game rank behind only the Toronto Raptors and Denver Nuggets. Toronto is the only team scoring more second-chance points than Houston, which is tallying 18.1 per game. The Rockets had a modest 16 second-chance points off 13 offensive rebounds against the Pacers, but they also finished with a plus-19 margin in field goal attempts. The penchant to crash the offensive boards and force opponents into miscues has served Houston well through 16 games, with designs for more of the same as the season unfolds. ""That's offensive rebounds and turnovers from us,"" Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. ""We obviously take a look at those things first. Not just 23 turnovers, 16 of those were steals so our activity was great, which leads to live-ball turnovers so we can get out and run. That's where we came up with those 23 fastbreak points."" Alperen Sengun led Houston with a season-high 31 points and 12 rebounds in Wednesday's win. The fourth-year center is second on the team in scoring (18.4 points per game) and leads the Rockets in rebounding (11.1 per game). On Wednesday, the Trail Blazers' 109-99 road loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder snapped their three-game winning streak. Portland was without two of its top four scorers in Anfernee Simons (chest) and Deandre Ayton (finger), facilitating the need for others to help fill the offensive void. Second-year forward Toumani Camara responded by pairing 14 points with nine rebounds. Camara's 11 shot attempts were one off his season-high, and his points and rebounds matched his second-highest totals this season. Camara ranks just ninth on the Trail Blazers with 9.1 points per game, but he has proven capable of handling a greater workload when called upon. ""The thing about Tou is there are going to be some nights where he gets four shots and there are going to be some nights where he gets 11. It just happens that way,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said. ""He's going to have some of these nights where he's scoring more than normal. He's certainly capable to do that.  ""Tou knows who Tou is. He's not going to run around out there taking all kinds of crazy shots because they're just there. He knows who he is, and that's what's so special about him."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Underwood committed to LSU in early January but the Wolverines remained in contact with the Belleville, Mich. native. Less than two weeks before the start of the early signing period, he made it official that he's headed to Ann Arbor during a social media video. Speculation that Underwood might flip from LSU to Michigan picked up after four-star quarterback Carter Smith decommitted from the Wolverines in late October. When Underwood announced his original commitment to LSU on Jan. 6 in the Belleville High cafeteria, Michigan was one of the three finalists along with Alabama. The 6-foot-4 Underwood won two state titles at Belleville, which is located approximately 20 miles east from Ann Arbor. He fell short in both his junior and senior seasons. Underwood's high school career ended last Friday night when Belleville lost 35-21 to Novi Detroit Catholic Central in a Division I quarterfinal matchup. Underwood bypassed Michigan in January two days before the Wolverines defeated Washington in the national championship game. At that time, there was heavy speculation that coach Jim Harbaugh would not return to Michigan. Harbaugh indeed left for the NFL's Los Angeles Chargers and he was replaced by offensive coordinator Sherrone Moore, who is 5-5 this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Ohtani was named National League Most Valuable Player following his first season with the Los Angeles Dodgers, while Judge won his second American League MVP in three seasons with the New York Yankees. For the third time in four years, Ohtani won a league MVP award by unanimous vote; last year he became the only player to do so multiple times. Judge was also the unanimous winner in the AL, the 20th player to accomplish the feat. Francisco Lindor of the New York Mets finished second in NL voting and Ketel Marte of the Arizona Diamondbacks was third. In the AL, Kansas City Royals star Bobby Witt Jr. received all 30 second-place votes and Judge's Yankee teammate Juan Soto finished third. The honor for Ohtani caps a particularly memorable month after he helped the Dodgers to the franchise's second championship in 36 seasons with a five-game World Series win over the Yankees. Ohtani, 30, became just the second player to win the MVP in both leagues after Frank Robinson did it in 1961 with the NL's Cincinnati Reds and in 1966 with the AL's Baltimore Orioles. He also became the first MVP winner while playing as his team's primary designated hitter. A shoulder injury prevented Ohtani from pitching this past season, but as a two-way player for the Los Angeles Angels, he won unanimous AL MVPs in both 2021 and 2023. In 159 games during the 2024 regular season, Ohtani batted .310 and led the NL in OPS (1.036), slugging percentage (.646), home runs (54) and RBIs (130). He became the first player to hit 50 homers and steal 50 bases, taking 59. He narrowly missed out on the league's triple crown, finishing second for the NL batting title to the San Diego Padres' Luis Arraez (.314). In the first postseason of his career, Ohtani batted .230 with a .767 OPS, with three home runs and 10 RBIs. He injured his shoulder in Game 2 of the World Series yet continued to play and batted just .105 with no RBIs in five games. Ohtani had shoulder surgery after the World Series ended and is expected to be ready to play by the start of spring training. Judge, 32, led the Yankees to the World Series after batting .322 with a 1.159 OPS in 158 games this past regular season. He also had an MLB-best 58 home runs with 144 RBIs. His home-run total did not match the 62 he hit while winning the AL MVP in 2022, but his OPS was better than his 1.111 mark from that season. Judge did not win the MVP in 2023 after a toe injury cost him more than a month. In 14 postseason games in October, Judge batted just .184 with a .752 OPS, including three home runs and nine RBIs. In five World Series games, he batted .222 with a lone home run that came early in Game 5 before the Dodgers rallied to win the title. During the 2024 regular season, Judge set career highs in batting average, on-base percentage (.458), slugging percentage (.701). OPS, hits (180), doubles (36), RBIs and walks (133). He was named to the AL All-Star team for the sixth time. While Ohtani was playing the first season of a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers, Judge was in the second season of a nine-year, $360 million contract with the Yankees. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Purdy is dealing with a right shoulder injury and the 49ers are also potentially without left tackle Trent Williams and Nick Bosa due to injuries. Bosa was listed as out of Thursday's practice with an oblique injury. Williams also didn't suit up Thursday. He played through an ankle injury last week after being listed as questionable.

An has never won on the LPGA Tour, but she finished 29th in the points race thanks to four top-10 finishes. Now she is in great position to land a massive victory. Angel Yin is alone in second, one stroke behind An, and Marina Alex and Allisen Corpuz are tied for third at 6 under. Lydia Ko of New Zealand is in striking distance of the lead after shooting a 5-under 67, part of a six-way tie for fifth.

Though a $4 million paycheck is enticing, she said her attitude this week is that a tournament is a tournament. ""I think that mindset is good for make the focus during my play,"" An said. Yin, 26, was 2 over through four holes before turning things around. She got into red figures with three birdies before the end of the front nine, and she poured in four birdies between Nos. 10 and 14. Then, at the par-5 17th, she punctuated her day with an eagle 3. ""Started out a little bit rocky just because I was trying to adjust to the golf course,"" the Los Angeles native said. ""Golf course is playing quite difficult with the early winds this morning, which I really like and I enjoy, because it's our last tournament and it's a huge purse, bigger than a major. Doesn't have a title of a major, but I think it deserves every bit of difficulty it brings to closing the season out."" Alex, 34, also made a jump by eagling the 17th, but not the way she planned it. After a second shot she was unhappy with, she chipped in on her third. ""(On 17 she was) just like classically in the worst place I could have been, left and slightly long of that particular pin,"" the two-time winner from New Jersey said. ""... I thought I hit a nice chip. I was expecting it to be, I don't know, 10 to 15 feet, which was what I was going to be happy with trying to convert, and hit the pin and went in. ""Just you need some good breaks. Occasionally that kind of stuff happens."" Former U.S. Women's Open champ Corpuz had a bogey-free day, while Ko carded six birdies and one bogey. Ko is trying to polish off perhaps the best year of her career after she already collected an Olympic gold medal and the Women's Open title. She also qualified for the LPGA Hall of Fame and was inducted last month. ""I think this is the type of golf course where it's not like one fights into this type of golf course,"" Ko said.

Winnipeg's second and third defeats of the season came in a 4-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning on Nov. 14 and a 5-0 shutout to the Florida Panthers on Nov. 16. The Jets got a chance at immediate revenge against the Panthers on Tuesday, and capitalized with a 6-3 victory on home ice. ""We didn't like the way we played in Florida. So it's just a sign of a lot of good character in this room that we wanted to bounce back,"" said Mark Scheifele, who had a hat trick on Tuesday. ""We wanted to have a good game in front of our home crowd before we go on the road for what feels like forever."" Friday marks the start of a six-game road trip for the Jets, who are 7-2-0 in away games this season. The Penguins are 1-2-2 in their last five games, and have been struggling to either gain or hold leads. In the first two games of their five-game homestand, the Penguins almost blew a three-goal lead in Saturday's 4-3 shootout win over the San Jose Sharks, and then lost a two-goal lead in Tuesday's 3-2 overtime loss to the Lightning. Pittsburgh is 4-5-2 when scoring first in games, the lowest winning percentage (.364) of any team in the NHL when taking the early lead. ""We like parts of our game but I think we've just got to get more comfortable and just got to put 60 minutes together ... We have the leads in the game, we're right where we want to be and we let it slip,"" Penguins forward Rickard Rakell said. Keeping leads is always difficult with a leaky defense, and the Penguins have allowed the most goals (81) in the NHL. Pittsburgh's skaters have a combined -127 plus-minus rating, and goaltenders Alex Nedeljkovic, Tristan Jarry and Joel Blomqvist have a cumulative 3.62 goals-against average. Defenseman Kris Letang is questionable for Friday's lineup after missing Pittsburgh's last three games due to illness. It adds up for a great opportunity for the scorching Jets offense to keep lighting the lamp. Winnipeg is among the league leaders with an average of 4.21 goals per game. Since the Penguins host the Utah Hockey Club on Saturday, Nedeljkovic and Jarry figure to split the back-to-back starts in some order. The Jets are also playing consecutive games, as the team faces the Predators in Nashville on Saturday. Backup goalie Eric Comrie might be likelier to face Pittsburgh, as starter Connor Hellebuyck may be saved to face Winnipeg's Central Division rivals. Sidney Crosby could achieve another milestone Friday, as the Penguins star is sitting on 599 career NHL goals. Still a potent force in his 20th NHL season, Crosby leads Pittsburgh with 20 points (seven goals, 13 assists). Scheifele and Kyle Connor share the Jets' team scoring lead with 24 points apiece. Both players have an even 12 goals and 12 assists. In the first meeting between the two teams this season, the Jets collected a 6-3 win over the Penguins in Winnipeg on Oct. 20. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""I got a little blood on my elbow, a little blood on my nose. My ankle,"" Craig said. ""I like games like that."" With injuries opening a spot for Craig in the starting lineup, the bump-and-shove looks to continue for the Bulls, who hope the frontcourt veteran's energetic influence rubs off. Chicago has lost eight of 11 entering Friday's visit from the Atlanta Hawks. Starting in place of Patrick Williams, who's expected to miss at least a week with left foot inflammation, Craig scored 15 points while snagging six rebounds in a 122-106 loss to the Bucks, matching Nikola Vucevic for the team high on the glass. ""It's no secret; you've just got to want the ball,"" Craig said. ""I'm a competitor. The ball's up, I try to compete for it."" Craig missed Chicago's Nov. 9 game at Atlanta due to illness. The Bulls won 125-113 behind 19 points from Ayo Dosunmu and Vucevic's 18-point, 12-rebound double-double. Coby White and Zach LaVine also scored 18 points. Bulls coach Billy Donovan said LaVine ""carried us"" against the Bucks, who closed the game on an 18-4 run. LaVine scored 20 of his 27 points before halftime and shot 9 of 15 for the game, including 4 of 7 from 3-point range. ""I've seen his shot-making; it's been incredible,"" Donovan said. ""He has the ability to get on a roll."" Atlanta is eyeing a split of a four-game road trip that has sandwiched losses at Portland and Golden State around a one-point victory in Sacramento. The Hawks lost 120-97 at Golden State on Wednesday, scoring just four points more than their season low. ""I didn't think that we talked enough tonight,"" said Atlanta coach Quin Snyder, whose team shot 33.3 percent, including just 26.7 percent (12 of 45) from deep. ""And sometimes that happens when you're not making shots and it's actually when you need each other, and even more. ""Regardless of who's in the game, how long they play, we can run. You can run. You can see that there's a corner and it's empty and you can fill it, and you can see where the ball is and you can space, and doing that gives us a chance to get connected."" Atlanta played with its full rotation against the Warriors. After missing the Sacramento game with left leg inflammation, Jalen Johnson posted a double-double of 15 points and 14 rebounds to lead six Hawks in double-figure scoring. Trae Young (12 points, 11 assists) and Clint Capela (11 points, 10 rebounds) also contributed double-doubles. Friday marks the resumption of NBA Cup play. Atlanta is seeking a 3-0 start in East Group C after previous victories at Boston and against Washington. The Bulls lost their lone group play contest to date, at Cleveland. Group play will continue on Tuesdays and Fridays through Dec. 3 to determine an elimination bracket later in the month. The winner of each group plus one wild card from each conference will advance to the knockout rounds. Chicago has won six of 10 against Atlanta. LaVine has shot 53.6 percent while averaging 25.4 points in his past 10 games against the Hawks. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Capitals announced Tuesday that Ovechkin was considered week-to-week as he underwent further evaluation on his leg. On Wednesday, the team placed him on injured reserve and recalled forward prospect Ivan Miroshnichenko from AHL affiliate Hershey. The injury interrupted Ovechkin while he was on a hot streak. He scored two goals in the Utah game before going down and has 13 goals in his past 11. Before Thursday's games, he owned the NHL lead with 15 goals on the season.

While Kentucky claims eight NCAA Tournament crowns and the most wins in college basketball history, Jackson State has never won an NCAA Tournament game and enters the matchup looking for its first win of the season. Impressive tradition and current record aside, Kentucky (4-0) returned no scholarship players from last season's team that was knocked off by Oakland in the NCAA Tournament. New coach Mark Pope and his essentially all-new Wildcats are off to a promising start. Through four games, Kentucky is averaging 94.3 points per game, and with 11.5 3-pointers made per game, the team is on pace to set a school record from long distance. The Wildcats boast six double-figure scorers with transfer guards Otega Oweh (from Oklahoma, 15.0 ppg) and Koby Brea (from Dayton, 14.5 ppg) leading the team. The Wildcats defeated Duke 77-72 on Nov. 12 but showed few signs of an emotional letdown in Tuesday's 97-68 win over a Lipscomb team picked to win the Atlantic Sun Conference in the preseason. Kentucky drained a dozen 3-pointers while outrebounding their visitors 43-28. Guard Jaxson Robinson, held to a single point by Duke, dropped 20 points to lead the Kentucky attack. Afterward, Pope praised his team's focus, saying, ""The last game was over and it was kind of on to, ‘How do we get better?' That's the only thing we talk about."" Lipscomb coach Lennie Acuff also delivered a ringing endorsement, calling Kentucky ""the best offensive Power Four team we've played in my six years at Lipscomb."" Jackson State (0-5) and third-year coach Mo Williams are looking for something positive to build upon. Not only are the Tigers winless, but they have lost each game by nine or more points. Sophomore guard Jayme Mitchell Jr. (13.8 ppg) is the leading scorer, but the team shoots just 35.8 percent while allowing opponents to shoot 52.3 percent. The Tigers played on Wednesday at Western Kentucky, where they lost 79-62. Reserve Tamarion Hoover had a breakout game with 18 points to lead Jackson State, but the host Hilltoppers canned 14 3-point shots and outrebounded the Tigers 42-35 to grab the win. Earlier, Williams, who played against Kentucky while a student at Alabama, admitted the difficulties of a challenging nonconference schedule for his team. ""Our goal is not to win 13 nonconference games,"" Williams said. ""We're already at a disadvantage in that regard. We use these games to get us ready for conference play and for March Madness."" Jackson State has not made the NCAA Tournament since 2007. The Tigers had a perfect regular-season record (11-0) in the Southwestern Athletic Conference in 2020-21 but lost in the league tournament. Kentucky has never played Jackson State before, but the game is being billed as part of a Unity Series of matchups in which Kentucky hosts members of the SWAC to raise awareness of Historical Black Colleges and Universities and provide funds for those schools. Past Unity Series opponents have been Southern in December 2021 and Florida A&M in December 2022. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Sure enough, the Bucks have won four of their last five games heading into an NBA Cup matchup against the visiting Indiana Pacers on Friday. While Milwaukee is trending upward, Indiana has dropped four of its last five games. The Pacers shot 5 of 22 (22.7 percent) from 3-point range in a 130-113 loss to the Houston Rockets on Wednesday. Indiana will look to bounce back against the Bucks and star Giannis Antetokounmpo, who had 41 points, nine rebounds and eight assists in a 122-106 home win over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday. Brook Lopez was among several players who struggled during the team's dismal start, but the 7-foot-1 center is averaging 19 points on 55.4 percent shooting over his last five games. ""We know the team that we are,"" Lopez said. ""We've known the team that we are all season long, we just had to prove it by winning games. It's gotten better and better. Obviously, the last few, we're happy with winning, they were close ones but we put in a lot of work, we're doing great."" The Bucks looked like a championship contender late in Wednesday's contest, when they closed the game on an 18-4 run. After the victory, Rivers reflected on his team's rough start to the season. ""I felt good about the team, I just didn't feel good about our record, to be honest,"" Rivers said. ""I still feel that way -- I don't feel good about our record yet -- but I do feel good about this team. I feel really good about this team."" Indiana coach Rick Carlisle isn't quite as pleased with his team, and he suggested changes could be coming following another disappointing loss on Wednesday. ""We're not playing well. That's obvious,"" Carlisle said. ""Our connectedness is not where it needs to be. Our collective spirit is not where it needs to be. I'm going to look very closely at the film tonight. The coaching staff is. We have to come up with answers."" The Pacers desperately need more production from All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton, who was held to four points on 1-of-7 shooting against Houston, including 1 of 5 from 3-point range. Haliburton is averaging 12.6 points while shooting 30.3 percent from the field and 30.8 percent (12 of 39) from 3-point range over his last five games. One bright spot in Wednesday's loss was the play of guard Quenton Jackson, who scored a career-high 24 points on 10-of-12 shooting in his first career start. Jackson also had three assists, two rebounds, two steals and a block in 27 minutes. ""Quenton Jackson is an example of where we need everybody's spirit to be,"" Carlisle said. ""The guy is flying all over the place, playing at a ridiculously high level of intensity and unselfishness and totally surrendering to the team, you know? For us, we just have to work at adopting that on a full-time basis and really being there for each other."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

With NBA Cup home wins over the Dallas Mavericks and Memphis Grizzlies under their belt, the Warriors will be looking not only to remain as the only unbeaten team in West Group C but also improve their point differential should it become needed. The Pelicans beat the Denver Nuggets in their only previous home game in the in-season tournament. At 1-1, they are tied with the Nuggets and Mavericks for second place in the group, but could drop the Warriors back to the pack with a win Friday. New Orleans has struggled big-time since its 101-94 victory over the Nuggets last Friday, falling to the Los Angeles Lakers, Mavericks and Cleveland Cavaliers by a total of 74 points. They are coming off a 128-100 shellacking at Cleveland on Wednesday. One positive from Wednesday's game was the play of rookie guard Antonio Reeves, who exploded for 34 points in a season-high 40 minutes. The Kentucky product had totaled just 23 points in his first eight games, and wasn't even on the active roster when the Pelicans were swept in a pair of October games at Golden State. But with Zion Williamson, Trey Murphy III, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, Dejounte Murray, Herbert Jones, Jordan Hawkins and Jose Alvarado all out of the lineup, Reeves took advantage of an opportunity coach Willie Green said he worked hard to get. ""It's a credit to (coach) Jodie Meeks and our Birmingham Squadron (G League) team,"" Green insisted. ""(Reeves) coming into the gym every day, getting his shots up, paying attention, and gameplan discipline. It all pays off when you get on the floor."" Already winners of six road games this season, the Warriors have no such health issues. They are missing only De'Anthony Melton, ruled out of the season this week with a partially torn left ACL. Lindy Waters III has stepped into Melton's starting spot and contributed at least two 3-pointers to each of Golden State's last three games. He had 10 points in Wednesday's 120-97 home win over the Atlanta Hawks. Buddy Hield (11 points) and Jonathan Kuminga (10) were among five others who also scored in double figures for the Warriors. They did so off the bench. Keeping them together was a big part in the decision to promote Waters, Warriors coach Steve Kerr noted after Wednesday's win. ""He's a good fit next to that group,"" Kerr said of a starting lineup that includes Stephen Curry, Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green and Trayce Jackson-Davis. ""I like bringing Buddy off the bench. The bench group has been really good this year. Starting with Lindy allows us to keep the bench intact and gives us another shooter and defender in the starting lineup."" Waters had 21 points as a reserve and Hield 28 as a starter when their roles were reversed in a 124-106 home win over the Pelicans last month that tipped off a two-game, same-site series. Hield (21 points) returned to the bench for the rematch, a 104-89 Golden State triumph that allowed them to complete a sweep without Curry, who was nursing a strained left ankle. -Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

McNealy began the week at the par-70 Seaside Course and fired an 8-under-par 62, with one eagle, six birdies and no bogeys on his card. Thorbjornsen, meanwhile, shot a bogey-free, 8-under 64 at the par-72 Plantation Course. They will switch courses on Friday before everyone who makes the cut plays the Seaside Course on Saturday and Sunday. McNealy and Thorbjornsen are one shot ahead of Andrew Novak, who posted a 7-under 65 at the Plantation Course. PGA Tour rookie Adrien Dumont de Chassart of Belgium recorded a career-low 64 at the Seaside Course to get his week going, and he's in a tie for fourth at 6 under with Chandler Phillips (66, Plantation).

It was part of an 11-1 run, capped by a 3-pointer from Tandy that made it 75-68 with 2:41 remaining.

However, a few things are playing in Pittsburgh's favor as Week 12 of the NFL regular season kicks off. Namely, the ""trip"" to Cleveland is a little more than two hours by road and when the Steelers arrive there, they'll be facing a backup quarterback at the helm of a massively underwhelming 2-8 Browns team. The Steelers (8-2) are coming off a huge win over Baltimore to stay atop the AFC North. And Pittsburgh is beginning to set its sights on potential home-field advantage come playoff time.  ODDS AND TRENDS The Steelers are a consensus 3.5-point favorite. That includes at BetRivers, where they have been backed by 80 percent of the spread-line money. Pittsburgh's -195 moneyline to simply win the game has been even more popular, drawing 95 percent of all money wagered. The Browns enter Thursday night having failed to cover the spread in nine of their past 12 games. Meanwhile, the Steelers have covered the spread in every game during their five-game win streak. The 37.0 total points line has seen the Over backed by 65 percent of the money and 70 percent of the total bets. Each of Cleveland's past eight November home games has gone under the total points line. PROP PICKS --Steelers WR George Pickens Over 50 Receiving Yards (-195 at DraftKings): Russell Wilson has thrown six touchdowns in the four games since he took over as the starting quarterback. Two of those have gone to Pickens, who has at least 74 receiving yards in each of those games. There is some concern that Pittsburgh gains a big early lead and turns to a run-heavy attack, but Wilson throws an excellent deep ball and that plays into Pickens' strength. This is the most popular player prop at the book. --Steelers RB Najee Harris Anytime TD (+100 at BetRivers): That potential for a run-heavy approach should benefit Harris, who found the sledding tough against Baltimore with 63 yards on the ground. He was also held out of the end zone for the second time in three games. Keep in mind that Cleveland has allowed only three touchdowns on the ground all season, but the Browns have allowed 12 through the air. Harris has a trio of scores on the ground and receiving through 10 games. KEY STAT The Browns have won the first quarter in five consecutive home games against the Steelers. THE NEWS The Steelers have certainly been locked in. They are currently riding a five-game winning streak, most recently edging the Baltimore Ravens 18-16 on Sunday.   Chris Boswell booted six field goals against Baltimore, while Wilson completed 23 of 36 passes for 205 yards and an interception.   Meanwhile, Cleveland continues to go through the wringer. The Browns ended up on the wrong end of a 35-14 blowout while facing the host New Orleans Saints on Sunday, marking their seventh loss in the past eight games.   Cleveland now has to go up against one of the most unforgiving defenses in the league. Browns quarterback Jameis Winston is determined to direct a fundamentally sound performance against Pittsburgh, which allows the second-fewest points per game in the NFL (16.2).   ""It's precision passing. Getting the ball out on time. Elite operation and just doing our job. It's the simple things,"" Winston said. ""This team (the Steelers) is not going to try and fool you. They're going to line up and say, 'Give us your best, we're going to give you our best.'""   Winston threw for 395 yards and two touchdowns on 30-for-46 passing in the setback against New Orleans, with Jerry Jeudy hauling in six catches for 142 yards and a score. Star running back Nick Chubb continued to struggle since his return from a knee injury that cut his 2023 season short, finishing with 50 yards on 11 carries.   INJURY REPORT The Browns could be without standout defensive end Myles Garrett, who missed practice on Tuesday because of a hip injury. Wide receiver Elijah Moore (shoulder), guard Joel Bitonio (pectoral) and cornerbacks Denzel Ward (ribs/ankle) and Greg Newsome II (shoulder) were among those limited during the session.   Linebacker Alex Highsmith is dealing with an ankle issue and was ruled out by the Steelers along with cornerback Cory Trice Jr. (hamstring). THEY SAID IT Wilson is starting to feel like he might be part of something special, but he also doesn't want Pittsburgh to get ahead of itself.   ""I definitely think that we have a chance (to make a deep playoff run),"" said Wilson, who has played in two Super Bowls. ""I think the biggest thing for us is continuing to just take each week as the most important week of it all.   ""I think that it's not really even just the week, it's just the day, it's just the moments in between. I think the greatest teams, the greatest players, in any sport, especially the teams I've been on, is the moment -- it's never too far away. It's right here, right now. And you're just locked into that."" PREDICTION Divisional road games on short weeks typically shape up as a daunting task. That's not the case for the Steelers, who will be hyper-focused to put this one out of reach early before enjoying 10 days ahead of a trip to Cleveland. With a second game against the Browns before a huge game at Philadelphia, this is not an under-manned opponent Pittsburgh will look past. --Steelers 27, Browns 19   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The journey ended on Wednesday in a 117-111 loss at Memphis, despite 2023 MVP Joel Embiid playing his best game of the season.  Embiid finished with game highs of 35 points and 11 rebounds in his fourth contest since rejoining the Sixers lineup, after missing the first nine games with a lingering knee injury.  Philadelphia is winless in Embiid's four appearances, have only two wins this season and none in NBA Cup action. The Sixers opened group play with a 111-99 loss to the New York Knicks on Nov. 12, followed by a 98-86 road loss to the Orlando Magic on Nov. 15.  Philadelphia is now also dealing with another knee injury to a key player, as Paul George left Wednesday's game with a hyperextension. ""Similar to the preseason,"" Sixers coach Nick Nurse said, referring to an injury George sustained in October. ""We're going to find out more (Thursday) when (the medical staff) checks it out to see what the extent of it is."" Nurse said George's injury may be akin to a bone bruise, which would not require a lengthy absence. Still, the team is awaiting more details ahead of Friday's return home. ""You never know what happens,"" Nurse said. ""He was actually fairly close to coming back in the game but then it stiffened up as he got out a little bit more, so we decided not to."" Amid the rash of injuries and roster tumult, rookie Jared McCain is emerging as a bright spot in the Sixers' dismal start. Wednesday's 20-point performance marked the guard's sixth consecutive game scoring 20-plus points. McCain has made at least three 3-pointers in all six of those contests, while he averaged 25.5 points. The Nets ended a three-game losing streak Tuesday and improved to 1-1 in the NBA Cup, with a 116-115 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. Cam Johnson scored 34 points, while Trendon Watford hit a jumper with 38 seconds remaining that gave the Nets necessary breathing room down the stretch.  Watford finished with 10 points over 19 minutes in just his second game back from a hamstring injury sustained in training camp. ""Very happy that he had the game that he had, but that to me is the definition of a team,"" Nets coach Jordi Fernandez said. ""Our medical staff worked hard to get him back healthy.

Darnold already has eight wins, beating the 7-10 mark the Vikings cobbled together with a QB room that spun on fast forward from Cousins, Jaren Hall, Nick Mullens, and Joshua Dobbs. ""What we're trying to get from Sam is play the best football of his career,"" O'Connell said.  Darnold is delivering and the Vikings have a three-game winning streak in tow when they arrive at Soldier Field on Sunday. He has posted a 100.0 passer rating in 10 starts. He has completed a career-best 67.9 percent of his passes for 2,387 yards, 19 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. The next touchdown pass will mark a career high for Darnold, who sputtered with the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers before serving as the San Francisco 49ers' backup last season. ""I just feel like, you know -- not talking about past experiences at all -- but I think here it's the detail that we've had ever since OTAs, ever since April,"" Darnold said. ""We've been able to lock in our progressions. Just our feet, our eyes, where they're supposed to be. And just being on time with the concepts. ""If you play like that, it makes the quarterback position a little bit easier."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Buckeyes (3-1) routed visiting Evansville 80-30 on Tuesday, outscoring the Purple Aces 52-16 in the second half. It was the fewest points allowed by the Buckeyes since a 59-22 home win over Samford on Nov. 29, 2008. ""We were consistently good defensively against a team that I think has some really good players and some good offensive firepower,"" Ohio State coach Jake Diebler said. ""I was impressed with that. ""I thought it showed great maturity and connectiveness for our team. There is a lot of newness in the program. But I've been impressed with how connected we have been defensively."" Campbell (3-2) will present its own defensive mindset that resulted in an 86-66 road win over Navy on Sunday. ""The consistent on-ball pressure has a way of keeping teams out of rhythm,"" Campbell coach Kevin McGeehan. The Fighting Camels are forcing opponents into 17.8 turnovers per game by going deep into the bench to bring the effort the coach wants. ""There's not much drop-off,"" McGeehan said. ""There's a little bit of a learning curve for us as far as rotation and what's working and how we can use guys in different spots right now, which is natural with any team at the beginning of the year. ""As far as the ability to execute the plan, the ability to bring the defensive fervor and intensity to the situation and establishing our identity defensively, it's a plus."" Campbell will meet three power-conference teams in a season for the first time since 2011-12. The Fighting Camels lost 65-56 at Virginia on Nov. 6 and play at North Carolina on Dec. 29. McGeehan likes the challenges in facing these programs. ""These teams are all physical and tough, and we want to sharpen ourselves and test ourselves again and again and again so we're the team that is imposing that on someone else when we need it the most,"" he said. Jasin Sinani is the only Campell player averaging double figures with 11.6 points per game. He also leads the team with 5.2 rebounds and 28.8 minutes per game. The Buckeyes have three players averaging double figures: Bruce Thornton (13.8), John Mobley Jr. (13.5) and Devin Royal (10.5). Royal also is pulling down a team-best 7.5 rebounds per game, while Thornton is dishing five assists per contest. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Washington's losing streak began after the Wizards won two in a row to even their record at 2-2. Eight of the nine losses have come by double digits. Washington dropped a 124-104 home decision to Detroit on Sunday, and then had its losing streak reach nine games with Monday's 134-106 setback at New York. The Wizards have allowed at least 120 points in each of their last four games. Following Monday's loss, Washington coach Brian Keefe made it clear he was frustrated with the team's effort in the last two games. ""I'm the leader of this team,"" Keefe said. ""I'm the head coach of this team, so I'll take the responsibility for the last two nights not playing up to the competitive disposition that we should be playing with, especially defensively. That will be addressed as a group and we will get better. But that wasn't what we need to be, what our standards were. And we have to own that. And we have to look at ourselves and we have to get better."" Washington forward Corey Kispert said the Wizards' compete-level has not been where it needs to be. ""It's been a bad few showings for us, and we can deal with losing if we're competitive, (if) we come ready to play,"" Kispert said. ""But (to not) be ready to play at all and (to not) compete, that's absolutely unacceptable."" Washington is 0-1 in NBA Cup play this season. Boston improved its NBA Cup record to 1-1 by beating Cleveland 120-117 on Tuesday. It was Cleveland's first loss after a 15-0 start this season. Boston received a strong performance from 38-year-old center Al Horford on Tuesday. Horford had a season-high 20 points to go with seven rebounds and three blocked shots. He made four 3-pointers and had two blocks late when the Cavaliers were trying to complete a comeback after trailing by 21 points. ""It was just about finishing the job,"" Horford said. ""I felt like we played really well in the first half. In the third, they cut into the lead, and in the fourth they got in there and it was a back-and-forth. It was like, man, we put ourselves in a position, we gotta finish this and see it through."" Boston's Jayson Tatum had 33 points, 12 rebounds, seven assists and two steals during the victory. ""Al is just a calming presence out there,"" Tatum said. ""He just does so many different things for us. Sometimes they show up in the stat sheet and sometimes they don't, but just him being on the court with us helps our spacing, helps our defense. He's such a good passer, willing passer. So we're just a much better team when Al is out there and being aggressive."" The Celtics enter Friday's game on a three-game winning streak and have won five of their last six. Boston is 7-1 in road games this season. Washington is 1-5 at home. Friday's game will be the second meeting between the teams this season. Boston earned a 122-102 road victory on Oct. 24. Boston's Jaylen Brown scored a game-high 27 points in that matchup, which extended Boston's winning streak against Washington to five games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Trailblazers (1-3) fell 86-69 at Wyoming last Saturday. ""You know, a couple plays here or there and the score flips, and we're super happy,"" Utah coach Craig Smith told ESPN 700 in Salt Lake City. ""This is a good team we just played (Sunday), and it's that type of team we're going to see in the Big 12."" Miro Little gave Utah a 39-28 lead at the break after hitting back-to-back 3-pointers, but Mississippi State began the second half with a 22-5 surge and punished the Utes in the final minutes from the free-throw line, draining 7 of 8 attempts in the final 73 seconds. Utah's leading scorer, Gabe Madsen, was limited to nine points while going 1-for-10 from 3-point territory. Ezra Ausar topped Utah with 15 points, Mason Madsen scored 14 and Keanu Dawes chipped in with his first career double-double of 13 points and 12 rebounds. The Friday game kicks off a six-game homestand for Utah, which won the first three games of the season by at least 31 points. Utah Tech will take on Utah for just the third time in history. The first game was a 41-26 Utah win in 1928. Much more recently, the Utes won 83-64 on Jan. 9, 2008. The Trailblazers are in the early stages of an eight-game road trip. It began in Wyoming and will include a three-game stop at the Stew Morrill Classic in Missoula, Mont., before continuing on at Portland State, Boise State and Utah State. Tennessee Rainwater led Utah Tech against Wyoming with a career-best 16 points, while Beon Riley (14), Noa Gonsalves (13) and Britton Berrett (12) also had double-digit scoring outings. Utah Tech's only win this season was a 90-59 home victory over Bethesda of the National Christian College Athletic Association. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Jones read a prepared statement, saying he wanted to make sure he clearly shared the words and sentiment he felt needed to be aired after losing the starting job to former undrafted free agent Tommy DeVito. In his first public comments on the decision made by head coach Brian Daboll after a team meeting on Monday, Jones spoke in the past tense about his time with the Giants (2-8), a strong signal that a professional divorce is imminent. ""The opportunity to play for the New York Giants was truly a dream come true and I am extremely grateful ... for the chance to play here,"" Jones said Thursday. ""The Giants are truly a first-class organization and I have nothing but genuine respect and appreciation for the people who built it and who help carry on the tradition. I've met so many special people and created relationships that will truly last a lifetime. Thank you to all my teammates, coaches and staff that have done so much for me these past six years. There have been some great times, but of course we all wish there had been more of those."" Ranked 32nd among all qualified quarterbacks in passer rating this season, Jones has eight touchdowns and seven interceptions in 2024. He also carries an injury guarantee worth $23 million for this season that the Giants likely don't want to risk paying only to cut ties with him in the offseason. Jones, 27, was a first-round pick in 2019 and signed a four-year, $160 million contract in 2023. He suffered a season-ending ACL tear last season but returned in time to start the season as the No. 1 quarterback. He was benched with a record of 3-13 over his past 16 starts. The remainder of Jones' contract can be partially wiped off the books if he's released before March 2025. ""I take full responsibility for my part in not bringing more wins. No one wanted to win more games worse than me and I gave everything I had on the field and in my preparation,"" Jones continued. ""Of course, this season has been disappointing for all, and of course I wish I could've done more. I'm 100 percent accountable for my part. I did not play well enough, consistently enough help the team get the results. The reality of the NFL is it's hard to win games and requires consistent performance from everyone involved. We didn't do that well enough so the idea to change something happens, and I understand. ""I love the game, I love being part of a team and I'm excited for the next opportunity. I know that there's a lot of good football in front of me and I'm excited about that,"" Jones said. ""To all fans, I have deep respect and appreciation for your passion and love for the Giants. The fans are huge part of what makes playing for the Giants so special."" Asked about his statement being written past-tense, Jones said he's still processing the bigger picture. ""I think I'm still processing and, for now, I'm doing the best I can to help (quarterback) Tommy (DeVito) prepare, help the team prepare. That's what I'm going to do right now. So, processing that,"" Jones said.  ""Obviously, a decision was made and I'm not playing. That's what that was framed as."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Both USC (5-5, 3-5 Big Ten) and UCLA (4-6, 3-5) are playing for their bowl-game lives. A loss eliminates the Bruins from bowl participation in their first year of Big Ten membership, while falling at UCLA would send the Trojans into their regular-season finale against top 10-ranked Notre Dame needing a victory to land a bowl bid. The winner of the Victory Bowl this year also takes the lead in what has been one of the most competitive stretches in the rivalry's history. The teams are 6-6 over the last 12 meetings dating back to 2012 and have exchanged wins in the last four encounters. The home team has not won since a 52-35 decision for USC in 2019. UCLA continued the run of road wins last season with a 38-20 victory at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, sparked by quarterback Ethan Garbers' three passing touchdowns and a 142-yard rushing effort from running back T.J. Harden. Garbers heads into Saturday's matchup on a run of four consecutive games passing for multiple touchdowns, but his two last week came in UCLA's first loss of that stretch in a 31-19 setback vs. Washington. The Bruins' rushing offense is among the nation's least productive at 85.4 yards per game and regressed to 52 yards last week after posting season-highs of 139 and 211 at Nebraska and vs. Iowa, respectively. ""I would like to see us deal with adverse situations better,"" said Bruins coach DeShaun Foster on Tuesday when asked about injuries on the offensive line. ""We're not going to make excuses. Foster was a UCLA running back from 1998-2001, after he was recruited as a defensive back by USC, and knows all about the cross-town rivalry. ""I'm just glad we have another opportunity to play,"" Foster added. ""This type of game is one that can get us back on track."" A prominent figure on Saturday, who switched sidelines from a season ago, is USC defensive coordinator D'Anton Lynn, who held the same post at UCLA in 2023.  ""The culture defensively within our program has shifted in a lot of ways,"" said Trojans head coach Lincoln Riley, who is 1-1 against the Bruins. ""I'm really proud of how we've progressed schematically. I'm really proud of how we've progressed fundamentally.""  The Trojans' defense is allowing 22 points per game this season under Lynn after surrendering 34.4 per game in 2023.  USC is looking for back-to-back wins for the first time since Weeks 1 and 2 against LSU and Utah State. The Trojans ended their streak of one-possession losses in conference play, having dropped each of the previous five games decided by one score before last week's 28-20 victory over Nebraska. Quarterback Jayden Maiava recovered from an early pick-six in his first career start to go 25-of-35 passing for 259 yards and three touchdowns. He spread the ball to six pass-catchers who had at least receptions, while Woody Marks rushed for 146 yards on 19 carries. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""Pretty much, yes,"" Piastro said this week when asked if team strategy has changed. Red Bull Racing's Max Verstappen leads the drivers' standings with 393 points, while Norris is second with 331, followed by Ferrari's Charles Leclerc (307) and Piastri (262). Dubbed the ""papaya rules,"" Piastri was required to make sure Norris could secure as many points as possible to keep the pressure on Verstappen. That meant Piastri was forced to back off a sprint race at Brazil on Nov. 3, to let Norris pass for overall points considerations. Norris ended up finishing in sixth place to earn eight points, while Verstappen went on to win and earn 26 points. Piastri finished eighth and earned four points. Piastri's ""pretty much,"" comment suggests that he is not quite free to operate as he pleases in all circumstances. ""There's still some, let's say, very specific scenarios where I might be needed to help out,"" Piastri said. ""But for the very large majority of situations, it's back to how it was.""

McLaren Mercedes heads to Las Vegas in the lead of the constructors' standings with 593 points, ahead of Ferrari (557) and Red Bull (544). To his credit, Piastri has not objected to operating in a support role for his teammate. His goal is to be the one who is getting all the help in 2025. ""Obviously next year, I want to make sure that I'm not in a position, championship-wise, to be subject to that,"" he said.

""Law enforcement officials have noted these groups appear to exploit team schedules to target athletes' homes on game days."" NBC News reported Wednesday that law enforcement is working to figure out whether an international crime syndicate is involved. The Athletic reported that the memo includes tips for home security and also gives recommendations about the use of social media, such as not posting photos of items that would attract thieves.

Jamal Mashburn Jr., who is averaging a team-high 23.5 points per game, finished with 23 points and four assists. However, he missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer at the end of the game. Steve Settle III, who is second with a 13.3 scoring average, tallied 10 of his 15 points in the first half. Mashburn, a fifth-year guard who transferred from New Mexico, has scored 20 or more points in each of the four games to open the season, which is the second time he has accomplished that feat in his career.

The son of Colorado head coach and Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders, Shedeur Sanders said Thursday he would cast a Heisman vote for Hunter.  ""If it's between me and him, I would want him to get it,"" Sanders said. ""He does a lot of amazing things and things that haven't been done before. I'm not a selfish guy. I know what he's capable of, so I would rather him win.""  Hunter said he would invite his QB to New York if he's not named a Heisman finalist before they go about the business of finishing the season, possibly in the 12-team College Football Playoff. Shedeur Sanders said he's the best quarterback in the draft, and doesn't believe that's anything new.  ""I feel like I was the best quarterback in the last draft, too,"" said Shedeur Sanders. ""Ever since I was draft eligible, I knew I'm the best quarterback. It's not up for me to prove myself to talking about why."" Former teammates at Jackson State where Deion Sanders also coached, Hunter said he felt his draft stock began to rise only after critics moved past ""the hate"" for his coach. A flashy, charismatic cornerback in the NFL after starring at Florida State, Deion Sanders was the fifth overall pick in the 1989 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons. Hall of Famers Troy Aikman (first, Cowboys), Barry Sanders (third, Lions) and Derrick Thomas (fourth, Chiefs) were chosen ahead of ""Prime Time"" along with offensive tackle Tony Mandarich (second, Packers).  Hunter has picked the brain of Deion Sanders about a dual role in pro sports. Sanders was used selectively as a wide receiver and returned punts but was primarily a cornerback in addition to playing Major League Baseball.  There's no base-stealing in Hunter's future, but he does believe he can push the envelope as a full-time two-way NFL player.  ""It's never been done,"" Hunter said. ""I understand that it will be a high risk, (teams) don't want their top pick to go down too early, and I know they're going to want me to be in a couple packages. But I believe I can do it. Nobody has stopped me from doing it thus far. I like when people tell me I can't do it."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Brown, promoted to offensive coordinator last week after Shane Waldron was fired, found some success last Sunday when Williams drove the Bears into position for a game-winning field goal that was blocked in a 20-19 loss to the Green Bay Packers.  What showed up on film when Williams and Brown huddled to review Week 11 was a tad different from the on-field results. Williams -- the No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft still feeling his way through the gradual progression of a franchise quarterback -- said the ""simplified"" offense isn't one that was whittled down to aid understanding. Rather, Brown brought such a finite degree of detail and thought to each play that his call sheet eventually will become a reference point with tens of dozens of subcontext for Williams to sort in real time.  ""We didn't reinvent the wheel for those three or four days that Thomas became the offensive coordinator and play caller,"" Williams said. ""I think the decisiveness, all of that came from our meetings and how we're going to do things. It came from being able to get play calls in faster and being able to get up there and not feel like you're rushed or not feel like you need to hurry up and get the ball snapped. ""All of these small things -- details of routes, details of the blocking, details of the path of running backs and how we're going to do things -- I think that led into all of what happened last week. We didn't come out with the win, but how we played efficiently and physically, that leads into it."" Fellow rookie and top-10 pick Rome Odunze felt like he was back at Washington for moments because of the rapidity with which Brown got calls to Williams, who relayed them to the huddle and hurried the team to the line of scrimmage with a newfound command.  There was a different type of clarity and confidence eminating from Brown down through the offensive chain of command on the field.  ""As wide receivers, we're kind of looking at the defense as well and reading those things along with Caleb. So understanding what kind of coverage look we're getting and what technique the DBs are playing on us allows us to kind of build a plan for that snap. Same thing with Caleb,"" Odunze said. ""He just has to do it at a higher level. So it helps us all."" Veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen said that in hindsight, the wheels started coming off for the Bears in training camp. In his opinion, Waldron was ""too nice,"" and he allowed mistakes and lack of detail and focus to become accepted.  ""That's football and that's life,"" Odunze said. ""Doing the little things right will eventually show on a bigger stage."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Mitch Mascari added 15 points. Nijel Pack led Miami (3-1) with 17 points and five assists. Matthew Cleveland and Jalen Blackmon added 12 points each.

Drake's new coach Ben McCollum, who won four national titles at NCAA Division II power at Northwest Missouri State between 2017 and 2022, engineered Thursday's upset. He did it with four starters he brought over from his former program -- Stirtz, Abreu, Mascari and Isaiah Jackson. The fifth starter is Wyoming transfer Cam Manyawu. Drake get off to a 7-0 start against the Hurricanes, and the Bulldogs kept rolling for a 36-27 advantage at the break. The Bulldogs dominated in several areas in the first half, including paint points (22-4); shooting percentage (48.4 percent to 30 percent); and offensive rebounds (7-1). Stirtz led Drake in the first half with 10 points and four assists. Three of those assists came on alley-oop passes that led to two Nate Ferguson dunks and a layup. Miami starters Lynn Kidd and Brandon Johnson did not score in the first half as Drake took the Hurricanes out of their normal offense. Miami played 10 players early, looking for answers. At the start of the second half, Miami put together a 9-2 run, cutting its deficit to 44-40 with 12:52 left.

Coach Jon Scheyer is bringing in a quartet of five-star recruits, headlined by Cameron Boozer, the No. 2 overall prospect in the 2025 class and son of Duke legend Carlos Boozer. He is joined by No. 15 Shelton Henderson (Bellaire High in Bellaire, Texas), No. 19 Nikolas Khamenia (Harvard-Westlake High, Los Angeles) and No. 21 Cayden Boozer, Cameron's twin. The Boozers play at Columbus High School in Miami. Cayden Boozer is a guard, and the others are forwards. Scheyer said Thursday that this group falls in line with the way he's trying to build the program since taking over from his mentor, Mike Krzyzewski. ""Individually with each of these guys, we're thrilled to get them here, but for me, it's the makeup of the class that I'm so excited about,"" he said. ""There's really two main things we look for in this class and ... the first thing is competitiveness. And when you think about Shelton Henderson, when you think about Cayden Boozer, when you think about Nik Khamenia, when you think about Cam Boozer, the word competitiveness comes to mind with all four of those guys. That was really important to us and how we continue to build the program. How we continue to move this thing forward is bring in high-level competitors.  ""The second thing for us is feel or basketball instincts, and when combine their competitiveness and you combine their IQ and feel for the game, that's been the recipe for some of our most special teams here."" Scheyer, who became Duke's head coach ahead of the 2022-23 season, signed the top class in 2022 and 2024 and the No. 2 class in the in-between year. The players already have achieved success in their careers. The Boozers played on three consecutive Florida state high school champions and also won gold medals in U16 and U17 competitions with USA Basketball. Khamenia won back-to-back state titles, and he and Henderson were members of the gold-medal winning U18 team at the FIBA AmeriCup over the summer.

The Tar Heels (2-1) are among the main attractions at the eight-team event in Maui, which also includes two-time reigning national champion UConn. Before North Carolina begins the tournament Monday against another 2024 NCAA Tournament team, Dayton, the Tar Heels contend with an undefeated Hawaii team on the island of Oahu. ""Getting on that time zone is important for us,"" North Carolina coach Hubert Davis said before making the trek to Hawaii. The matchup with the Rainbow Warriors tips off at 7:30 p.m. local time, which is a 12:30 a.m. Saturday morning tip on Eastern Time. Davis hopes for a similar outcome to the 2016-17 season when he was an assistant to North Carolina coach Roy Williams. The Tar Heels won 83-68 at Hawaii that year before rolling to the Maui Invitational crown and ultimately winning the program's sixth national championship. The 2024-25 Tar Heels again harbor aspirations of cutting down the nets both in Maui and at the Final Four with a roster built around All-American RJ Davis and freshman phenom turned standout sophomore Elliot Cadeau. The backcourt tandem paces an explosive offense that has produced at least 89 points in each of its first three games. Hawaii (4-0), meanwhile, has yet to allow more than 69 points in any of its first four outings. The Warriors feature a new-look lineup compared to a season ago when they won 20 games for a second consecutive campaign. The group is not lacking for experience, however. Big man Tanner Christensen, averaging a team-leading 17.5 points per game along with 6.5 rebounds, came to Hawaii from Utah Tech and Idaho, with 93 career starts. Christensen was named Big West Conference Player of the Week on Monday following a 25-point performance in Sunday's 73-68 overtime win versus Weber State. Christensen's frontcourt mate, Gytis Nemeiksa, played significant minutes last season at Xavier. He is averaging 11.3 points and a team-high 6.8 rebounds per game this season. Their strong interior play is a shift from coach Eran Ganot's previous teams that at times relied on 3-point shooting. Hawaii is shooting 51.4 percent overall but just 27.8 percent from deep. ""I know people can easily say teams or players live and die by the (3-pointer) just because it's an easy way to go to, but that's never been us,"" Ganot told the ""Marching to Madness"" podcast this week. ""I'm encouraged that we can find ways to have some success, especially late in games."" The Rainbow Warriors limited Weber State to 22.2 percent shooting (4 of 18) from behind the arc. None of their first four opponents made more than six 3-pointers. Solving the Hawaii defense is part of the overall learning experience Davis said he hopes North Carolina takes away from its visit to the islands. ""We've shown signs of playing great defense and being efficient on the offensive side end. It's about starting there and staying at that level,"" the coach said. ""Those are things not just about the next week or week-and-a-half, but for the whole year."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Bears are vying to keep those good vibes going into their next Big 12 test at Houston on Saturday.   Baylor (6-4, 4-3 Big 12) outgunned West Virginia 49-35 last week to continue its turnaround from a 2-4 start. That same day, a school spokesperson said Aranda -- whose Bears went 6-7 and 3-9 in the two seasons since winning the 2021 Big 12 title and the Sugar Bowl -- will return next season.   ""I feel like they've had my back the whole way,"" Aranda said Monday of the endorsement.   Sawyer Robertson threw for a career-high 329 yards and three touchdowns against West Virginia. Bryson Washington racked up 123 rushing yards, five receptions for 59 yards and four total touchdowns -- his second straight game with four.   ""There's some good energy and confidence right now with the team,"" Aranda said. ""For sure, they see the challenge ahead with a really strong Houston team, I want to say defensively particularly. Their front is probably the best that we've played or that we're gonna play.""   Averaging 45.8 points per game during its winning streak, the Bears are trying to tighten things up defensively. They've allowed a hefty 33 points per game in the same stretch.  But the Bears might get a breather with Houston ranked second-to-last in the FBS in scoring at 14.0 points per game.   The Cougars (4-6, 3-4) fell 27-3 to Arizona last Friday and now must win out to become bowl-eligible. That means beating both Baylor and BYU, which is No. 14 in the College Football Playoff rankings after losing to Kansas. ""I don't talk about it much,"" Houston coach Willie Fritz said. ""I just want to play as good as we can against Baylor. That's all I'm worried about. ... This is a really good team that's on a good roll right now. They're playing excellent on offense.""   To illustrate the struggles of Houston's passing game, Zeon Chriss' 191 passing yards in the loss to Arizona marked the Cougars' second-best team total since Sept. 14. On three occasions, Houston has failed to hit 100 passing yards.   Baylor and Houston played last year for the first time since 1995. Houston won on the road, 25-24, after converting a two-point conversion on its first possession of overtime.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

When the Razorbacks avoid turnovers and sacks, they win. When opponents make them cough up the ball and get to quarterback Taylen Green, as Texas did last week in a 20-10 decision, Arkansas loses. At 5-5 and needing a win to become bowl-eligible, the Razorbacks seek the mistake-free version of themselves Saturday in Fayetteville when Louisiana Tech visits for a non-conference contest. Arkansas has allowed 20 sacks in four Southeastern Conference losses, including six last week. It also gave up a pair of crushing turnovers, including a fumble by freshman CJ Brown after his first career catch deep in Texas territory with 6:55 left. The Razorbacks never saw the ball again. ""That's kind of been the story of all our losses and all our wins, you know, depending on what we do with turnovers,"" Arkansas coach Sam Pittman said. Green has thrown for 2,363 yards and 11 touchdowns but has also tossed eight interceptions and hung on to the ball too long at times. ""That's one thing in my game that I have to be better at,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Bulldogs (4-6) kept their bowl hopes alive with a 12-7 Conference USA win at Western Kentucky, which was 5-0 in the league. Buck Buchanan hit four field goals for Louisiana Tech and the defense held the high-powered Hilltoppers to just 215 total yards. Third-year coach Sonny Cumbie said his team persevered after enduring adversity most of the season. ""I talked to our team about being uncommon,"" he said. ""They have an uncommon fight and grit. You see the belief they have in each other, that is the most important thing."" The Bulldogs average just 112.2 yards per game on the ground but surprised Western Kentucky by coming up with 209 in 49 attempts, including 103 from Amani Givens.

And in a season that began with the Red Raiders and Cowboys plotting a big impact in the new-look Big 12 Conference, they're both surprised to be here. But that's the backdrop when they meet after notable missteps by the Red Raiders. The season has been unraveling for most of the last two months for the Cowboys. Neither team is in contention for the conference championship game with two weeks to go.  Texas Tech (6-4, 4-3) has dropped three of its last four league games after a promising start. Oklahoma State (3-7, 0-7) is pushing to the finish of its worst season since coach Mike Gundy's debut in 2005. ""I'm as frustrated as anybody else,"" said Red Raiders coach Joey McGuire, who has guided his team to a third straight bowl-eligible season in his third season. ""It's frustrating to me the opportunities that we've let get away because we haven't been good enough on game day."" Gundy can certainly relate. The Cowboys finish with a losing record for just the second time in his 20-year tenure and an 18-year bowl game streak won't make it to 19.  Ranked in the preseason Top 25, Oklahoma State began the season 3-0 with a solid victory against Arkansas but a wave of injuries has yielded seven losses in a row - four by 21 points or more.  The Cowboys lost defensive starters Collin Olliver, Nick Martin and Cameron Epps to season-ending injuries. They head into Saturday ranked last in the Big 12 in total defense, allowing just a tick under 500 yards a game, and next-to-last in scoring defense with foes averaging 31.9 points.  Texas Tech is the only team that has given up more points: 35.1 per game. The Red Raiders have been effective with the ball in their hands. They rank second in the league with 441 yards per contest and are the Big 12's highest-scoring offense at 35.5 points a game. So the challenge is daunting for the Cowboys, who hit mid-November playing out the string for the first time since Gundy took over. But Gundy expects his team's effort to be at the same level the program has expected since he grabbed the reins at his alma mater and built one of the most consistent programs in the Big 12. ""It's competition, same thing that I would say each week, and that when these guys walk on campus, they should be committed to themselves and to the team and then to whoever helped get them here and their family, or whoever raised them and put a lot into them,"" Gundy said. ""The most important thing that they can do is continue to train and work and stay together and compete, which they have."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Wisconsin coach Luke Fickell wasn't expecting to fire the Badgers' play-caller.   But that's the situation as Fickell's Badgers get ready to meet the Cornhuskers on Saturday afternoon in Lincoln, Neb.   Fickell dismissed offensive coordinator Phil Longo on Sunday, the day after Wisconsin lost to No. 1 Oregon 16-13 in Madison, Wis. The Badgers (5-5, 3-4 Big Ten) led 13-6 with 4:43 left in the third quarter, but produced only 21 yards on four possessions -- punt, punt, downs, interception -- in the fourth quarter and failed to add to the lead.   Oregon scored a tying touchdown and kicked a game-winning field goal with 2:36 to play.   As much as Fickell didn't sound interested in talking about Longo's departure, it was a prime topic. He emphasized that it was time for the program to ""move forward.""   ""It's not about play calls, it's not about points scored, it's not about touchdowns. It's moving forward with leadership, and that's, to me, what we have to do and why we're doing it right now,"" said Fickell, who is in his third year at Wisconsin and brought in before Longo last season.   The Badgers are averaging 23.9 points per game and have lost three games in a row while scoring 36 total points.   They've also played most of the season with backup quarterback Braedyn Locke running the offense. Starter Tyler Van Dyke went down with a knee injury in Week 3 against Alabama. Locke has been inconsistent at best, completing 55 percent of his passes for 1,514 yards. He has an equal number of interceptions as touchdowns (9).   Then there's Holgorsen, a head coach for 13 seasons who most recently ran the show at Houston from 2019-23. Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule brought Holgorsen in during the Cornhuskers' bye week to get his thoughts about the offense.   ""(Rhule) said, 'Just come try to figure this out, I need your help.' I was grateful to him for saying, 'I need your help,' I think a great deal of him. I think a great deal of this program, so I was excited to jump on it,"" Holgorsen said.   Apparently impressed with the newcomer's perspective, Rhule installed him as offensive coordinator. His predecessor, Marcus Satterfield, is working as tight ends coach.   Holgorsen's debut couldn't prevent the Cornhuskers (5-5, 2-5) from losing their fourth straight game, 28-20, at Southern California. The hosts led 21-20 before extending their lead with 2:09 to play.   Freshman quarterback Dylan Raiola then led Nebraska on a 13-play, 56-yard drive. On first-and-15 at the USC 19 with five seconds left, Raiola was picked off in the endzone.   ""We left a lot out there offensively,"" Rhule said. ""The offense is at some point here going to really take off with the kind of direction we're headed.""   The Cornhuskers are averaging 23.2 points per game.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Can they find","Disappointments and down seasons are nothing new for the Cleveland Browns, but the team’s current state feels uniquely grim. A sense of permanence surrounds the franchise's struggles, exacerbated by the acquisition of quarterback Deshaun Watson. His fully guaranteed contract has become an anchor weighing down the organization, with no feasible escape in sight. Watson has shown flashes of potential in his three seasons with Cleveland, but for the most part, his tenure has been a sobering reminder of the team’s bleak outlook. With a championship-caliber defense, there was hope last season that head coach Kevin Stefanski and general manager Andrew Berry had found a path forward. That optimism spiked after the late-season signing of veteran Joe Flacco, who came out of retirement to deliver a surprisingly strong December. Flacco reinvigorated the offense, which at times looked unstoppable. But the momentum fizzled when offseason decisions were made. The Browns opted for continuity, betting on a healthy Watson to return to form after his season-ending surgery. Instead, Cleveland has been plagued by injuries on the offensive line, a punchless running game without Nick Chubb, and a passing attack hampered by Watson’s inconsistency. Watson’s inability to find Amari Cooper—or anyone else for that matter—has left the Browns’ offense lifeless. Cooper might as well be Alice Cooper, Michael Cooper, or even Mark Cooper from Hangin’ with Mr. Cooper. The results have been that disappointing. In October, Watson suffered another season-ending injury, leaving Cleveland with a 1-6 record under his leadership and little reason for optimism. The quarterback, once heralded for his elite skills, now resembles a rusted-out Chevette after too many rebuilds. Oddly enough, Watson’s absence seemed to relieve some of the offense’s pressure. Stefanski no longer had to claim Watson gave the Browns the best chance to win. The team responded by shocking the Baltimore Ravens in one of the season’s most unexpected upsets. But the magic Stefanski found with Flacco is long gone. Jameis Winston, now at the helm, is playing with purpose, but he’s steering a makeshift operation. Even the team’s own personnel seem to lack faith in the Browns’ chances. The weight holding Cleveland back remains Watson’s guaranteed contract. The financial commitment is a burden the Browns can’t escape without hamstringing the franchise for years. Berry may publicly express confidence in Watson’s ability to rebound, but it’s hard to believe he sees the quarterback as capable of leading Cleveland to consecutive wins, let alone an AFC North title. Berry’s fingerprints are all over this roster, and until the Watson problem is resolved, the Browns are stuck paddling a sinking ship, knowing no amount of effort can deliver real progress.

Journalist Matt Shea was set to interview Paul in Puerto Rico for BBC’s new documentary, “Logan Paul: Bad Influence?” which claims to have new evidence regarding accusations that Paul promoted shady cryptocurrency projects without disclosing that he had a stake in them, resulting in massive paychecks.  Shea finally got his chance to interview Paul at his gym. At least he thought. Instead, when he arrived, he was met by a well-known imposter, Rodney Petersen, who does look a little bit like Paul. Petersen sat down for the interview and acted exactly like Paul. Shea asked the lookalike several questions before calling out that it wasn't Paul, including what it feels like to be one of the most famous people in the world. “I have to say, the real Logan Paul looks very different,” Shea interrupted, visibly irritated. Shea refused to proceed with the interview, as Petersen insisted on keeping the prank going for a little bit longer. “You came all the way to Puerto Rico from England. This is your interview. What do you got?” Shea still refused, and as he was about to get up out of his chair, a few “protestors” began repeatedly chanting anti-BBC remarks in reference to Huw Edwards, a former newscaster who was charged with three counts of making indecent images of children. The full clip on Paul's YouTube channel is quite the watch, and you could tell that Shea was completely mind-blown over the stunt. Shea maintains that this was childish behavior from Paul. And while that might be somewhat true, what in the world did he actually expect?  The title of the documentary literally references exposing Paul, so why on Earth would he ever help him with that or be a part of a hit piece against him?  To maintain his innocence? According to a source, the allegations that the BBC presented Paul and his team with were a regurgitation of claims he has already denied. Paul explains in his YouTube video that it's infuriating for a network with such a checkered past to try and attack his character, business practices, ethics and morals in the way that they did when they’ve done so little to address their own wrongdoings and those of the individuals they employ. Paul laid out several instances where the BBC employed individuals that have been both accused and found guilty of pedophilia, possessing child pornography, harassment, assault and rape.  The ultimate get back? He donated $50,000 to the Inspiring Children Foundation, an organization that lifts up underprivileged youth.  Paul seems pretty convinced that he did nothing wrong in this entire situation. And to troll a major news outlet, he must be pretty confident in his innocence. This is a classic prank. Hit him with the lookalike Jim Halpert from The Office. There’s nothing to be mad about here. Chalk it up to the game. Copyright 2024"

After that 1991 game, the teams split four neutral-site games -- including Duke beating the Wildcats in the 2000-01 national championship game -- before Arizona defeated the Blue Devils 78-73 last season at Durham, N.C. Arizona has a 6-4 edge in the series that dates to 1961. ""Friday sets up to be an epic night for early-season college basketball,"" Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd said. Duke coach Jon Scheyer, who played for Krzyzewski with the Blue Devils, said he had Arizona among his three finalists when he was recruited by Olson in 2001. He was in the stands in Minneapolis when Duke beat Arizona in the national title game. ""I remember being at that game and wanting to play games like that -- and then Lute Olson recruited me,"" Scheyer said. ""Arizona was one of my final three schools. So, personally, I have a lot of respect for Arizona, the program that they have, and Tommy."" Friday's game, completing the home-and-home arrangement, pits the Blue Devils (3-1) with freshman Cooper Flagg, projected to be the No. 1 overall pick in the next NBA draft, against the Wildcats (2-1). Arizona is led by preseason All-American fifth-year guard Caleb Love. Love has a personal rivalry with Duke, having played three years at North Carolina before transferring to Arizona last season. He scored 28 points when North Carolina eliminated Duke in the 2022 Final Four. Love's performance in a 103-88 loss last Friday at Wisconsin mirrored that of the Wildcats' struggles, scoring only six points on 2-of-13 shooting from the field before fouling out with 4:57 left. The Wildcats never led and their perimeter defense allowed Wisconsin 12 shots from 3-point range. John Tonje burned Arizona with 41 points. ""I'm not interested in going undefeated, not at all,"" Lloyd said. ""Our program's ready to take the next step and I'm ready to lead the charge. We've got to coach better. We've got to play better. ""We're going to go back, take a breath, get home, and, and we're excited for the opportunity we got (against Duke)."" Duke had the opportunity to reset itself after losing to Kentucky 77-72 at Atlanta on Nov. 12. The Blue Devils defeated Wofford 86-35 at home last weekend. Tyrese Proctor led a balanced scoring effort with 15 points. Flagg had nine rebounds with eight points, six assists, three steals and two blocked shots. ""A great bounce-back game,"" Scheyer said. ""I am really proud of how we shared the ball (season-high 24 assists on 30 made field goals). We've talked a lot about the process of the season, how no matter what, win or lose, how you respond is really important."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The 23-year-old Togo international is signed as a designated player through 2028 with an option for 2029. ""We're thrilled to welcome Kevin to FC Cincinnati,"" general manager Chris Albright said. ""He is a talented, young striker with exceptional character. Kevin has been one of the most productive forwards in Europe over the last two years, showcasing elite physicality, finishing ability and work ethic.

No. 20 Arkansas accomplished the feat during Monday's 91-72 home win against Pacific and will try to maintain the intensity during Friday night's game in Fayetteville, Ark., against in-state foe Little Rock. Arkansas (3-1) scored 25 of the game's final 36 points to pull away from Pacific and win consecutive games for the first time this season. ""I mean, we trust our defense,"" Boogie Fland said. ""... So (we're) just staying disciplined and making adjustments throughout the game."" Injuries to frontcourt veterans Trevon Brazile and Jonas Aidoo presented a challenge to the Razorbacks' depth. Only seven Arkansas players saw action, logging between 22 and 35 minutes. While the team's frenetic style took a toll on the Tigers, the Razorbacks ultimately felt just fine. Arkansas shot 59.6 percent from the field and produced four scorers in double figures. Adou Thiero led the way with 23 points and matched Johnell Davis for the team high with six rebounds. ""We just wanted to come out and have fun and show our grit on defense and just let that carry us,"" Thiero said. ""Offensively we were just trying to let the game come to us and find each other open shots."" The Razorbacks hope to spread the wealth not only in the flow of the game, but within the rotation as they await the return of Brazile and Aidoo. ""You're trying to have fun. You want those guys back so they can get some time,"" Fland said. ""It's a team sport and just everybody doing it together because we love each other. We're wishing they come back faster and going with the flow."" Little Rock improved to 2-2 on a six-game road trip with Wednesday's 71-57 victory at Tulsa. The Trojans (3-2) outscored the Golden Hurricane 51-32 after halftime, shooting a blazing 19-for-27 (70.4 percent) from the floor after the break. Little Rock forced Tulsa into 33.3 percent shooting after halftime, including 4 of 20 from long range, heeding the guidance of its coach, Darrell Walker. ""Coach just told us at halftime to be aggressive and keep boxing out and guard our tails off,"" said Jonathan Lawson, who scored 16 of his game-high 23 points down the stretch in the second half. Lawson added seven rebounds and five assists. Isaiah Lewis scored 17 points, Mwani Wilkinson had 16 points and nine rebounds, and Ante Beljan had 11 points. Trojans reserve Creed Williamson missed the game with an injury. Should he play Friday, it will mark a chance to suit up against his dad's alma mater. Nicknamed ""Big Nasty,"" Corliss Williamson was a two-time All-American at Arkansas and earned Final Four Most Outstanding Player in 1994 while helping the Razorbacks win the program's first national championship. Arkansas has limited its past two opponents, Troy and Pacific, to 38.2 and 40 percent shooting from the field, respectively.

Gators coach Todd Golden would prefer for his team to play a full 40 minutes, though, starting with Friday night's home game against Southern Illinois in Gainesville, Fla. Florida (5-0) led 46-22 at halftime and appeared to be on its way to a 40- or 50-point stomping of the Rattlers. But the Gators shot only 34 percent from the field in the second half and sent the visitors to the foul line 19 times. It is little wonder that Golden wasn't thrilled with how his team closed the game. ""Our expectation is to be able to play two complete halves, a full 40 minutes,"" he said. ""I thought we played 20 really good minutes into the first half and we were just OK in the second ... a lot to improve on. ""We allowed (missed shots) to affect our defense a little bit in the second half, and we fouled way too much on the defensive end. I just thought in the second half we let our foot off the gas."" The Gators haven't played a demanding schedule but have taken care of business, outscoring opponents by an average of nearly 20 points per game. They've scored at least 81 points in every contest. Five players are averaging double figures in points for Florida, led by guard Walter Clayton Jr. at 18.4 per game. Will Richard (15), Florida Atlantic transfer Alijah Martin (13.6), Alex Condon (12.2) and Chattanooga transfer Sam Alexis (10) also are consistent offensive threats. If there's a weakness in the Gators' attack, it's 3-point shooting, which stands at 28.9 percent for the season. But Richard and Martin, each of whom are under 27 percent, have proved capable from the arc during their careers. While Florida looks to play 40 consistent minutes, the Salukis (2-2) will try to carry the form from Monday night's 69-44 rout of North Dakota State into the first of four straight games away from Carbondale. They held the high-scoring Bison to 26.5 percent shooting from the field, including 5 of 27 from the 3-point line. First-year Southern Illinois coach Scott Nagy, who has won 579 games in a 30-year career that's included stops at South Dakota State and Wright State, said the week away from home will be beneficial to his squad. After the game at Florida, Southern Illinois will journey to a three-game, three-day tournament in Estero, Fla. ""We're one of the harder teams to prepare for because we don't run many sets,"" Nagy said. ""Can we focus on the next game? I kind of like it because I think we play better when we give them less information."" Guard Elijah Elliott, a transfer from Texas Rio Grande Valley, leads the Salukis with an average of 16.5 points per game on 55.3 percent shooting.

It won't be an easy task against a Houston program that has consistently been among the nation's best in the Kelvin Sampson era. The Cougars rank in the top five nationally in both offensive and defensive rating in the kenpom.com stats as they've started 2-1, with their loss coming to an Auburn team that also ranks top five in both metrics.  ""We have another great opportunity Friday night,"" Claxton said. ""We're not going to sneak up on them. I know Sampson is going to have them ready to go out there and compete and play hard, but we're going to do the same thing."" Houston's wins have come in dominant fashion. The Cougars beat Jackson State 97-40 in their season opener and enter Friday's game after a 91-45 win Wednesday over Louisiana, with the 74-69 loss to then-No. 11 Auburn sandwiched in between. The Cougars again are a deep team, with seven players averaging at least eight points per game. Three different players have led the team in scoring in each of the first three games.  ""The thing that we've always been good at here is bringing our team along,"" Sampson said. ""We're not trying to be the best team in the country on November the 5th, or 10th. Or come out breathing fire and not have a slow start. That's all part of the process. When you win by (that much), it's because of defense."" Houston's engine to this point has been Milos Uzan, who is averaging 10.3 points and a team-high 6.3 assists per game. Uzan also has been a factor on defense with an average of 2 steals per game. J'Wan Roberts and L.J. Cryer average a team-best 12.3 points per game.  Claxton is looking to take Hofstra (4-1) to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since back-to-back berths in 2000 and 2001, when Jay Wright coached the Pride.  Claxton, the point guard on the 2000 tournament team, has led Hofstra to 20-plus wins in his first three seasons on the sideline. The Pride enter Friday's game coming off their first loss of the season, 79-61 against Florida State.  Hofstra beat Iona by 14 and UMass in overtime by four, with a 49-48 win over Seton Hall in the middle. They also won their season opener 89-62 over Division III foe SUNY Old Westbury.  Iona transfer Jean Aranguren leads Hofstra in all three major statistical categories, averaging 18 points, 6.8 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. He nearly notched a triple-double in Hofstra's 14-point win over his former team, scoring 18 points while tallying nine rebounds and nine assists.  Claxton and Hofstra aren't strangers to the environment in Houston, either. The Pride took a then-No. 15 Houston team to overtime in Claxton's first game as head coach, losing 83-75 in the 2021-22 season.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Welcome to an election year, folks. Six NFL teams will go at it on Thanksgiving, with the Detroit Lions hosting the Chicago Bears, the New York Giants visiting the Dallas Cowboys and the Miami Dolphins hitting the road to face the Green Bay Packers. This isn’t Christmas, but allow us to put on our cap and nightgown like Ebenezer Scrooge once did so that we can take a trip back to the past to relive some of Turkey Day’s best games. Someone should have suggested putting a body on Randy Moss, no? Moss finished with only three catches—they just all happened to be touchdowns of at least 51 yards for a grand total of 163 yards on the day. The only question is, what type of disastrous performance does Dallas have in store for us this year? Six passing touchdowns. Count ‘em. Six. That’s how many Indianapolis signal-caller Peyton Manning had against the Lions to match a Thanksgiving Day record. However, he wasn’t necessarily spreading out the wealth, as three of those scores went to Marvin Harrison and the other three went to Brandon Stokley. Making the performance that much more impressive was the fact that Manning had all of his TD passes in the first three quarters. Surprisingly, Detroit outgained the Colts 386-356. Tom Brady threw for 323 yards and three touchdowns while rushing for a fourth, but it was New York quarterback Mark Sanchez who stole the spotlight—for all the wrong reasons. Early in the second quarter, Sanchez tried to scramble on a busted play and failed miserably, running into his own offensive line. The ball came free when Sanchez collided with Brandon Moore, and thus the “butt fumble” was born.  New England scooped up the ball and scored on the play, adding insult to injury. Bad day to be a Jets fan. Before there was Manning, there was Miami’s Bob Griese. Griese was the first one to throw for six touchdowns on Thanksgiving, and he helped the Dolphins hang 55 points, a record for the holiday at the time. Plenty of quarterbacks have come and gone for Miami since Griese was under center. Tua Tagovailoa is now the guy, and six TD passes is never out of the question with playmakers like Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle and De’Von Achane alongside him. No game on Thanksgiving had ever gone to overtime until this one, but fans didn’t end up getting all that much extra football. Dave Williams found the end zone on a 95-yard return on the opening kickoff of OT, with his fellow Bears rushing out onto the gridiron as he reached midfield during the play. Chicago had trailed 17-3 in the third quarter. Don’t be expecting the Bears to pull off big plays like this nowadays, though.   Copyright 2024"

John Blackwell led Wisconsin with 30 points, and John Tonje, coming off a 41-point effort over Arizona, scored 19.

I think we all kinda knew the issue that had just happened and how we had to fix it."" UCF has been in some battles to reach 4-0, coming in off an 80-69 home win over Tennessee Tech on Tuesday.  Keyshawn Hall led UCF with 20 points and eight rebounds. Jordan Ivy-Curry added 15 points and Dallan ""Deebo"" Coleman scored 14. Darius Johnson also joined the 1,000-point club with his six points, the first Knights player to reach the milestone since Tacko Fall (2019). ""When we build the lead, we have to learn how to sustain and build on it,"" UCF coach Johnny Dawkins said. ""Our guys played with a lot of poise down the stretch and gave us a chance to win the game."" Dawkins continued: ""I thought Deebo was terrific; he gave us a huge lift, especially in the first half. His leadership showed the whole game. He's a senior and he's already accomplished in college. He provided that for us, and I was happy to see him knock those shots down tonight."" Before the Tennessee Tech game, the Knights beat then-No. 13 Texas A&M by three in the season opener, Purdue Fort Wayne by seven, and Florida Atlantic by six.

The 6-foot-6 sharpshooter tied an NBA rookie record with nine made baskets from beyond the arc in Tuesday's 124-118 victory over the visiting Utah Jazz.  Not only did Knecht go 9 of 12 (75 percent) from long distance Tuesday, he is 21 of 31 (67.8 percent) over the past four games. He also has proved to be exactly the shooter the Lakers were seeking to partner with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. ""I just caught fire, and I just kept letting everything fly,"" Knecht said on Spectrum SportsNet. ""My teammates kept looking for me and running plays. Shout-out to them and (coach) JJ (Redick) for letting me go out there and keep letting that thing fly."" Knecht's shooting spree coincides with the Lakers' six-game winning streak. Los Angeles also is 7-0 at home this season and is one of three teams that has yet to lose in its own building, along with Cleveland and Orlando. While Davis leads the Lakers with averages of 30.7 points and 11.4 rebounds a game, Knecht's career-best 37 points Tuesday boosted his per-game average to 11.3 points on the season and 24.3 over his last four games. ""It's special to watch; it's fun,"" James said of Knecht's performance. ""... When a guy gets hot like that, you feel like you can throw anything into the ocean. It's going in for sure."" The Magic will play in the Los Angeles area for the second time in two nights after dropping a 104-93 decision against the host Clippers on Wednesday.

Orlando held its opponents under 100 points in every game of the winning run before the Clippers eclipsed the century mark. Second-year guard Anthony Black is starting to come into his own, with five double-digit scoring games in his last eight contests. He had a team-best 17 points Wednesday and a season-high 20 in a 109-99 road victory over the Phoenix Suns on Monday. Black averaged 4.6 points last season, is up to 9.0 this season and has averaged 11.3 points in his last eight games. He also has 17 assists over his last two games. ""From a year ago to now, his maturity has gone to a different level,"" Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said of Black. ""... Where he can go, I think it's just gonna be continued leadership and vocal presence on the court with this group, and just continue to command the floor."" Franz Wagner, the most recent Eastern Conference Player of the Week, leads Orlando with 22.3 points per game while Jalen Suggs is averaging 15. Without an average of 8.8 rebounds from both Banchero (five games) and Wendell Carter Jr. (six), Goga Bitadze leads the Magic with 6.4 per game. Carter missed his ninth consecutive game for the Magic with a left foot injury but has a chance of returning against the Lakers.

The losses haven't been within a touchdown for Las Vegas (2-8), save for a five-point setback to the Los Angeles Rams on Oct. 20 in which it trailed 20-6 before making three straight field goals to make the final score look a bit more competitive.  The Broncos (6-5), on the other hand, have been a pleasant surprise.  Expectations for Bo Nix's rookie year weren't exactly through the roof, but the outlook has changed with the quarterback's recent performance. Nix has thrown 2,275 yards so far this season in addition to 14 touchdowns. Over the past two games, Nix has 522 passing yards with six touchdowns and zero interceptions. ""It's hard to pick out specific things (that he's doing well),"" Broncos coach Sean Payton said. ""I mean, we're blocking well. I think we have balance. I say this all the time, your allies at that position are your defense. He's certainly settled in third down (and) red zone. ""You're learning each week and then pretty soon you're like, I belong here. It's clear (Nix) belongs here."" For Nix, his performance earned him his first career AFC Player of the Week honor.  ""It's a great honor,"" Nix said. ""It's a great responsibility, but at the same time, it doesn't end with just that. You obviously got to go back, continue, and they only remember your last game. You got to go out there and continue to do it. ""It's a great honor. Many great players have won the award in the past. It's an honor to be included and be that recipient, but there's a lot of work left to be done."" Las Vegas starter Gardner Minshew hasn't had the same success recently.  Minshew has just eight passing touchdowns and nine interceptions, and his tally of 1,783 yards for the season ranks a lackluster 24th overall among starting quarterbacks.  The Raiders' ground attack hasn't been much of a help either, as the team ranks last in the league with 75.2 rushing yards per game.  Las Vegas also is nursing several injuries, including a shoulder injury to cornerback Jakorian Bennett. He sustained the injury during the first quarter of the Raiders' 34-19 loss to the Miami Dolphins last Sunday. ""It's one of the ones you've got to just swallow, you've got to take it,"" Las Vegas coach Antonio Pierce said. ""There's been some non-contact injuries. There's been guys getting rolled up.

In the Sharks' 5-2 loss at Dallas on Wednesday, Granlund scored and set up a goal and Eklund added an assist. ""That line has been good, good chemistry,"" Warsofsky said. ""You can see they know each other in the offensive zone. They are doing some really good things. (Granlund) has taken both of those guys under his wing and helped them become really true pros now and take that next step."" The Sharks, who are 1-2-2 in their last five games, started Mackenzie Blackwood in goal Wednesday. With Vitek Vanecek sidelined on a day-to-day basis with an upper-body injury, Yaroslav Askarov arrived from the Sharks' American Hockey League in San Jose and served as Blackwood's backup Wednesday.  But Vanecek also made the trip, and Warsofsky remained undecided about who to start in goal Thursday against the Blues. Forward Brayden Schenn and defenseman Justin Faulk didn't participate in practice for the Blues on Wednesday. Bannister termed it a ""maintenance day"" for both and said he expects them to play against the Sharks. Defenseman Pierre-Olivier Joseph practiced again Wednesday while continuing his comeback from a lower-body injury. Bannister was unsure if he would rejoin the lineup on Thursday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Devils will look to regain a share of the division lead and cool off the Hurricanes on Thursday night when the teams clash in Newark, N.J. The Devils have been idle since Saturday when they dropped a 4-0 decision to the host Tampa Bay Lightning.  The Hurricanes, in turn, will be completing a back-to-back road set after scoring three third-period goals Wednesday in a 4-1 win over the Philadelphia Flyers. The first quarter of the season has been a successful one for New Jersey, which is 12-7-2 under first-year head coach Sheldon Keefe. But the busy schedule has the Devils already trying to make up ground against the Hurricanes and Capitals, each of whom have three games in hand. The Capitals leapfrogged the Devils on Monday by recording a 6-2 victory over the Utah Hockey Club. Carolina seized sole possession of first place on Wednesday.  Keefe said he's hopeful the break will refresh the Devils, who are one point ahead of the fourth-place New York Rangers. The Rangers, however, have four games in hand.  ""The demands of the schedule being what it has been in the first 20 games of the season -- it's been a lot for us and the pace that's been more demanding than the rest of the league, quite frankly,"" Keefe said following practice Tuesday. ""Chance now to sort of take a breath."" The Hurricanes haven't allowed opponents much room to breathe during a three-game winning streak in which they've outscored the Flyers, Ottawa Senators and St. Louis Blues by a combined 12-2 margin. Carolina got off to a quick start Wednesday, when Jalen Chatfield scored on the team's second shot of the game just 30 seconds after the opening faceoff. But the Hurricanes didn't score again until Sebastian Aho collected the game-winner 1:03 into the third period. ""(The key is) restarting every night. Even (Thursday), we've got to take what we can learn from this game, the good and the bad, and get right back at it (on Thursday),"" Chatfield said. ""We can't be focusing on the past, ever, and we know we've got an experienced group, we've got a lot of good leaders and we try to bring it every night. Some nights it doesn't start the best, but we always find our game and once we do that, we're fine."" Following Aho's goal, Jordan Staal and Jack Roslovic scored within a 55-second span for the Hurricanes, who outshot the Flyers 20-15 in the first two periods before enjoying a 17-4 advantage in the third. ""I liked how we answered in the third -- I thought the game was there and now we've got to make a statement because I don't love the first two periods, that's for sure,"" Hurricanes coach Rod Brind'Amour said after his team defeated the Flyers. ""But again, you've got the other team and they're doing their thing. But I thought it was a good collective effort in the third."" Carolina has scored 72 goals this season, tied for second in the Eastern Conference. The Hurricanes have put up at least four goals in 12 of the past 13 games (11-2-0). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The 3-0 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday dropped Vegas to just 3-4-2 on the road this season. It also marked the first time the Golden Knights were shut out since last season at Colorado (Jan. 10). That loss came on the heels of a 5-2 setback to the Washington Capitals on Sunday. Vegas also lost to the Capitals on Oct. 15, a defeat that started a three-game losing skid (0-2-1). The Golden Knights entered Wednesday's setback converting on 35 percent of their road power plays, tops in the NHL, but went 0-for-3 with the extra man in Toronto.  ""Yeah, frustrating,"" said forward Jack Eichel, who had a six-game point streak snapped in the shutout loss. ""Obviously had some power-play opportunities, and our power play has helped us a lot this year but we weren't able to do that tonight. I think that was sort of the difference. It's frustrating. We need to find ways to score goals.""  Eichel was asked if the Golden Knights could benefit from a quick turnaround.  ""Yeah, obviously we're playing in like 20 hours,"" he replied. ""Just learn from the game but we need to be better. It's frustrating. You lose a few in a row and you don't want to let this continue to go. Obviously we need to find a way to get two points. It's as simple as that. We have a competitive group in here and we'll respond well.""  The Golden Knights will be facing an Ottawa team that also is smarting after a pair of lopsided losses. The Senators followed up a 5-4 overtime loss versus the Philadelphia Flyers last Thursday with a 4-0 setback at the Carolina Hurricanes on Saturday and a 5-2 defeat at home to the Edmonton Oilers on Tuesday.  The Senators fell behind 3-1 in the first period to the Oilers on a pair of goals by superstar Connor McDavid. They trailed 5-1 midway through the third period before Josh Norris tipped in a Nick Jensen point shot with just 2:24 remaining to close the scoring.  ""Flat,"" Ottawa coach Travis Green said of his team's effort. ""Not a lot of energy. Not sharp with our execution. We looked flat tonight. It's frustrating for sure.""  ""I think as a group, and I think myself as well, the first two periods are probably the worst two periods I've played,"" Senators defenseman Thomas Chabot said. ""You've got to take some ownership. Fortunately, in hockey you have a chance to go at it soon again."" Ottawa captain Brady Tkachuk said he expects his team to bounce back with a strong effort versus Vegas. ""No more (expletive) excuses,"" Tkachuk said. ""Right now every game is a must-win. These are the moments, the games that could turn a season around. We know we're a good team."" ""We know it's going to be a tough game against Vegas,"" forward Drake Batherson added. ""They know how to win. Obviously they won a (Stanley) Cup a few years ago so it will be a good one. Just got to be ready to ground it out."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The contest will tip off the Cal Classic, a week-long, four-team, round-robin affair that includes Sacramento State and Mercyhurst. Air Force (1-3) will be playing away from home for the first time. The Falcons beat Jacksonville State 73-67 in their second outing, but they were much more pleased with a competitive effort on Friday in a 79-71 loss to Belmont, an eight-time NCAA Tournament participant in the past 19 years. ""We played a really good team. Major progress,"" Air Force coach Joe Scott said. ""I don't want to sit in the locker room and say, 'We didn't play hard or we didn't ...' We looked like we're supposed to look. We played like we practiced. When that happens, you start to believe."" The Falcons have been led by the all-around play of Ethan Taylor, who is averaging 19.5 points, 8.0 rebounds and 4.5 assists. The senior has been on the court for 156 of a possible 160 minutes so far. Cal (3-1) has featured a much more balanced attack, with three players averaging in double figures and eight contributing at least 4.5 points per game. The Golden Bears received points and rebounds from eight players in a 71-66 victory at Southern California on Sunday, Cal's first nonconference road win in seven years. Andrej Stojakovic had 20 points and Jovan Blacksher Jr. 19 in the win, but coach Mark Madsen was most impressed with the team chemistry demonstrated by an entire roster of transfers playing together for just the fourth time.

The Hawks shot 38.5 percent from 3-point range against the Quakers, dominated the boards 43-26, and forced 13 turnovers while only committing 10 fouls.

However, he also has lamented Michigan's turnover problems (17.8 per game) and a lack of offensive rebounds for a roster he says is ""the sixth-biggest team in the country."" Most of all, May is still searching for an identity out of his team. ""I was speaking to a coaching friend -- a very, very successful coaching friend slash mentor -- and I told him that I don't feel like we have an identity yet on either side of the ball,"" May said. ""His response was, 'You're not supposed to. You're four games in. You have a new team, you have to win in the margins now, you have to figure this stuff out. You may not have an identity until conference play.'"" A roster with only three players back from last season, Michigan will try and continue to figure out its identity against Tarleton State, which is off to a 1-4 start. The Texans were picked to finish sixth in the Western Athletic Conference. ""We're going to keep fighting the good fight and keep getting better every day,"" May said. ""No team is going to be perfect this time of year. So once again, it comes down to can you fix your issues and solve your problems? If we're still doing this in January, February, then we haven't done a very good job as a staff."" Four Michigan players are averaging double-figure scoring in the early going: Tre Donaldson (14 points per game), Nimari Burnett (11.8), Danny Wolf (11.5) and Roddy Gayle Jr. (10.5).

""He's got to be in everybody's scouting report for transition,"" Moser said in a postgame interview Saturday. ""He runs so hard. He outruns you. If he gets ahead, it's going to be a great dunk.

The Cowboys (3-7) took their fifth straight loss on Monday night, falling 34-10 to the Houston Texans. After a one-point loss to the rugged Pittsburgh Steelers, followed by the compressed schedule that led into the Thursday night game at Philadelphia, the Commanders were able to rest and get healthy with the extra days. ""I was able to reset and refocus, restart,"" rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels said Wednesday. ""It's kind of needed in a long season like that. It was great to get away for a little bit, but I'm glad that we're back now."" The offense can use a reset. Daniels completed just 59.1 percent of his passes against the Steelers and Eagles with a touchdown and an interception. He posted two of his three lowest passer ratings of the season in those games. The Commanders are averaging 22.5 points over their past four games, more than a touchdown less than over the first seven games of the season (31.1). ""I don't think anyone is hitting the panic button, but at the same time there's a lot to improve on,"" Washington tight end Zach Ertz said. ""There's a lot of urgency that goes with that."" It will be a reunion of sorts for Commanders head coach Dan Quinn, who served as Dallas' defensive coordinator for the previous three seasons. The Cowboys went 2-0 against the Commanders last season but arrive in D.C. a double-digit underdog after losing five games by a combined 172-70. ""We have a lot of moving parts going on, and we just have to be cleaner and more detailed in certain spots,"" Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy said. ""We're not playing well enough, not executing well enough, coaching well enough to overcome some of the mistakes we're making in critical times of the game."" The Cowboys' minus-11 turnover differential is tied for second worst in the league. On defense, Dallas ranks sixth from the bottom in the NFL, allowing 365.7 yards per game, and second to last in points allowed (29.3). The Cowboys have also been troubled by slow starts. Dallas has produced the opening score in only three of its 10 games. Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush is expected to make his third consecutive start after throwing for 354 yards, one touchdown and one interception against Houston. ""We've got seven losses. We gotta go,"" McCarthy said. ""Backs against the wall. Gotta fight, claw, scratch. Gotta do everything we can to go win the next game. That's where my mind's at. That's the way we coach and that's the expectation. In terms of good news for Dallas, All-Pro cornerback DaRon Bland (foot) returned to practice and was a full participant on Wednesday.

Nevada plays at a plodding pace (321st nationally in KenPom's adjusted tempo at 17.6 seconds per possession).

McGlockton (10.0 rpg, 3.0 blocks per game) and reserve guard Tyler Tanner (3.0 steals per contest) have excelled on defense for Vanderbilt. The Commodores had a one-turnover game in their opening-night win over Maryland Eastern Shore, registered 18 steals in a win over Cal on Nov. 13 and went 16-for-38 on 3-point attempts in a 94-81 victory over Jackson State on Sunday.

Chicago's skid began when it lost on a Hail Mary pass against the Washington Commanders, and it turned four weeks old last Sunday when the Green Bay Packers blocked a 46-yard field-goal attempt by Bears kicker Cairo Santos as time expired. Bears coach Matt Eberflus tried to stay upbeat despite the mounting losses. ""There were a lot of positives to build from,"" he said. ""That's what you have to do."" Bears quarterback Caleb Williams will try to build upon a solid start as he prepares to face the Vikings for the first time in his young career. The rookie completed 23 of 31 passes for 231 yards last week against Green Bay, and he carried the ball nine times for 70 yards. Chicago wide receiver DJ Moore, who had a team-high seven catches for 62 yards last week, said he and his teammates should be able to maintain their positive momentum this week against the Vikings' top-10 defense. ""With all the players we've got, I hope we are able to move the ball on all types of defenses -- from the No. 1 defense in the league down to the 32nd,"" Moore said. ""I hope we can keep it up and hopefully get some wins out of it."" As the Bears look to stop a losing streak, the Vikings will aim to maintain their winning streak. Minnesota is coming off victories against the Indianapolis Colts, Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans over the past three weeks. Darnold has posted a 100.0 passer rating in 10 starts this season. He has completed a career-best 67.9 percent of his passes for 2,387 yards, 19 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. The next touchdown pass will mark a career high for Darnold, who sputtered with the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers before serving as the San Francisco 49ers' backup last season. ""I just feel like, you know -- not talking about past experiences at all -- but I think here it's the detail that we've had ever since OTAs, ever since April,"" Darnold said. ""We've been able to lock in our progressions. Just our feet, our eyes, where they're supposed to be. And just being on time with the concepts. ""If you play like that, it makes the quarterback position a little bit easier."" It also helps to have All-Pro wideout Justin Jefferson, who has 59 catches for 912 yards and five touchdowns. The Vikings' top rusher is former Packer Aaron Jones, who has 692 yards and a pair of touchdowns on the ground. The teams split their matchups last season. The Vikings won 19-13 in Chicago on Oct. 15, and the Bears responded with a 12-10 victory in Minneapolis on Nov. 27. Chicago is 4-2 at home this season. Minnesota is 4-1 on the road. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Atlanta went 12-of-46 from beyond the arc. Hield (11), Waters (10) and Jonathan Kuminga (10) also scored in double figures for the Warriors. Draymond Green added nine points, nine assists, seven rebounds and two blocks in the win. Jalen Johnson led a balanced attack with 15 points and added a game-high 14 rebounds for the Hawks, who had lost at Portland on Sunday and won at Sacramento on Monday to begin a four-game trip. Trae Young had 12 points and 11 assists and Zaccharie Risacher also scored 12 points in the loss. Clint Capela and Dyson Daniels had 11 points each and Hunter finished with 10 off the bench for the Hawks. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The NFC East-leading Eagles (8-2) have won their past six contests, while the Rams (5-5) have won four of their past five to keep pace in a crowded NFC West. Philadelphia enters Week 12 with the league's No. 1 defense, allowing 273.1 yards per game, and the No. 5 offense powered by Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley. Hurts has accounted for 23 touchdowns (12 passing, 11 rushing), and Barkley leads the NFL with 1,347 yards from scrimmage. The Eagles are well-rested, as they have been idle since a 26-18 win on Nov. 14 against division rival Washington. Philadelphia held the Commanders to 264 total yards -- the sixth straight game an opponent failed to gain more than 280 vs. the Eagles. Philadelphia is also road-tested. The Eagles are 4-1 in road games, which doesn't include their ""home"" win against Green Bay in Brazil to open the season. Road success is nothing new for the team, as the Eagles are 22-9 away from home in three-plus seasons under coach Nick Sirianni. ""I think the biggest thing out of all that is just having that mental toughness that everyone is going to be against you on the road,"" Sirianni said this week. ""Now, we travel pretty well, and I've been really appreciative of the Eagles fans that show up no matter where we are. But you still feel like the stadium is against you. ""It's just an opportunity for you to unite as a team, lock arms as a team and have that mental toughness, that dawg mentality as far as understanding just play the next play, control what you can control, and unite as a team. Those are two of our big-time core values: connect and toughness. So we take pride in that. Then I just think that speaks volumes of our players and coaches that they handle that."" The Eagles have won all three road games in the series since the Rams returned to Los Angeles in 2016, including a 23-14 victory in Week 5 last season. ""They (Eagles) are red hot,"" Rams coach Sean McVay said this week. ""They have played really well. They are finding their identity. They have great playmakers, coaches, and schemes. So they are checking all the boxes of what really good teams do. So, that is a great challenge. ... ""We have a lot of respect for this group. But you know, these are the moments that you love as a competitor. This is what is the best part of the NFL."" The Rams are 3-2 at home this season, losing by five to the Green Bay Packers in Week 5 and by eight to the Miami Dolphins in Week 10. Los Angeles rebounded from the defeat to the Dolphins with a 28-22 win at New England last weekend. Matthew Stafford threw for 295 yards and four touchdowns, with Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua combining for 13 receptions, 229 yards and three scores. Stafford has a 4-2 record in his career against the Eagles with 12 touchdown passes and one interception. The Eagles announced Wednesday that defensive end Bryce Huff would have wrist surgery and could go on injured reserve. The team also opened the practice window for wide receiver Britain Covey (shoulder). Hurts (ankle) was listed as limited at Wednesday's practice. Wideout DeVonta Smith (hamstring), defensive tackle Milton Williams (foot) and linebacker Jalyx Hunt (ankle) did not participate. For the Rams, starting right tackle Rob Havenstein (ankle) and cornerback Charles Woods (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday. Cornerback Cobie Durant (thigh), defensive tackle Neville Gallimore (neck) and offensive lineman Joe Noteboom (ankle) were limited. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

An average of 17.5 million viewers have tuned in to an NFL game this season, which does not count international games carried by NFL Network or other exclusive broadcasts streamed on ESPN+ and Peacock. The league reported it is the highest average viewership through Week 11 since the 2015 season. The increased ratings come after speculation that viewership might decline during the election season. That's what happened in 2016, when the ratings dipped 8 percent from the previous year, according to Front Office Sports. Viewership also fell across multiple sports leagues during the COVID-impacted 2020 election season. That changed this year, as ratings remained steady around the election window. Late Sunday afternoon games aired on CBS and Fox, along with primetime games shown on Amazon Prime Video, NBC and ESPN, averaged 18.48 million viewers in the two weeks before the Nov. 5 election, according to Nielsen data. That average fell slightly to 18.18 million viewers in the two weeks after Election Day. Week 11 featured the NFL's top-rated game so far this season, with the Buffalo Bills' 30-21 win over Kansas City, the Chiefs' first defeat of the year, drawing 31.2 million viewers. The two-time defending champion Chiefs have now played in four of the five most-watched games this season: --Chiefs vs. Bills, Week 11: 31.2 million viewers --Ravens vs. Chiefs, Week 1: 28 million --Bengals vs. Chiefs, Week 2: 27.9 million --Ravens vs. Cowboys, Week 3: 27.3 million --Chiefs vs. 49ers, Week 7: 27.1 million The NFL also drew its largest Week 11 ""Monday Night Football"" TV audience since 2006, as 17 million viewers tuned in for the Houston Texans' 34-10 win over the Dallas Cowboys. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Sellers, a transfer from Southern California, sank a 3-pointer to give the Cardinal a 63-58 lead with 2:34 to go. He subsequently made four consecutive free throws, and Stanford went up 67-60 with 35 seconds left. After Norfolk State's Sin'Cere McMahon made a 3-pointer with 29 seconds remaining, the Cardinal's Jaylen Blakes made two free throws to help seal the win. Stanford is 5-0 for the first time since starting 7-0 in the 2019-20 season. Blakes made 10 of 12 free-throw attempts and tied his career high with 18 points. Maxime Raynaud led the Cardinal with 20 points and 10 rebounds. Norfolk State (4-2) got 24 points from Brian Moore Jr., 17 from Christian Ings and 10 from Jalen Myers. Stanford scored 14 unanswered points to take a 14-2 lead five minutes into the game and never trailed thereafter. Blakes, a graduate transfer from Duke, scored the first seven points of that run. A 3-pointer by Ryan Agarwal gave Stanford a 30-15 lead, its largest of the game, with 8:25 left in the first half. Stanford went more than seven minutes without making a field goal, which allowed Norfolk State to cut the gap to 35-31 with 1:28 left in the half. The Cardinal missed eight consecutive shots from the field in that stretch. Stanford led 38-33 at halftime behind Raynaud's 12 points and six rebounds. The Cardinal again had a field-goal drought in the first five minutes of the second half, allowing Norfolk State to go on a 9-1 run and take a 42-40 lead with 14:54 left. Sellers snapped Stanford's 0-for-6 start from the field in the second half by making a jumper with 14:32 left. The basket ignited a 9-2 run that enabled the Cardinal to take a 49-44 lead with 8:52 remaining. Moore scored 10 straight points for Norfolk State to help cut the deficit to 60-58 with 2:50 left.

Four players scored in double figures for USC (4-1), which ended its last game with a lengthy scoring drought and sputtered out of the gate on Wednesday. The Trojans had only four points in the game's first 4:18 but came alive midway through the first half, going on a 7-0 run after trailing 18-16. USC never relinquished the lead, though San Jose State (1-5) remained close throughout the first half. The Spartans' Will McClendon, who finished with 18 points, scored coming out of halftime, to trim the deficit to five points. The Trojans' followed with their 10-0 and led by double digits the rest of the way. The Trojans dished at least 20 assists in each of their first three games before finishing with just 10 in Sunday's 71-66 loss to Cal. Wednesday marked a return to form, as Saint Thomas accounted for nine of the Trojans' to 23 assists on their 32 USC field goals. The Trojans shot 57.1 percent from the floor, including 10-of-22 from 3-point range. San Jose State was at 41.9 percent and 11-of-23 from beyond the arc. Josh Uduje made all five of his 3-point attempts en route to 25 points for the Spartans. But the Spartans made just 15 of 39 shots from inside the 3-point arc to USC's 22 of 34. The Trojans enjoyed a 38-26 edge in points in the paint thanks in part to Matt Knowling. Knowling shot 5-of-6 from the floor and collected 12 points, eight rebounds, five assists and two blocks.

Florida is 1-3-0 in its past four games, including its 6-3 road loss to the Winnipeg Jets on Tuesday. After two straight losses, the Panthers appeared to have things clicking again with their dominant 5-0 shutout of the Jets on Saturday. However, Winnipeg rebounded by scoring the first three goals in the rematch. The Panthers twice pulled within one goal, but they couldn't complete the comeback. ""Every time we felt we were getting closer there, (Winnipeg) just put one in and got the momentum right back,"" Florida forward Matthew Tkachuk said. ""It was an even game for the most part. It's tough to lose that one when you fight back to get close."" The Panthers now face the Blackhawks and their NHL-low 13 points. Chicago is 1-5-0 in its past six games and has lost three straight. The Blackhawks led the visiting Anaheim Ducks 2-1 through 45 minutes on Tuesday, but Chicago's late-game struggles emerged again. The Ducks scored the equalizer and go-ahead goal within a span of 4:28 in the third period. The Blackhawks have been outscored 26-15 in third periods this season. ""(It's) definitely frustrating,"" said Chicago forward Jason Dickinson, who scored twice against Anaheim. ""We've been in a lot of these games. We could easily be coming out of a lot of these with wins. ... At the end of the day, we've got to go out and do it."" Beyond just the late concessions, Dickinson noted that the Blackhawks are getting outscored in general. Chicago is last in the league in goals (44) and average goals per game (2.32). Connor Bedard leads the Blackhawks with 15 points (three goals, 12 assists), though the reigning Calder Trophy winner hasn't scored a goal in his past 10 games. Chicago also took a hit with its announcement Wednesday that top defenseman Seth Jones will miss four weeks after he suffered a right foot injury.  Jones, 30, was placed on injured reserve on Saturday. He may have been hurt while blocking a shot in Chicago's 3-1 loss to Seattle Kraken on Nov. 14, coach Luke Richardson told reporters on Wednesday. Jones -- who has 10 points (two goals, eight assists) in 17 games this season -- leads all Chicago skaters in ice time per game at 25:43.  Sam Reinhart leads the Panthers with 29 points and 14 goals, and is tied for the team lead with 15 assists. He's fourth in the league in points. Seventeen of Reinhart's points (nine goals, eight assists) have come during his current 11-game point streak. A point on Thursday would tie Reinhart for the fifth-longest points streak in Panthers franchise history. Aleksander Barkov has also amassed 17 points (three goals, 14 assists) over a nine-game point streak. Panthers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky followed up his 27-save shutout over the Jets by allowing four goals on 25 shots on Tuesday. Bobrovsky has a modest .895 save percentage and 3.00 goals against average over his past six starts, so Florida could give Bobrovsky a breather by starting backup goalie Spencer Knight against Chicago. Blackhawks goalie Petr Mrazek wasn't available to face Anaheim due to a personal matter, so backup Arvid Soderblom got the start. Soderblom will presumably start again Thursday if Mrazek is still absent, as the Blackhawks likely wouldn't have rookie backup Drew Commesso make his NHL debut against the high-powered Panthers offense. Florida is 12-4-1 in its past 17 games against Chicago, dating back to the 2018-19 season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But what about when a team is going good? The Arizona Cardinals (6-4), who have a one-game lead over the three other teams in the NFC West, had last week off in preparation for Sunday's divisional showdown at Seattle (5-5). ""When you're in a rhythm, you're playing good football as a team, you don't want to stop,"" Cardinals tight end Trey McBride said. ""We've won three or four in a row now and it's fun. You want to keep this thing going, you don't want to take this break."" For the record, the Cardinals have won four consecutive games, defeating the Los Angeles Chargers 17-15, Chicago Bears 29-9 and New York Jets 31-6 at home, and the Miami Dolphins 28-27 on the road. One of the keys for the Cardinals has been a healthy Kyler Murray. He completed 22 of 24 passes for 266 yards two weeks ago against the Jets and also rushed for two scores. ""He's got that look in his eye, and when he's in that mode, he's unstoppable,"" said McBride, who has a team-high 49 receptions. ""He's playing at a really high level right now. I'm excited for him and I'm excited to continue to grow with him."" Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon called Sunday's game a ""big-time test on the road."" ""Seattle is always loud and the weather is kind of gray,"" Gannon said. The Seahawks are coming off a 20-17 victory against host San Francisco last week as quarterback Geno Smith scrambled for a 13-yard touchdown with 12 seconds remaining. Seattle snapped a two-game skid and won for just the second time in seven games.  ""These are the most important games of your season,"" Smith said. ""I think the way that we came out and we fought, collectively as a unit and as a team, it just spoke to our urgency. I thought the way that we practiced all week, I knew we were going to come out and play well and get the monkey off my back."" Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said his team is treating Arizona's visit ""like a home playoff game for us."" ""Look, we've earned the opportunity to be fighting for the lead in the division going into the home stretch,"" Macdonald said. ""So, that's the way we're treating it. It's very much like a playoff mindset for us at this point. Can't afford to drop games. You want to have the right to play for these really important games in December and January. You've got to be able to execute and put yourself in that situation."" The Cardinals had just one player miss practice time this week, safety Jalen Thompson (ankle). Veteran right tackle Jonah Williams (knee) was activated off injured reserve after being out since the season opener. The Seahawks were without tight ends Noah Fant (groin) and Brady Russell (foot), wide receiver Laviska Shenault Jr. (back), defensive end Leonard Williams (foot) and cornerback Dee Wiliams (ankle) at practice. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Texans (7-4) hold a two-game division lead over the Indianapolis Colts despite recently losing three of four games, including blowing a 16-point halftime lead in a loss to the Detroit Lions. But Houston roared to a dominating 34-10 road victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Monday night, perhaps signaling the team is ready to go on a roll. In fact, the Texans visit a Jacksonville Jaguars team in disarray in Week 13 before having a bye week. Just don't mention the word ""playoffs"" anywhere near Texans coach DeMeco Ryans. ""I just want our guys to remain focused, remain locked in on the task at hand each week,"" Ryans told reporters. ""If we do that, we're a really good football team. We can play with anybody. It's just about finishing.""  Quarterback C.J. Stroud passed for 257 yards and was intercepted once against Dallas. Big-play receiver Nico Collins returned from a five-game absence due to a hamstring injury to catch four passes for 54 yards. But the big reason for the trampling of the Cowboys was running back Joe Mixon, who rushed for three touchdowns and had 153 yards from scrimmage. His 109 on the ground represented his fifth 100-yard outing in the past six games. ""When he's on, Joe's a force,"" Ryans said. ""I liked the way we just kept churning it in the run game. And I'm proud of the guys for stepping up to the challenge."" Houston expects to have star Will Anderson Jr. (ankle) after a two-game absence. Anderson, who was limited in Wednesday's practices, shares the team lead of 7.5 sacks with fellow defensive end Danielle Hunter. The Titans (2-8) lack an identity after the offseason departure of franchise icon Derrick Henry, the star running back. Tennessee has lost six games by double digits as it begins back-to-back road games against the Texans and Washington Commanders. Star defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons is putting on a brave face. He liked the effort in last Sunday's 23-13 loss to the Minnesota Vikings. ""The fight this team showed, especially in the second half, is why you want to play this game,"" Simmons said. ""No matter what the record may be, that's why I come to work, and I'm ready to go to war with my guys."" Quarterback Will Levis passed for a season-best 295 yards against the Vikings. One third of them came on one play when Nick Westbrook-Ikhine caught a pass at his own 40-yard line and raced down the right sideline for a 98-yard scoring play. Levis completed just 17 of 31 passes and was intercepted once. He isn't thrilled that Tennessee ranks 28th in the NFL in scoring offense (17 points per game) and 25th in total offense (295.4 yards per game). ""You have to just continue coming to work, knowing that how you approach your job and how you approach your day-to-day are the habits that create winning football,"" Levis said Wednesday. ""And, we just have to know that if we just keep doing those things, then the wins are going to come."" Titans standout cornerback L'Jarius Sneed (quadriceps) will not play on Sunday, according to coach Brian Callahan. He and receiver Calvin Ridley (illness) were among nine Titans to miss Wednesday's practice due to injury or illness. Among the others to sit out were defensive tackle Sebastian Joseph-Day (biceps) and running back Tyjae Spears (concussion). Linebacker Jack Gibbens (ankle) underwent season-ending surgery earlier this week and will be placed on injured reserve. He was injured and subsequently carted off the field during the loss to Minnesota. Houston defensive end Denico Autry (knee/oblique) sat out Wednesday's session. Defensive tackle Foley Fatukasi (foot) and offensive tackle Blake Fisher (concussion) also missed practice. The Texans have won the past three meetings.

Given Syracuse's struggles to defend and its inability to easily put lesser teams away early in the season, the Orange might need another 38 from Starling on Thursday night when they take on Texas in the Legends Classic in New York. The good news is Starling appears to be capable of doing it any time he walks out on the court. In the team's 3-0 start, the junior guard is averaging a team-high 21.3 points per game and is doing so efficiently, canning 55.6 percent of his shots from the field. Asked why he is playing so well so far, Starling said he is just doing what the Orange need him to do. ""It's a new team so I'm still trying to find my way,"" he said after win over Youngstown State. ""This game is a step forward in the right direction, obviously, in the confidence department. The coaches trusted me with the ball."" While Starling has, well, starred, the Longhorns (3-1) have used a more balanced effort since a season-opening loss to Ohio State. They subsequently routed three straight outmatched foes in Austin, Texas, including an 89-43 blowout of Mississippi Valley State on Saturday. Kansas State transfer Arthur Kaluma and prized freshman Tre Johnson each scored 18 points for Texas, which buried the Delta Devils in the second half, outscoring them 56-20. The Longhorns' offense is averaging 89 points (against 60 for opponents) and shooting 52.9 percent from the field.

Since 2013, New England is 2-9 against the Dolphins in Miami Gardens, Fla., where the Patriots will attempt to pick up a rare win on Sunday afternoon.   First-year coach Jerod Mayo has been in the thick of New England's struggles in the Sunshine State. He spent his entire playing career (2008-15) with the Patriots, then served as inside linebackers coach from 2019-23 before taking over at the helm.   Mayo is making sure that New England (3-8) leaves the past in the past come Sunday, though.   ""First and foremost, I won't address it with the guys as far as the struggles that we've had in Miami, even though they're probably listening to me right now,"" Mayo said. ""But what I will say is every game is unique. ... It's a tough place to play. It's not that it's super loud or anything like that.   ""We just haven't been able to get over the hump.""   Patriots quarterback Drake Maye, the No. 3 overall pick in this year's draft, has given Mayo a reason to believe that New England can turn the corner against Miami (4-6). Maye continued to take steps in the right direction by completing 29 of 39 passes for 282 yards, two touchdowns and one interception during a 28-22 loss to the Los Angeles Rams last Sunday.   Dolphins signal-caller Tua Tagovailoa has been impressed with what he has seen from the 22-year-old Maye so far and is eager to go up against him.   ""I respect his game. I respect his game a lot,"" Tagovailoa said. ""He's a rookie, so there's gonna be bumps within his journey. But you see a lot of flashes of things that he can do, not just inside the pocket, outside of the pocket as well.   ""I got a lot of respect for him, and looking forward to competing against him.""   Tagovailoa most recently threw for 288 yards and three scores on 28-for-36 passing Miami's 34-19 win over the Las Vegas Raiders last Sunday. One of his favorite targets was former New England tight end Jonnu Smith, who hauled in six catches for 101 yards and two TDs.   Miami has rattled off back-to-back wins on the heels of a three-game losing streak that began after a 15-10 victory against the Patriots in Week 5.   ""We're looking to go out there and play the plays with what they've presented us over the years,"" Tagovailoa said, referring to the Dolphins' familiarity with New England's game plan. ""If we need to adjust in any way, we'll adjust.""   Cornerback Kendall Fuller (concussion) and offensive tackle Terron Armstead (knee) missed Miami's practice on Wednesday. Six Dolphins were limited, including star wideout Tyreek Hill (wrist) and cornerback Jalen Ramsey (knee).   Defensive end Deatrich Wise (foot), offensive tackle Vederian Lowe (shoulder) and defensive tackle Jaquelin Roy (neck) did not practice for the Patriots on Wednesday. Safety Kyle Dugger was among those limited -- due to an ankle injury -- and defensive end Keion White (knee) also failed to practice in full.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Tampa Bay (4-6) was two games over .500 and challenging for the NFC South lead a month ago before falling in succession against Baltimore (41-31), Atlanta (31-26), Kansas City (30-24 in overtime) and San Francisco (23-20).  The Giants (2-8) have lost five in a row and are also coming off a bye. Quarterback Tommy DeVito will make his first start of the season and seventh of his two-year career after the Giants announced the benching of Daniel Jones this week after an overtime loss to the woeful Panthers.  ""Tommy Cutlets"" has a career passer rating of 89.2, with eight touchdowns and three interceptions. The 2023 undrafted free agent is 3-3 as a starter. ""Those are never easy conversations,"" Giants coach Brian Daboll said. ""[I've] got a lot of respect for all three of those guys. After evaluating a bunch of things and looking at a lot of tape and being around Tommy last year where he created a little bit of a spark for us, that's the reason why we're going with Tommy."" DeVito had been the third-string quarterback but Daboll chose him over backup Drew Lock. Tampa Bay's potent offense figures to heap even more pressure on DeVito and running back Tyrone Tracy, who has 545 yards and three rushing touchdowns as the Giants' only viable option. Rookie Malik Nabers (607 receiving yards, 3 touchdowns) and Darius Slayton (469, 1) could provide inviting targets for DeVito against a Bucs pass defense that has allowed 20 aerial scores this season, which ranks fifth worst in the NFL. The Giants, meanwhile, have excelled in red-zone defense and rank second in sacks (36). Tampa Bay (4-6) is the only team in the NFL to pass for more than 300 yards and rush for 100 more on four different occasions. The Bucs, led by a committee of Bucky Irving (492 yards, four touchdowns), Rachaad White (306; 1) and Sean Tucker (186; 1) have rushed for more than 100 yards seven times. Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield has been an offensive dynamo. Fourth among Bucs rushers with 192 yards and two scores, he's third in the NFL in touchdown passes (24), total touchdowns (26) and fifth in passer rating (103.6). Mayfield could get back a key contributor on Sunday. Wide receiver Mike Evans, who went down with a hamstring injury in Week 7, returned to practice on Wednesday. Evans had 335 yards and six receiving touchdowns before the injury. Slayton was a full participant on Wednesday as he recovers from a concussion. The wide receiver left the Giants' Week 9 loss to the Commanders and wasn't able to gain clearance to travel to the Giants' Week 10 loss in Germany to the Panthers. Bucs cornerback Zyon McCollum, who departed the 49ers loss with a hamstring injury, did not practice on Wednesday. All-Pro left tackle Tristin Wirfs, who sprained an MCL in the loss to the 49ers, worked on the sideline with trainers. Bucs coach Todd Bowles said it is ""going to be close"" for both players to play on Sunday. Giants outside linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux (wrist) was a limited participant on Wednesday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Heading into their road clash with the Calgary Flames on Thursday, however, the Rangers are happier with their execution of late. ""We were definitely playing not our best hockey, sneaking away with wins, whether it be with goaltending or being able to score a few,"" New York defenseman Adam Fox said, according to Forever Blueshirts. ""Early in the season, there are things you want to clean up ... but the road trip has been good."" The Rangers arrive in Calgary having won three straight games after their 4-3 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday. New York boasts a 7-1-0 road record and has reached the midway point of a four-game trip with two victories. Although the clash against Vancouver was tight, the Rangers controlled play for the bulk of it. However, New York surrendered the first goal of the game on the first shot 34 seconds into the contest. ""We played a really good first period, maybe one of our best,"" Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said. ""We could have done a couple things differently that maybe could have helped prevent (the first goal), but to come right back and score, to me, that's important."" Mika Zibanejad scored less than two minutes later to tie the score, and New York never trailed again after Will Cuylle's sixth goal later in the first period. Chris Kreider supplied the tiebreaking and eventual game-winning tally midway through the third period. ""We were recovering pucks really well,"" Cuylle said. ""Whenever we would get a chance, get a shot and the puck would be loose, we'd be on it really quick and that's how you can sustain the pressure."" The Rangers might also receive a boost for the game. Center Filip Chytil, who missed the past two games, could return after it was determined he did not suffer a concussion against the San Jose Sharks on Thursday. The Flames are halfway through a four-game homestand in which they have rattled off successive wins, including their 2-1 shootout victory over the New York Islanders on Tuesday. Calgary has netted points in six of its past seven games (4-1-2) and continues to be one of the league's early-season surprises. The victory over the Islanders was nearly a textbook example of why the Flames are having success despite being in a rebuilding phase. After falling behind early in the second period, Calgary stayed in the game thanks to strong goaltending from Dustin Wolf before mounting a comeback. ""A lot of battling and competing, lot of chipped pucks,"" said Flames forward Justin Kirkland, who scored one of two shootout goals that sealed the victory. ""It wasn't really your clean game as it normally is, but we battled hard right until the end. As long as it took, we were willing to do that and come out of it with two points."" The Flames have been held to three or fewer goals in 13 consecutive games but have scored 26 third-period goals in 19 contests. They have also benefited from strong goaltending, especially from the rookie Wolf. The two-time AHL goaltender of the year delivered several saves to keep his team within striking distance and then held firm until the shootout, during which he was perfect.  Wolf has a 4-0-1 record in his past five outings while allowing eight goals. Calgary has posted a 7-2-1 record with Wolf between the pipes. He has -- at least for now -- secured the net for a team that had rotated goalies early in the campaign. ""The more comfortable you get in this league, the more you believe in yourself, the more success you're going to have,"" defenseman Rasmus Andersson said of Wolf. ""He for sure believes in himself quite a bit. He's been awesome, especially the last seven, eight games."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Jared McCain added 20 points and Guerschon Yabusele scored 17 for Philadelphia, which lost its fifth straight and for the 10th time in 11 games. Bane's performance offset a difficult outing in a 12-point home loss to Denver on Tuesday, when he finished with five points after shooting 1-of-10 from the floor. He recovered against the 76ers with his second double-double in three games and added six assists. Philadelphia point guard Tyrese Maxey tallied eight points on 3-of-13 shooting with three assists in his return to the lineup after missing six consecutive games with a strained right hamstring. He, Embiid and Paul George played together for the first time this season, but the reunion didn't last long. George left the game less than a minute into the third quarter after suffering a hyperextended left knee while grabbing a rebound. He finished with 2 points on 1-of-6 shooting. Embiid also departed for the locker room at the end of the third quarter, also with a knee injury, but returned midway through the fourth. Memphis led by as many as 19 in the second half but saw its lead dwindle to 115-111 in the closing minute following an Embiid layup. Jackson's two free throws with 16 seconds remaining sealed the win.  The Grizzlies finished 16-of-16 at the line after not attempting a free throw in the first half.

Eason, who had eight points, five assists and three steals before halftime, hit a 3-pointer and added a second-chance basket to stabilize the Rockets.

Walman pulled the Sharks within one by netting his second goal of the season with 6:35 remaining in regulation. Walman received a cross-ice pass as he reached the left circle and immediately snapped a shot home. Granlund's assist on the goal was the 400th helper of his career.

Utah closed to within seven points, 116-109, on Markkanen's layup with 1:42 to play but ran out of time. Jazz coach Will Hardy continues to keep some of his young, untested players in the game while it's still in the balance, trying to reduce their learning curve in key situations. That's part of the team's grand plan, according to Hardy. ""There's moments where you're sort of rolling the dice of like, ‘OK, I want these guys to feel this moment and to have some recognition, and we're communicating in a game, and can we fix it on the fly?' "" Hardy said. ""The rolling-the-dice part is that we might not fix it on the fly (in this game). But that's where we're at, that's what we're doing."" After their game Thursday, Utah and San Antonio will conclude their season series Tuesday in Salt Lake City in an NBA Cup West Group B game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Trailing 39-29 at halftime, the Dolphins (3-2) stepped up the defensive pressure and the result was a 19-5 run to start the second half. Robert McCray's steal and dunk gave Jacksonville of the Atlantic Sun Conference a 48-44 lead with 13:22 remaining.  The Dolphins completed the comeback with an impressive effort down the stretch that included McCray's clutch basket in the paint with 34 seconds to go. Nwokeji made 7 of 13 shots, including four 3-pointers, and grabbed a game-high nine rebounds. McCray scored 17 points and dished out a game-high eight assists, Donovan Rivers scored 10 of Jacksonville's 32 bench points and Kendall Munson chipped in nine points on 4-of-4 shooting. Mylyjael Poteat had 15 points and eight rebounds for Virginia Tech (3-2), which was looking to bounce back from last Friday's 22-point, neutral-site loss to Penn State. Tobi Lawal contributed 14 points on 6-of-9 shooting. Brandon Rechsteiner (11 points) made three of the Hokies' six triples and Jaydon Young scored nine points. Virginia Tech, which lost for the first time at Cassell Coliseum this season, entered Wednesday tied for 301st place in Division I with 15.0 turnovers per game and Jacksonville landed in a tie for 338th (17.0). The Dolphins narrowly won the turnover battle with 14 while turning the Hokies' 16 miscues into 20 points. Jacksonville also defeated a power conference school on Dec. 20, 2010, posting a 71-68 overtime win against the Florida Gators of the Southeastern Conference. Wednesday's game -- the first between Virginia Tech and Jacksonville since 1986 -- was part of the upcoming Fort Myers Tip-Off at Suncoast Credit Union Arena in Florida. The tournament features on-campus games between teams from the Beach and Palms divisions before moving play to Fort Myers, Fla. The Dolphins face Mercer in the Palms Division's second semifinal at 1:30 p.m. on Monday. The Hokies take on Michigan later the same day (6 p.m.) in the Beach Division's first semifinal. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Five other players scored in double figures for the Nittany Lions (5-0): Zach Hicks (17 points), Yanic Konan Niederhauser (16 points, 10 rebounds, five blocks), Nick Kern Jr. (13 points), Freddie Dilione V (11 points) and Puff Johnson (11 points). Penn State shot well from the field (55.7 percent) and the 3-point arc (11 of 25, 44 percent), while its second-half numbers (71.9 percent shooting, 9 of 14 from 3-point range) were even more impressive. Purdue Fort Wayne (3-2) was led by Jalen Jackson's 31 points and Corey Hadnot II's 20 points. Eric Mulder chipped in 12 points and 11 rebounds for the Mastodons. With under 10 minutes remaining, Penn State led just 74-69 before Baldwin's layup kickstarted a 12-0 run. Hicks connected on two 3-pointers during the burst, including a triple that made it 86-69 with 6:57 to play. Purdue Fort Wayne got within 94-85 with 1:27 to go, but Konan Niederhauser threw down a dunk on the next possession, and the hosts cruised to the finish line. The score was close throughout the first half until the Mastodons began to create some separation late in the session. Jackson's 3-pointer with 3:10 left before halftime put Purdue Fort Wayne ahead 39-33, and then he dunked about a minute later to make it 43-35. With 1:27 to go before the break, Quinton Morton-Robertson knocked down a 3-pointer to push the Mastodons' lead to double digits (47-36) for the first time. However, the hosts scored the final five points of the half -- including a 3-pointer by Hicks -- to get within 47-41 at intermission. Baldwin came out firing in the second half, drilling three 3-pointers (one of which became a four-point play) in the first two minutes, turning the six-point halftime deficit into a 51-47 advantage. With under 15 minutes left in the contest, Jackson made three straight bucks to put Purdue Fort Wayne up by a point.

Small also had five rebounds, five assists and four steals for the Mountaineers (3-1), who atoned for a humbling loss Friday at rival Pitt in which they trailed by as many as 31 points. Jonathan Powell provided West Virginia with an instant jolt of offense, scoring all 11 of his points less than 10 minutes into the game. Tucker DeVries contributed 13 points, three steals and three blocks while Amani Hansberry added 10 points and nine rebounds. The sharp-shooting Mountaineers shot 51.8 percent from the floor and made 15 of 31 3-pointers (48.4 percent).  James Patterson scored 12 points and Luke Jungers added 10 points for Iona (1-4) of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, which committed 21 turnovers.

Iona made 23.7 percent of its shots from the floor and 5 of 19 (26.3 percent) from deep in the teams' first-ever meeting. DeVries opened the scoring with a 3-pointer before Powell took over to put the hosts ahead by double digits.

Both left-handers won the pitching Triple Crown, with Sale leading the National League in wins, strikeouts and earned-run average, and Skubal -- who was voted for the award unanimously -- repeating the feat in the American League. It is the first Cy Young Award for each. Sale took the honors over fellow National League finalists Zack Wheeler of the Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates rookie Paul Skenes. Sale received 26 first-place votes and four for second for 198 total points in voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America.  ""This wasn't an easy way to get to winning this trophy for the first time,"" Sale said, per MLB.com. ""As soon as it happened, I'm thinking about people and teammates and coaches and family. It's special to me because of all the hard work that other people put in to get me here."" Wheeler was second with 130 points (four firsts, 25 seconds, one fourth) and Skenes, the NL Rookie of the Year, was third with 53 (one second, 13 thirds, three fourths). Dylan Cease of the Padres (45), Shota Imanaga of the Cubs (38) were also among the top five vote-getters. Sale's teammate, right-hander Reynaldo Lopez, was one of three NL pitchers who received a single fifth-place vote. Skubal, with all 30 first-place votes for 210 points, bested American League finalists Seth Lugo of the Kansas City Royals (93) and Cleveland Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase (66).  ""It's special,"" Skubal said. ""All the hard work, all the stuff that goes on behind the scenes, moments like this make it extremely worth it."" The Royals' Cole Ragans (48), the Orioles' Corbin Burnes (47), the Mariners' Logan Gilbert (25), the Astros' Framber Valdez (17), the Rangers' Kirby Yates (two), the Astros' Yusei Kikuchi (one) and the Guardians' Cade Smith (one) rounded out the voting. Sale, 35, had been in the Cy Young conversation multiple times, the runner-up in 2017 and finishing in the top six in voting for seven consecutive seasons from 2012-18. The award is the crowning achievement in the comeback for Sale, who missed all of the 2020 season following Tommy John surgery and was limited to just 11 combined starts in 2021 and 2022 due to injury. After a 6-5 season with a 4.30 ERA with the Boston Red Sox in 2023, he was traded to the Braves last Dec. 30 along with cash for infielder Vaughn Grissom. In his first season in Atlanta, Sale finished 18-3 with a 2.38 ERA. Over 29 starts and 177 2/3 innings, he struck out 225 batters and walked 39, giving up just nine home runs. He was named the NL Comeback Player of the Year last week. ""My goal at the beginning of this year was just to be healthy,"" Sale said. ""Getting greedy and thinking of things like this would have been maybe a little over my skis. I was coming to a new team that made a trade for me, when I'm sure there were a lot of people that kind of gave that trade the side-eye when it first happened. ... To say I'd be sitting here right now would be crazy. I just wanted to be able to do my job, really."" Sale's season ended in disappointment, however, as a back ailment kept him from pitching in the postseason. In his career with the Chicago White Sox (2010-16), Red Sox (2017-23) and Braves, Sale has a 138-83 record with a 3.04 ERA and 2,414 strikeouts over 372 appearances (292 starts). As for Skubal, he won the award on his 28th birthday. A ninth-round draft pick by the Tigers in 2018, he made his debut in 2020. In 31 starts this season, he finished 18-4 with a 2.39 ERA, striking out 228 and walking 35 over 192 innings. Skubal was 6-2 with a 1.85 ERA over his last eight starts as Detroit surged from eight games below .500 in mid-August into the playoffs for the first time since 2014.  He beat the Astros in Game 1 of the AL wild-card series and finished the postseason 1-1 with a 2.37 ERA in three starts. ""It was a ton of fun to be part of,"" Skubal said. ""The last two months of our season and even the postseason was very special. The memories and the experience will obviously help our club going forward, and I'm glad we got to experience it as a team and as a young team."" Over 106 career regular-season appearances (103 starts), Skubal is 41-31 with a 3.37 ERA. He has 648 strikeouts in 571 1/3 innings. Sale became the first Atlanta pitcher to win the award since Tom Glavine won for the second time in 1998, which capped a dominant decade by Braves pitchers when Glavine, Greg Maddux and John Smoltz combined for six Cy Youngs in eight seasons. Skubal is the third Tigers pitcher in the 2000s to take home the prize, following Justin Verlander (2011) and Max Scherzer (2013). This season was the fourth in major league history that both leagues had a Triple Crown winner in the same year. The last time that happened was 2011, when Verlander of the Tigers and Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers accomplished the feat. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After ending a seven-game skid with a 130-119 victory over the visiting Indiana Pacers, Toronto hopes to further climb out of its early-season slump when it hosts the Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday. ""I don't know if you guys heard the celebration in the locker room, obviously it was a little bit of a relief factor with it,"" said Raptors center Jakob Poeltl, who had 30 points and 15 rebounds against the Pacers. ""And it's obviously great to get that winning feeling back."" RJ Barrett had a season-best 39 points for the Raptors, who are 3-4 at home. Minnesota is 3-4 on the road.  Toronto can avenge a 112-101 road loss to the Timberwolves on Oct. 26 in Thursday's rematch.  The Timberwolves won for the second game in a row with a 120-117 home victory over the Phoenix Suns on Sunday, with Julius Randle hitting a game-ending 3-pointer. Randle had 35 points and Anthony Edwards added 24. The Timberwolves trailed for most of the game and were down by as many as 16 points. ""That's what I'm most proud of, really. Guys found a way to hang in there,"" Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. ""It's a little bit of a microcosm of our season so far. We have just got to find a way to keep battling and eking out some results until we can catch the rhythm that we know is there."" Part of the solution for Minnesota would be steadier defensive play. ""Well, I would hope defensive consistency, for sure,"" Finch said. ""A little smarter play. We have opportunities to take control of the game, seize the game, capitalize. We just have a few too many ill-advised turnovers, still. Our turnover numbers are down, but we had some unfortunately-timed ones (Sunday)."" Minnesota allowed Phoenix to shoot 54.1 percent (46-for-85) from the field and trailed by 10 at halftime. ""We didn't fold,"" said Minnesota center Rudy Gobert, who had 11 points, 10 rebounds and four blocked shots on Sunday. ""So for me, that's what matters is that our mindset is still always going, always competing, always resilient. Then we get better, figure it out. We have guys that want to win. We have a lot of talent in this room, and I think we'll keep re-finding our identity defensively, and once we do that, everything else is going to click."" In the win over Indiana, Toronto trailed once by one point and led by as many as 22 points. The Raptors shot 58.5 percent (48-for-82) from the field, including 48.3 percent (14-for-29) from 3-point range. Poeltl has averaged 30 points and 15 rebounds over the past three games, shooting 71.9 percent (41-for-57) from the field. ""I think what we're doing really well is finding him,"" Raptors coach Darko Rajakovic said. ""(Poeltl is) playing really well in pick-and-rolls. He's getting better in reading when the defense is going over and under and finding his pocket pass. And he's been, as you can see, playing with more force, going downhill and trying to dunk some of those situations.  ""That's a testament to his work,"" Rajakovic continued. ""That's a testament to everything that he did over the course of the summer, and if he continues like this, we're going to have another All-Star player."" Toronto forward Scottie Barnes (right orbital fracture) returned to full practice on Wednesday and is questionable for Thursday's game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The drama will be high for those grinding to earn spots in the first two signature events of 2025 and those trying to battle their way into the top 125 for full playing privileges next year. Our golf experts preview the field and provide their favorite prop picks along with best bets to win this week.

He posted three top-15s against a missed cut through the first four before going T37 in Japan and T30 in Mexico. Kirk, ranked 44th in the world, has been taking it far easier closer to home in Georgia and is a former Sea Island resident. Kirk, who posted a T35 in Utah in his long fall start so far, has played in this event every year since its inception. --Austin Eckroat Top 30 (+105 at BetRivers): Eckroat won his most recent start in Mexico two weeks ago and said it proved his maiden tour win at the Cognizant Classic in March wasn't a fluke. We agree. Eckroat reached the second round of the FedEx Cup playoffs on the strength of a strong season, and riding a wave of confidence he should be in contention against a fall field. --Callum Tarren Top English Finisher (+550): OK, we're closing out 2024 with a longshot selection. The big-hitting Tarren rebounded from a trio of missed cuts with a T37 last week. Granted, he has also missed seven of his past nine cuts overall. Matt Wallace is understandably the -150 favorite in this prop as the 65th-ranked player in the world comes off a T11 at the DP World Championship. We're banking on some jet lag as Wallace crossed the ocean to play his third consecutive week. Also in this prop are David Skinns (+400) and Ben Taylor (+650). Skinns has made four consecutive cuts during the PGA Tour fall swing, while Taylor has missed four of six cuts this fall. 2024 Prop Picks Record: 53-60 BEST BETS --Aberg (+900 at DraftKings) is making his first start since finishing 16th at the Tour Championship as he defends his lone tour win to date following knee surgery earlier this fall.

Sure, the Capitals have scored a whopping 27 goals during their five-game point streak (4-0-1), including 16 during an emphatic sweep of a three-game road trip that began with a 5-2 victory over the Avalanche on Friday. That said, Washington was dealt a severe blow after superstar captain Alex Ovechkin sustained a lower-leg injury following a collision during the third period of Monday's 6-2 victory over the Utah Hockey Club. The Capitals labeled Ovechkin as week-to-week on Tuesday and placed him on injured reserve Wednesday. They recalled forward Ivan Miroshnichenko from the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League in a corresponding move. The loss of Ovechkin obviously is a substantial one. The three-time Hart Trophy recipient has scored 13 goals in his last 11 games to boost his career total to 868, which is just 27 removed from breaking Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky's all-time record of 894 set from 1978-99. ""It (stinks),"" Capitals forward Nic Dowd said. ""Hate to see it. He's been absolutely on fire and he's huge for our team. He's our captain. You've got to score goals to win games. He's been playing incredible hockey, so, yeah, I hate to see it."" He's not alone. ""(Ovechkin is) our leader,"" goaltender Charlie Lindgren said, per the Washington Post. ""He's our bull. It's tough to see him go down. ... He's a guy that's doing it all right now, not just scoring. He's the captain for a reason."" Lindgren made 17 saves against the Avalanche to snap a modest two-game skid. He also handed Colorado its lone loss in its last five games. The Avalanche rebounded from the setback to the Capitals and opened a four-game road trip on Monday with a 3-2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers. Defenseman Cale Makar scored two goals to boost his point total to 27 (eight goals, 19 assists) in 19 games. ""I felt like we were offensively rolling,"" Makar said. ""When the forwards are moving around, it's fun for us as (defensemen). We can kind of move up top and create space. So yeah, I thought we were working out well."" The former Calder, Norris and Smythe Trophy winner could have capped his performance with a hat trick, but his apparent tally was disallowed due to netminder interference. ""He got two, I'm not sure about the third one that was disallowed,"" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. ""He got into some good areas on some nice plays from some other players on our team, (Nathan MacKinnon) fed across on the one right into the slot.  ""Just picked the right spots, I felt like (on Monday), to get up in the rush and join, especially on the entries into the (offensive) zone. In the (offensive) zone play, he was pretty active.

The Lions head into Indiana on Sunday with an eight-game winning streak, their longest since their first season in Detroit in 1934. They carved up Jacksonville 52-6, while scoring touchdowns on their first seven possessions last week. ""They're tough on all three phases, and it shows,"" Steichen said. ""It definitely shows. All those guys are flying around, making plays. They're having fun doing it."" Led by Jared Goff, Detroit (9-1) leads the NFL in points scored (33.6 per game) and point differential (plus-159) this season. Goff bounced back from a five-interception outing in Houston by throwing for 412 yards and four touchdowns against the hapless Jaguars. Top target Amon-Ra St. Brown caught 11 passes for a season-high 161 yards and two touchdowns. St. Brown has a receiving touchdown in eight straight games. And the running back duo of David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs has combined to rush for almost 1,400 yards and 18 touchdowns. The powerful Montgomery has found the end zone 10 times, including twice against Jacksonville. ""He's a throwback. There are throwback principles about him, and I mean that with all due respect,"" head coach Dan Campbell said. ""His running style is -- it's rare. David is just different, and he's downhill, doesn't give up, first guy, he's not going to let him tackle him, continues to churn his legs, and just violent, violent, never give up, never going down."" The lightning-quick Gibbs is averaging 6.0 yards per carry and has eight rushing touchdowns. His one reception last week went for 54 yards.   ""To me, they're the perfect combination,"" Campbell said.   Indianapolis is scoring just 21.5 points per game and has reached the 30-point mark only one time, in a 37-34 loss at Jacksonville. The Colts rallied to beat the New York Jets last week in the return of super-sized quarterback Anthony Richardson. But Detroit isn't just any opponent. The Lions established a new franchise record for points in a six-game stretch last week with 232. ""Their offense is super-powered, so we're going to have to do our part, and we're excited for it,"" receiver Michael Pittman said. The Colts (5-6) reinstated Richardson in the lineup and snapped a three-game losing streak. In the 28-27 victory, Richardson passed for one touchdown and ran for two more, including the go-ahead score with 46 seconds left. ""Very encouraged,"" Steichen said of Richardson's outing. ""I think when you go through a three-game stretch like we had and you go on the road and get a win, and winning in the two-minute drive, you get some momentum -- the confidence. Obviously, coming back at home, we've got to continue that momentum and carry that confidence into this week. We're looking forward to it."" Richardson wasn't picked off in 30 attempts, though he fumbled twice and the Jets recovered one of them. He has fumbled eight times this season and lost three of them. They'll be facing a much tougher opponent this week, though one of the Lions' top defenders, linebacker Alex Anzalone, sustained a broken forearm on Sunday and was placed on injured reserve. ""Just seeing the toughness from our team. We're definitely trying to carry that over because we know we're getting ready to play a physical team,"" Richardson said. ""So, they're going to bring it to us. We got to bring it to them. But just trusting my guys each and every play, like I did in that fourth quarter, and just trust in my ability. I feel like I'm a decent football player, and I like to make plays out there."" Detroit tight end Sam LaPorta missed Sunday's game with a shoulder injury but could return this week. He was listed as a full participant in Wednesday's walk-through.  The Colts listed only offensive tackle Bernhard Raimann (knee) as a non-participant in their walk-through on Wednesday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Both left-handers won the pitching Triple Crown, with Sale leading the National League in wins, strikeouts and earned-run average, and Skubal -- who was voted for the award unanimously -- repeating the feat in the American League. It is the first Cy Young Award for each. Sale took the honors over fellow National League finalists Zack Wheeler of the Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates rookie Paul Skenes. Sale received 26 first-place votes and four for second for 198 total points in voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Wheeler was second with 130 points (four firsts, 25 seconds, one fourth) and Skenes, the NL Rookie of the Year, was third with 53 (one second, 13 thirds, three fourths). Dylan Cease of the Padres (45), Shota Imanaga of the Cubs (38) and Logan Webb of the Giants (18) rounded out the voting. Skubal, with all 30 first-place votes for 210 points, bested American League finalists Seth Lugo of the Kansas City Royals (93) and Cleveland Guardians closer Emmanual Clase (66). The Royals' Cole Ragans (48), the Orioles' Corbin Burnes (47), the Mariners' Logan Gilbert (25), the Astros' Framber Valdez (17), the Rangers' Kirby Yates (two), the Astros' Yusei Kikuchi (one) and the Guardians' Cade Smith (one) rounded out the voting. Sale, 35, had been in the Cy Young conversation multiple times, the runner-up in 2017 and finishing in the top six in voting for seven consecutive seasons from 2012-18. The award is the crowning achievement in the comeback for Sale, who missed all of the 2020 season following Tommy John surgery and was limited to just 11 combined starts in 2021 and 2022 due to injury. After a 6-5 season with a 4.30 ERA with the Boston Red Sox in 2023, he was traded to the Braves last Dec. 30 along with cash for infielder Vaughn Grissom. In his first season in Atlanta, Sale finished 18-3 with a 2.38 ERA. Over 29 starts and 177 2/3 innings, he struck out 225 batters and walked 39, giving up just nine home runs. He was named the NL Comeback Player of the Year last week. Sale's season ended in disappointment, however, as a back ailment kept him from pitching in the postseason. In his career with the Chicago White Sox (2010-16), Red Sox (2017-23) and Braves, Sale has a 138-83 record with a 3.04 ERA and 2,414 strikeouts over 372 appearances (292 starts). As for Skubal, he won the award on his 28th birthday. A ninth-round draft pick by the Tigers in 2018, he made his debut in 2020. In 31 starts this season, he finished 18-4 with a 2.39 ERA, striking out 228 and walking 35 over 192 innings. In the postseason, he was 1-1 (2.37 ERA) in three starts. Over 106 career regular-season appearances (103 starts), Skubal is 41-31 with a 3.37 ERA. He has 648 strikeouts in 571 1/3 innings. Sale became the first Atlanta pitcher to win the award since Tom Glavine won for the second time in 1998, which capped a dominant decade by Braves pitchers when Glavine, Greg Maddux and John Smoltz combined for six Cy Youngs in eight seasons. Skubal is the third Tigers pitcher in the 2000s to take home the prize, following Justin Verlander (2011) and Max Scherzer (2013). This season was the fourth in MLB history that both leagues had a Triple Crown winner in the same year. The last time that happened was 2011, with Verlander of the Tigers and Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Paolini's 6-2, 6-1 triumph in 66 minutes over Sramkova came after Lucia Bronzetti dispatched Viktoria Hruncakova 6-2, 6-4 in one hour and 23 minutes. The Italians redeemed themselves after falling to Canada in last year's final. Bronzetti quickly pulled away from Hruncakova after three competitive games in the first set. She converted 6 of 9 break points overall and committed eight fewer unforced errors (26-18) than Hruncakova to set it up for Paolini, who had little trouble finishing off the underdog Slovakians. The World No. 4 won 71 percent of her first serve points (22 of 31) and faced just two break points, saving one of them. Sramkova's 28 unforced errors proved too much to overcome as Paolini atoned for her loss to Canada's Leylah Fernandez 12 months ago and clinched Italy's fifth Billie Jean King Cup title and first since 2013. Sara Errani, 37, was a member of both championship teams. Slovakia last won the title in 2002. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Meanwhile, it's been nearly a month since the Columbus Blue Jackets won back-to-back games.  After losing four straight, the Lightning will aim to notch their fourth straight win when they visit the Blue Jackets on Thursday. Tampa Bay opened November on an 0-3-1 slide, but has since outscored opponents 11-3 during its current three-game winning streak.  On Tuesday at Pittsburgh, the Lightning trailed 2-0 after two periods, but Brayden Point scored twice, including 3:58 into overtime, for a 3-2 Tampa Bay victory that snapped its three-game road skid.  ""I think it just shows what we need to be successful,"" said Point, who returned Tuesday after missing four games with a lower-body injury. ""I think that third period is how we're going to have to win games ... Just good defending and working our chances.""  Anthony Cirelli also scored for a third consecutive game and Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 17 of 19 shots faced. Vasilevskiy has stymied 99 of 103 attempts over his last four starts (3-0-1). Meanwhile, Point has 10 goals with 15 points in the 13 games he's played this season.  ""He's got an engine, that kid. He's got a nose for the net,"" Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. ""We're obviously a much better team when Point is in the lineup.""   Tampa Bay has won 10 of the last 12 meetings with Columbus, with Point scoring three times in the last five contests between the teams.  Vasilevskiy has a 2.37 goals-against average and .914 save percentage during his eight-game starting winning streak against the Blue Jackets. However, Lightning backup Jonas Johansson has allowed five goals in each of his two starts versus Columbus.  Like Tampa Bay, the Blue Jackets opened November in rough fashion, going 0-5-1 before winning two of the last three. Elvis Merzlikins made 28 saves and five different players scored during Columbus' 5-1 win at Boston on Monday -- which paved the way for the Bruins to fire coach Jim Montgomery.  The Blue Jackets have won two straight games only once this season (Oct. 28 and 30), though there seemed plenty to build on from Monday's win.  ""We can now reinforce a lot of stuff that we did in (Monday's) game,"" Columbus coach Dean Evason said. ""But, it has to be consistent. Hopefully, that propels us forward to do the right things.""  Merzlikins has stopped 49 of 52 shots to win his last two starts after posting a 3.99 goals-against average while going 0-3-1 in the previous four. He has a 2.21 GAA and .929 save percentage while going 3-1-1 as starter at home against the Lightning during his career.   Meanwhile, the Blue Jackets' Daniil Tarasov has a 4.78 GAA during his current 0-3-1 starting rut this season.  Columbus' Kirill Marchenko has a team-leading 16 points but produced just one in the last four games. However, the Blue Jackets' young star owns five goals with one assist in five career games versus Tampa Bay.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Those seemingly rank in no particular order for the Packers (8-3), although they don't shy from living at least partially in the past ahead of a Week 12 showdown. Host San Francisco eliminated Green Bay 24-21 in the NFC divisional playoffs last season, scoring 10 unanswered points in the fourth quarter. ""That's what you've got to sit with all offseason, is going back, watching the game, trying to see what you could have done better,"" Packers quarterback Jordan Love said. ""What you could have done differently in that game. ... Just knowing that's the team that knocked us out, we're definitely hungry for this game."" Ditto for San Francisco. The 49ers fell to 5-5 after last week's 20-17 home loss to Seattle, done in by Geno Smith's 13-yard touchdown run with 12 seconds to play. Still only a game behind NFC West-leading Arizona, the reigning conference champion 49ers are just 1-3 in division play and can ill afford to lose more ground.  A visit to AFC East leader Buffalo awaits after the trip to Green Bay. The good news: the 49ers anticipate the return of some key contributors. Cornerback Charvarius Ward, who missed the past two games following the death of his 1-year-old daughter, practiced Wednesday. Tight end George Kittle also is eager to play after a nagging hamstring injury sidelined him against the Seahawks. ""Very excited,"" he said. ""Can't pass up playing the Packers, so no, I will be out there for sure."" San Francisco quarterback Brock Purdy is day-to-day with right shoulder soreness, but coach Kyle Shanahan said Purdy is on track to play. Shanahan and Packers head coach Matt LaFleur have been fierce competitors since twice working together, first as low-level assistants with the Texans in 2008, then on the so-called ""dream team"" staff in Washington that included Sean McVay and two seasons with the Falcons (2015, 2016) where LaFleur was quarterbacks coach and Shanahan called the plays. Shanahan scored the most recent win over LaFleur in January. Green Bay has won seven of the past eight regular-season meetings between the franchises.  But the familiarity and shared-brain approach to offense that has the coaches completed each other's play calls has led to some tight games. The past three at Lambeau Field were all decided by three points.  Green Bay, which hosts a home game on Thanksgiving next Thursday, is starting a run of three games in 12 days. They'll play back-to-back Thursday games. Their Week 14 game is at Detroit.  That might make it good news for LaFleur that surprising contributors have emerged of late.  Packers wideout Christian Watson had a career-best 150 receiving yards on only four catches during last week's 20-19 road win against the Chicago Bears. His diving 60-yard reception in the fourth quarter put the Packers in position for Love's go-ahead, 1-yard scoring run with 2:59 to play.  Watson entered the game with eight catches for 83 yards over his previous three contests, but LaFleur assured Watson remains a ""big part"" of the attack. ""He's a guy who's got every measurable known to man in terms of the size, the speed, and it's not like those were easy plays he was making,"" LaFleur said. ""He was making tough, contested catches."" San Francisco will aim to generate more pressure against Love than the Bears, who sacked him just once. The 49ers collected four sacks against the Seahawks, with Nick Bosa and Leonard Floyd contributing 1.5 apiece. Bosa (hip/oblique) didn't practice Wednesday but 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said this week ""there's just as good of a chance for him to not play as play."" Recent regular-season history between the Packers and 49ers at Lambeau Field has favored Green Bay.  The Packers have won seven of their past eight home games against the 49ers and are 22-11 versus San Francisco at home all-time. Green Bay leads the series 34-28-1. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

They will wrap up a five-game road trip at Detroit on Thursday night. The Islanders have at least one point in six of their last seven games (3-1-3), but they've lost four of their last five. A pair of those defeats came in overtime and their latest outing was decided by a shootout. They had won their previous two shootouts, but Calgary pulled out a 2-1 win on Tuesday. ""It was a hard-fought game. I thought both teams played very well,"" head coach Patrick Roy said. ""I look at it like it's a point, and I wish we had more than one point."" Most of the Islanders' contests are hard fought and low scoring. Only twice during their first 19 games has either side scored more than five goals. Ilya Sorokin and Semyon Varlamov have been sharing goaltending duties.  Varlamov stopped 30 of 31 shots before the shootout on Tuesday. He has allowed two or fewer goals in his last four starts. However, the offense stalled after Pierre Engvall's second-period tally. ""There wasn't a whole lot out there, both ways,"" defenseman Noah Dobson said. ""In the third period, we had lots of great looks, just didn't capitalize. We've got to find a way to get that second one and extend the lead when we have those one-goal leads."" The Islanders will match up with the Red Wings twice in the next five nights. They'll play again on the Islanders' home ice on Monday night. Their first meeting on Oct. 22 was a night of frustration for the Islanders. They had a 30-11 advantage in shots on goal but Detroit pulled out a 1-0 win as Patrick Kane's first-period goal stood up. That was one of just three goals in 18 games for the future Hall of Famer this season, one reason why the Red Wings have a losing record. Detroit has won just one of its last six contests (1-4-1), with the lone victory coming in overtime against Pittsburgh on Nov. 13. That contest began a four-game road trip. The Red Wings went 0-2-1 the rest of the journey, including a 5-4 overtime loss to San Jose on Monday. ""The whole game was missed opportunities,"" captain Dylan Larkin said. ""We got one point (in the standings), but we could have had two and finished the road trip on a good note. We didn't do that."" The Sharks' Tyler Toffoli scored in the final minute of the second period to tie the game at 3. Wings coach Derek Lalonde felt that was the pivotal play. ""That one at the end of the period was a huge momentum goal,"" he said. ""I give our guys credit to find a way to get a point on the road, but a big part of it was the momentum of that second-period goal."" Detroit has many issues to fix. The club has relied too much on their first line of Larkin, Alex DeBrincat and Lucas Raymond, who are their top three scorers. They have been outshot in a vast majority of their games and their defense has sagged, allowing 15 goals in the last three contests.  Also, the Red Wings' penalty kill unit ranked last in the NHL at 66.7 percent, just ahead of the Islanders (67.5), entering Wednesday's action. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Something had to give amid Boston's current sluggish start. The Bruins were dominated in a 5-1 loss Monday to the visiting Columbus Blue Jackets -- who had lost seven of their previous eight -- and fell back below .500 at 8-9-3. While the Bruins have scored more than two goals just once in their last five games, focusing on the back end is a main way Sacco plans to help his team out of its rut. They have allowed 12 goals in their past two regulation losses. ""I think a lot of it right now is a mindset with the group,"" Sacco said. ""One thing we're going to focus on is being a harder team to play against, I mean just stingier. ... If you look at the 10 years I've been here, we've always been a team that takes pride in ... defending the net front."" Sacco assumed his new title Tuesday following the firing of Jim Montgomery, who was 120-41-23 in two-plus regular seasons and 9-11 in the Stanley Cup playoffs as Boston's leader.  Sacco has assisted Boston's three previous bench bosses in Claude Julien, Bruce Cassidy and Montgomery, all of whom have won the Jack Adams Award in their Bruins tenures. Sacco also has four seasons of head coaching experience with the Colorado Avalanche (2009-13). Captain Brad Marchand, who has scored in just two of his last eight contests, knows that the players must accept responsibility for the decision by general manager Don Sweeney and the Bruins. ""This is a reflection of our play and it was avoidable,"" he said. ""If we would have done our job, (Montgomery would) still be around. We feel really terrible ... that we let a really good coach and a really good person down."" Plenty of Bruins have not lived up to their potential, including key offseason signings Elias Lindholm and Nikita Zadorov, and goaltender Jeremy Swayman, who held out until signing a contract extension just before the season. ""We have to get back to the simplest things, the foundation of what we are -- and that's working and competing,"" defenseman Charlie McAvoy said. ""There's too much skill and talent in this room for it not to come together."" Utah arrives in Boston having dropped back-to-back games and five of seven (2-4-1) following a 6-2 defeat Monday to the Washington Capitals in which the team's power play was 0-for-7. The Hockey Club is also just 3-7-2 after Oct. 19, when it beat the visiting Bruins 2-1 on defenseman Michael Kesselring's first career overtime game-winner. ""It's easy to sit here and say that we hit crossbars, but that's no excuse,"" forward Lawson Crouse said. ""We have to find a way to put the puck in the back of the net."" Coach Andre Tourigny shook up his lines in practice Wednesday, including moving winger Dylan Guenther onto the top line with Clayton Keller and Nick Bjugstad and dropping Nick Schmaltz down to the third line and second power-play unit. Schmaltz has not scored this season, and just two of his 13 assists have come in the last seven games. ""I think it's to take some pressure off him,"" Tourigny said.  With four road games in six nights upcoming, Utah recalled goaltender Jaxson Stauber from AHL Tucson after Connor Ingram went down in Monday's loss with an upper-body injury.  ""I don't know when (he will get a start),"" Tourigny said. ""One day at a time, (but) his time will come."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Panthers (3-7) have won two games in a row and are coming off an open week.   The Chiefs (9-1) don't have a winning streak for the first time since January. They lost last weekend at Buffalo, though they share the best record in the NFL with the Detroit Lions. The Chiefs are bound to be paying attention to more details after a rare disappointment for the two-time reigning Super Bowl champions.   ""Try to use this as a spark so that we can be a better football team in the end,"" Mahomes said of the loss to the Bills.   Mahomes said the Chiefs are keeping perspective after their first defeat since Christmas Day 2023 (20-14 to the Las Vegas Raiders).   ""The undefeated thing was cool, but that's not our ultimate goal,"" he said.   Kansas City lost back-to-back games once last season but not during their 14-3 season in 2022. They dropped two in a row once in 2021 and finished 12-5 but ran up a 14-2 record in 2020 without losing consecutive games.  Chiefs head coach Andy Reid said the focus clicked quickly from Buffalo to the Panthers without players discussing being undefeated.  ""I don't really hear a lot of that talk from them or think they care too much about that, other than exhausting yourself the best you can to prepare yourself for that team there that week."" Reid said. ""Then you get to a point where you say, 'Listen, I've done everything I possibly can. Here's a product.' And you go play."" Mahomes challenges defenses in multiple ways even operating with an offense dented by injuries. There's a chance running back Isiah Pacheco (broken leg) returns from injured reserve, but Reid said that decision wouldn't be made until late in the week.  Pacheco's hard-charging style commands a team approach to tackling, but Carolina doesn't want to distract from intent to keep Mahomes under wraps.   With defensive backs doing better at formation identification, the Panthers are giving themselves a stronger chance to be effective at the back end.   ""And making plays when the ball comes to them,"" first-year coach Dave Canales said. ""So a lot of growth there.""   The Panthers are sticking with Bryce Young at quarterback, something that was expected given a couple of victories since he returned to the first-string role.   ""This is about the continued progress,"" Canales said. ""Bryce looks more and more confident.""   With a quarterback who's still trying to settle in and bolster production, the Panthers expect that the Chiefs will dial up some defensive packages to test Young's ability to handle different looks.   ""We just have to be prepared for those answers,"" Canales said. ""They're going to have variety, (so) let's do our best stuff as fast that we can to try to put a little bit of stress on them.""   The Panthers won't be overconfident by any stretch. They're aware of what the Chiefs are all about.   ""I feel like we just got to tighten up our details even more knowing that they're coming in to find a way to win,"" Carolina cornerback Jaycee Horn said.   The Panthers were without starting left guard Damien Lewis because of illness Wednesday, but otherwise the team's list of available players should be growing. Receiver Adam Thielen is expected to be in action for the first time since September as he comes off a hamstring ailment.   Perhaps the biggest development that has been brewing for a few weeks is that running back Jonathan Brooks (knee) should be set for his NFL debut.

Jones, 30, was placed on injured reserve on Saturday. He may have been hurt while blocking a shot in Chicago's 3-1 loss to Seattle, coach Luke Richardson told reporters on Wednesday. ""Unfortunate for us and him, he was rolling along pretty good,"" Richardson said ahead of Chicago's game Thursday against the visiting Florida Panthers. ""But that's just the nature of the business."" Entering Wednesday, Jones -- who has 10 points (two goals, eight assists) in 17 games this season -- led all skaters in ice time at 25:43.  Jones was the No. 4 overall pick in 2013 by the Nashville Predators. In 814 games over 12 seasons with the Predators (2013-16), Columbus Blue Jackets (2016-21) and Blackhawks (2021-present), the four-time All-Star blueliner has 415 points (92 goals, 323 assists). ""He's got a calming presence back there with the puck,"" fellow Blackhawks defenseman Alex Vlasic said on Monday. ""It's safe to say when he's out there, you trust him and you're not worrying about things going wrong or him necessarily making any mistakes.  ""He's very steady and the mistakes he does make he's able to make up for with his defensive skill, not only the defensive side but offensive as well. He's a big help and contributes to our offense. So yeah, especially now with us lacking that kind of part of our game, our scoring, (his absence) is definitely hurting us."" Richardson said defenseman Artyom Levshunov, the No. 2 overall pick by the Blackhawks in this year's draft, likely won't be called up to fill Jones' spot. Chicago's coach also said defenseman Kevin Korchinski, who along with Levshunov is playing with Rockford of the American Hockey League, is also not expected to join the NHL club. A fractured foot suffered during the offseason prevented the 19-year-old Levshunov from practicing with the Blackhawks until Oct. 22.  Korchinski, 20, was selected No. 7 overall in 2022 but didn't play in the AHL least season. The Canadian Hockey League and the NHL have an agreement that a CHL player can't suit up in the AHL until the age of 20.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Louisville (6-4, 4-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) returns after allowing Stanford to score 10 points in the final 45 seconds to upset the then-No. 19 Cardinals 38-35.  The Cardinals fell out of this week's College Football Playoff rankings when the selection committee released them on Tuesday night. The Panthers (7-3, 3-3) lost their third straight when then-No. 20 Clemson scored a touchdown with 1:16 remaining to win 24-20. Pitt outgained the visitors 438-346 but committed two turnovers and allowed eight sacks. In addition, coach Pat Narduzzi's team committed a season-high 13 penalties for 100 yards. Three came in succession when the Panthers had a third-and-goal from the Clemson 1. Instead of possibly scoring a touchdown, Pitt settled for a field goal.  Like Pitt, Louisville committed a season-high 13 for 102 yards. Flags negated two interceptions and a sack. Another gave Stanford a second chance for a two-point conversion. Others were even costlier. Stanford got the ball at its 45 with five seconds remaining after Louisville turned it over on downs. In that time, the Cardinals committed two penalties, allowing Stanford to win on a 52-yard field goal as time expired. Speaking to reporters Monday, Brohm said he's fine if the players are still stung from the loss. ""We feel the pain, and you got to let it motivate you to want to not let it happen again,"" Brohm said.  Pitt may not know until the end of this week whether starting quarterback Eli Holstein can play. He suffered a head injury in the loss to Virginia two weeks ago. Nate Yarnell started against Clemson and threw for 350 yards and a touchdown. The Panthers have dealt with a rash of injuries, but the offensive line has especially taken a beating. With three regulars out, there's been a rotation on the line, which is a reason for some of the penalties. The injuries come at a point in the season when Narduzzi tries to limit practicing to save players. ""We've not cut the practice back yet because we needed to work the last two weeks,"" he explained. Louisville may play Saturday without Isaac Brown, who left the Stanford game with a shoulder contusion. Brohm hopes the freshman, whose 7.4 yards per carry ranks second in FBS, can play but was uncertain on Monday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Coming off a 33-25 home loss to Syracuse, Cal (5-5, 1-5 ACC) remains one win shy of bowl eligibility. The Golden Bears complete the regular season next Saturday at No. 13 SMU. Stanford (3-7, 2-5) already is assured of its sixth straight campaign without postseason play despite a surprising 38-35 home win over then-No. 19 Louisville last week. The Cardinal finish with a non-conference matchup at San Jose State next Friday. Cal hopes to unleash star running back Jaydn Ott on the Cardinal like it did in last year's 27-15 road win, when the then-sophomore dominated the game with 166 yards rushing. But the All-American candidate hasn't come close to duplicating those kinds of numbers this year after suffering a sprained ankle in Cal's season-opening win over UC Davis. He hasn't rushed for more than 78 yards in any game this year, with his season high coming last week against Syracuse. Ott isn't the only Big Game performer who is coming off his best effort of the season. Stanford's Ashton Daniels earned ACC Quarterback of the Week for his 298-yard, three-touchdown showing against Louisville. Cal safety Craig Woodson said he and his teammates saw Daniels' performance on tape and weren't impressed. ""We still feel the same way about them. We're coming out Saturday to dominate them,"" Woodson boasted. ""With them beating Louisville, it doesn't change anything. It just makes us even more (determined) to show them y'all's the little dogs and we're the Bears."" The best Stanford can do this year is finish with five wins. Cardinal coach Troy Taylor noted any season, regardless of the total number of wins, contains a lifetime memory if it includes a win over the Northern California rival. ""The games are usually decided by a touchdown, so teams do typically rise to the occasion regardless of the records and no matter what's going on,"" he observed. ""It's really what is great about college sports. Hopefully it'll be another great one for Stanford folk."" Cal has won the last three Big Games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

That happened earlier this week when guard LaMelo Ball was off the court late in a game. ""I think every night it can be somebody different,"" Lee said. ""They all have to accept the fact that if another guy has it going, we probably have to ride that hand."" The Hornets will be back in action Thursday night against the visiting Detroit Pistons. This will be a rematch of Charlotte's one-point victory earlier this month. The Hornets have lost four of their last five games, including Tuesday night's 116-115 setback at Brooklyn. Ball didn't play down the stretch, finishing with season lows in points (12) and minutes (24). Charlotte has won its last three home games, including two outcomes by one point. The first game in that home streak was a 108-107 victory against Detroit on Nov. 6, when Miles Bridges was Charlotte's top scorer with 27 points. Until Tuesday, that was the only time a player other than Ball led the Hornets in scoring during a nine-game stretch. Lost amid the hubbub regarding Tuesday's fourth quarter was the fact that Charlotte scored a season-high point total in the first quarter in holding a 37-23 lead. The Hornets made 13 of 19 shots from the field during that 12-minute span. Since losing at Charlotte, the Pistons have compiled a 4-3 record. They played Monday night, falling 122-112 at home to the Chicago Bulls. ""There were things that we could have done better,"" Detroit coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""Give them credit. They made shots. They made contested shots."" Bickerstaff mostly gave the Bulls credit for connecting on 23 shots from 3-point range, but certainly that will be something the Pistons address from a defensive standpoint. Chicago made 50 percent of its treys. Cade Cunningham has led Detroit in scoring in five of the last seven games, pumping in 26 points against the Bulls. Cunningham averages a team-high 23.2 points per game. The Pistons had Tim Hardaway Jr. back for Monday's game after he sat out three games with a head injury. Malik Beasley had good production in Hardaway's absence, but Beasley went back to a bench role. ""If you're injured and you are a starter, you come back and you'll be a starter,"" Bickerstaff said. Hardaway went 1-for-10 from the field, missing all eight 3-point attempts, in 30 minutes of playing time. Beasley came off the bench to play 30 minutes, providing 21 points. Detroit's Jalen Duren pulled in 22 rebounds Monday. His 12 offensive rebounds were the most for a Piston at that end of the court since March 2015. The status of Charlotte reserve guard Tre Mann, who averages 14.8 points per game, still warrants monitoring because of his sore back. He has been out of action in a couple of recent games. ""Everybody on our team has been so critical as we've been kind of short-handed,"" Lee said. ""Having Tre back I think gives us another ball handler."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Unrivaled, co-founded by WNBA stars Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart, revealed the rosters as it prepares for its inaugural opening day on Jan. 17.  In addition to Collier and Stewart, reigning rebounding leader Angel Reese, second-leading scorer Arike Ogunbowale and several other WNBA All-Stars are set to play. Others include Aliyah Boston, Jewell Loyd, Dearica Hamby, Kahleah Copper, Alyssa Thomas and Brittney Griner. ESPN reported Wednesday that Clark will not play in the upstart league.  The league will feature six teams and 34 players, though a pair of teams will have each have a wild-card roster spot to fill. Players were put into six pods, with bigs, wings and guards in each pod. Unrivaled's six coaches selected one player from each pod and assigned the player to one of the six teams. None of the coaches knew which team they would be assigned. Aiming to supplement players' income between WNBA seasons, the league promises the highest average salary in the history of women's professional sports. Among the investors are Megan Rapinoe, Carmelo Anthony, Steve Nash and Alex Morgan. A'ja Wilson and Sabrina Ionescu are among the WNBA stars who have yet to join Unrivaled. UConn star Paige Buecker signed an NIL deal with the league but will not participate in games this season. She's the first NCAA athlete to have a stake in the ownership equity of a league.  Collier and Stewart's teams will face off in the league's opener on Jan. 17. The season will last eight weeks and culminate in the championship on March 17.

While the Chiefs opened the 21-day window for Pacheco and Omenihu last week, Reid immediately ruled out playing either one at Buffalo. He's keeping the door open for one or both to show they're ready to play in the Week 12 game in Charlotte, but he's not going to let Pacheco determine his return date without medical input.  ""He's a spark plug now, emotionally,"" Reid said. ""He's something that way and he's worked his tail off to get to the point that he's at now. We've got to keep an eye on him that way.

The Tigers (3-1) lost 84-71 at Boise State on Sunday despite a career-high 30 points from Chase Hunter.  The game featured seven lead changes, and the Tigers trailed by just one point at halftime before the Broncos pulled away in the second half. Clemson got outrebounded by eight and shot just 24 percent (6 of 25) from 3-point distance. Boise State also received 21 points from its bench, while Clemson's reserves mustered just eight. But for coach Brad Brownell, the bright spot, of course, was Hunter, who was 12 of 21 from the floor (4 of 8 from behind the arc) and dished six assists in 37 minutes. ""Chase was fantastic,"" Brownell said. ""I thought he played at an elite level."" Against elite teams, however, Clemson will need more than just heroics from Hunter, who leads the team with 19.8 points and 3.5 assists per game.

""He's playing with a lot of confidence right now and we're really counting on him."" A win separates the Eagles from bowl eligibility for the second straight season. They beat SMU in the Fenway Bowl last December.  ""At the end of the day, it's all about North Carolina. If you take care of business, then you'll be eligible,"" O'Brien said. ""We've got a big challenge ahead of us, so I think that's our focus."" North Carolina is 6-2 in the all-time series, having won five straight since Boston College claimed the 2004 Continental Tire Bowl in Charlotte. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Evans and Chris Godwin (ankle) were injured in the same 41-31 loss to the Baltimore Ravens on Oct. 21. Godwin, still the team leader with 50 receptions, is out for the year.  Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield said Evans looked good and is positive about his chances of getting back in the lineup this week when the Buccaneers (4-6) play at the New York Giants (2-8).  ""You guys know: Mike's a pro. He's going to do everything he can to get back out there with us and fight for this team as we take it one game at a time,"" Mayfield said Wednesday. Evans jumps back into the lineup as the team's leader with six touchdown receptions. However, his 10-season streak of 1,000-yard campaigns is in peril.  With 336 yards in 2024, he'll need to average 95 yards per game in the final seven games. ""The streak, yeah, it's important to us, but he cares about winning,"" Mayfield said. ""He's a huge part of this offense when he's there, so I think that'll come naturally. But I've been in the situation where you're trying to force-feed the ball to a guy and that's not how this offense works especially.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

McCord and the Orange appear to be back on track but will face a stiff test Saturday when Connecticut visits for a nonconference clash. In the Oct. 24 defeat to Pitt, McCord threw three pick-sixes in the first half alone. He did not pass for a touchdown against the Panthers, but since he has thrown five TDs and only one INT while the Orange (7-3) are 2-1 over their last three outings. ""I'm biased, but Kyle McCord's a top-five quarterback in the country,"" Syracuse coach Fran Brown said. ""He don't get beat up about it, he don't complain about it, he's just, 'It is what it is, let's move on to the next thing.' Without him, our program wouldn't be where it's at right now."" McCord passed for 323 yards and a touchdown Saturday at Cal, helping the Orange earn a 33-25 victory. LeQuint Allen ran for 109 yards and two TDs for Syracuse, while the Orange defense grabbed a pair of interceptions en route to a 27-7 halftime lead. ""I'm proud that they came together and played as a full team (in the) last game -- complementary football,"" Brown said. The Huskies (7-3) are coming off a solid game as well, as they rallied with 21 fourth-quarter points to knock off UAB 31-23. Cam Edwards' 48-yard TD run with 2:39 left proved to be the decisive score as UConn won for the sixth time in seven games. However, the Huskies had a bye last weekend, so UConn coach Jim Mora Jr. doesn't expect to receive a ton of momentum from the win over the Blazers. ""That game's 12 days ago, so that's way out of our minds,"" Mora said Tuesday. ""But they're confident because they practiced well today. That's how we try to look at it. ... That's where we're at."" The former Big East Conference rivals have met 12 times over the years.

Coach Kirk Ferentz declined to name either former starter Cade McNamara or former fourth-stringer Jackson Stratton as Sullivan's replacement when asked who would run the offense for Iowa (6-4, 4-3) in College Park, Md. ""Everything's clearly cloudy right now,"" Ferentz said on Tuesday. ""That's our weather forecast."" McNamara, who hasn't played since suffering a concussion in a win over Northwestern on Oct. 26, has been cleared by doctors and is listed first on the depth chart. ""Whether he can play effectively or not, we'll see. We'll just see how the week goes,"" Ferentz said of McNamara. Iowa had been on an upswing with Sullivan, who had sparked the Hawkeyes to convincing wins over Northwestern and Wisconsin before suffering an ankle injury in a 20-17 loss at UCLA on Nov. 8. Ferentz said it's possible Sullivan could return for a bowl game. Another storyline for Saturday is that Ferentz will be opposing his son, Brian Ferentz, an assistant at Maryland. Brian Ferentz was Iowa's offensive coordinator from 2017-23. ""We've all got business to take care of on Saturday,"" Kirk Ferentz said. ""I think his experience has been good and everything I know about it. As a parent, I'm glad he's with good people."" Maryland (4-6, 1-6) needs a win to keep its hopes alive for a fourth straight bowl appearance under Mike Locksley. The Terrapins have dropped five of their last six games, all by at least 14 points, including a 31-17 loss at home to Rutgers last weekend. ""It's been a challenging last few weeks to say the least,"" Locksley said. The challenge this week will be to stop Iowa running back Kaleb Johnson, who leads the Big Ten in rushing yards (1,328) and touchdowns (20), averaging 7.1 yards per carry. ""With running backs, it's not always about speed. It's about power, vision and the ability to make something out of nothing,"" Locksley said. ""This guy is a load and runs behind his pads."" Maryland answers with quarterback Billy Edwards Jr., who leads the Big Ten in passing yards per game (285.5) and completions (268).

Heim has been a championship contender -- and arguably the best driver in the series -- in his two years in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series with TRICON Garage. Heim won six races in 2024 alone, and advanced to the Championship 4 for the second consecutive season.  While Herbst has put up solid numbers during his time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, a best points finish of seventh and just three wins over five full-time seasons don't come close to matching Heim's numbers.  Heim's ceiling seems to be much higher than Herbst's, and at 22 years old compared to the 25-year-old Herbst, Heim has more potential to grow as a young driver.  You might find it surprising, then, that when 23XI announced the driver of their third car on Wednesday, it was Herbst that was tapped for the job.  The reason comes in the form of green rectangles.  No disrespect is meant toward Herbst, but it's no secret that his family's business relationships have played a big part in furthering his career. When put up against Heim, the numbers just don't add up from a statistical standpoint -- but the figures in the bank do.  Herbst's longtime sponsor in Monster Energy -- a company that's been tied to 23XI since 2022 -- will join him, sponsoring his No. 35 Toyota Camry XSE during his first Cup Series campaign.  There's an old saying that perfectly encapsulates the situation 23XI found itself in: Money talks and, well, you know the rest.  It's not Herbst's fault that 23XI's decision boiled down the sponsorship dollars -- an asset Heim doesn't bring to the same degree. The business model of NASCAR and its teams has always been dependent on sponsors. It was reportedly a lack of funding that led to Anthony Alfredo leaving Our Motorsports at the end of this season, and it was funding that led the team to sign Kris Wright on Wednesday morning.  If a blue-chip prospect such as Heim exhibits extraordinary talent but doesn't bring sponsorship dollars to the team, their chances of getting the ride over a relatively ordinary prospect who brings plenty of funding to the table is very slim.  It's a model of finding drivers who bring the most money rather than finding the best driver.  That's exactly the situation Heim finds himself in now. Herbst was considered a very talented prospect who might find himself a Cup Series ride with a lower-level team. If that didn't pan out, he could've stayed in the NASCAR Xfinity Series.  While Heim toils in the Truck Series for another season, Herbst will have a chance to prove his critics wrong and quell doubts that he doesn't have what it takes to be successful in the Cup Series. If his rookie season doesn't produce results, however, don't be shocked if 23XI bites the financial bullet and gives Heim his shot.  --Samuel Stubbs, Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Or perhaps that should be the Pac-2 championship. With 10 teams bolting for other conferences this fall, the Cougars (8-2) and Beavers (4-6) are all that's left of the Pac-12. That makes Saturday's showdown the lone conference game of the season. There seemingly was a camaraderie that developed between the two schools as they've tried to keep the brand alive. But WSU coach Jake Dickert isn't buying the friendly territory chatter as the Cougars hit the road.  ""First thing, I've never gotten into, like, they're our buddy. Oregon State's not our buddy. They would have left us as fast as we would have left them. This is what it is. It's one of our biggest rivals now,"" Dickert said. ""That's the way I looked at it.

The Cougars dropped out of the College Football Playoff race with a stunning 38-35 loss at New Mexico on Saturday. The loss wasted a peak performance from quarterback John Mateer completing 25 of 36 passes for 375 yards and four touchdowns. The Beavers have lost five consecutive games, including a 28-0 defeat Saturday at Air Force. ""When you lose like we've lost the last five weeks, it's never just one thing, and it's certainly not just the players,"" Beavers coach Trent Bray said. ""Absolutely, I challenge myself and the coaches to come up with a better way to get these guys to perform at the level we know."" The Beavers' biggest problem is at quarterback. Transfer Gevani McCoy has started eight of nine games, but has twice as many interceptions (six) as touchdown passes (three) and was benched at halftime last week for freshman Gabarri Johnson. Junior Ben Gulbranson has starting experience but missed last week's game with an injury. ""It's hard to get a beat and a pulse on them,"" Dickert said. ""I'm sure that's what they're feeling a little bit offensively too, as well, and who gives them the best chance of winning. We'll prepare for all three (QBs)."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The winner will play the victor of the earlier game putting Drake against Miami on Friday, with the losers battling in the consolation round. Both Oklahoma State and FAU have new coaches this season and are still trying to get fundamentals and nuances in place in the coaches' respective schemes. The Cowboys (3-0) head to the tournament on the heels of an 85-78 home win over Southern Illinois last Thursday. Two of their bench players, Abou Ousmane and Brandon Newman, each scored 18 points to help Oklahoma State to a 57-19 edge in scoring from its reserves. Marchelus Avery added 11 points and Bryce Thompson tallied 10 for the Cowboys. The game was tied at 49-49 with 13:33 to play before Oklahoma State fashioned a 27-9 run over the ensuing six-plus minutes. Southern Illinois closed to within four points with 24 seconds left before running out of steam. ""We need to learn how to finish,"" Oklahoma State coach Steve Lutz said. ""We get away from playing winning basketball and put ourselves in a bind a little bit. Some of that is just ill-advised shots or just lack of communication and getting matched up defensively."" The Owls (3-2) head back to Charleston after earning the consolation championship in the Field of 68 tournament with a 77-74 overtime win over Liberty on Saturday. Matas Vokietaitis led FAU with career-high 17 points, while Leland Walker had 16 and Kaleb Glenn and Niccolo Moretti each scored 12. The Owls bounced back from a double-overtime loss on Friday to host Charleston and snapped a two-game losing streak.

Holloway hopes to see his team combine both elements Thursday against VCU (4-0) in the opening round of the Charleston Classic in South Carolina. ""When you come in with a new group, the first thing you gotta do is establish something,"" Holloway said. ""And in this culture, it's our defense, so that's what I established this summer with them."" After taking a pair of one-point losses to Fordham and Hofstra, the Pirates allowed 23.9 percent shooting in its 54-28 rout of Wagner on Saturday in their on-campus gym. Despite the defense emerging quicker than an offense that is shooting 38.4 percent, Chaunce Jenkins is averaging 14.8 points so far after transferring from Old Dominion. He scored 16 against Wagner and has been in double figures three times. ""We've still got to sharpen up our offense,"" Jenkins said. ""Obviously we've got 10 new guys and we're still learning each other offensively."" VCU (4-0) will represent the most potent offense Seton Hall has faced yet, as the perennial Atlantic 10 stalwart is averaging 77.5 points so far with four double-digit wins.  The Rams posted their most lopsided win on Saturday when they rolled to an 83-57 defeat of Loyola Maryland. Jack Clark scored 25 points, Joe Bamisile added 22 and Max Shulga finished with 20 to become the school's first trio to score at least 20 in the same game in 14 years. Bamisile has scored at least 18 in each game so far. Clark had his big game after scoring 26 in his first three games and Shulga scored 20 after going 2-of-12 in his previous two contests. Seton Hall represents a step up in competition for the Rams. ""They're a well-coached team who's really hungry and a tough matchup for anybody,"" VCU coach Ryan Odom said.

However, Hurricanes coach Jim Larranaga acknowledges that the size of his guards -- Pack is 6-foot and Blackmon is 6-2 -- could be exploited as Miami's schedule becomes more imposing. ""The challenge for (Blackmon) is going to be on the defensive end because he plays next to Nijel,"" Larranaga said. ""Neither one of them is a big guard. It's something we're going to have to handle as the season progresses."" Miami has a standout at center in Lynn Kidd, a 6-10, 241-pound transfer from Virginia Tech. He is averaging 14.0 points and 6.0 rebounds and ranks eighth in the nation in field-goal percentage (.783). The Hurricanes start two veteran forwards: Matthew Cleveland (11.0 points, 6.0 rebounds) and Brandon Johnson (10.3 points, team-high 8.0 rebounds). While Miami has been cruising, Drake won its most recent game by just two points over Florida Gulf Coast. Drake made three of the last four NCAA Tournaments, but coach Darian DeVries left for West Virginia and the Bulldogs had to replace all five starters from last season's 28-7 squad. New coach Ben McCollum built a Division II power at Northwest Missouri State, which went 29-5 last season. Four players from that team are now starting for Drake: Isaiah Jackson, Bennett Stirtz, Mitch Mascari and Daniel Abreu. The fifth starter is Wyoming transfer Cam Manyawu. The only returner from last season is forward Nate Ferguson, a sixth-year senior who is Drake's sixth man. Manyawu, who won't turn 19 until New Year's Day, tops Drake in rebounds (6.7). Stirtz leads the team in scoring (18.7), assists (5.0) and steals (3.0). He also scored a game-high 25 points against Florida Gulf Coast on a night in which the Bulldogs were not sharp.

Jeanty, the nation's leading rusher, helped the Broncos (9-1, 6-0 Mountain West) overcome a slow start and post their eighth straight win, 42-21 at San Jose State last week. Jeanty compiled a game-high 159 rushing yards and three touchdowns while Maddux Madsen completed 22 of 30 passes for 256 yards and a touchdown.

But being able to go from that starting point to finish the game on a 42-7 run, that is a testament to these kids."" With 1,893 rushing yards, Jeanty broke the previous Boise State rushing record held by Jay Ajayi (1,823) since 2014. It was also the 10th straight 100-yard rushing game for the junior running back, breaking the Mountain West record set in 2016 by former San Diego State running back Donnel Pumphrey.  ""Ashton Jeanty continues to be the best football player in the country,"" Danielson said.

The Cowboys (2-8, 2-4) lost a rivalry trophy road game at Colorado State 24-10 last week. The teams play The Border War annually for the Bronze Boot.  Kaden Anderson hit 13 of 30 passes for 120 yards and had a rushing touchdown. Jamari Ferrell rushed for 74 yards on just six carries, while Wyoming only had nine first downs and 237 yards of total offense.  First-year coach Jay Sawvel elevated Anderson to starting quarterback after the Cowboys' 1-7 start. The move paid immediate dividends in a 49-45 win against New Mexico on Nov. 2. ""Look, there's a lot of things that go into this,"" Sawvel said. ""We have not established momentum in our season because of losing close games at home."" The Cowboys won't qualify for a bowl game, so they are relegated to playing spoiler against a team for which Sawvel had high praise. ""This is probably the best Mountain West team that I've seen in the five years that I've been in this conference coming here this week,"" Sawvel said.

Wide receiver Jack Bech has 982 receiving yards, with 16 catches going for at least 20 yards. He has nine touchdown catches.    Arizona (4-6, 2-5) ended a five-game losing streak Friday night with a 27-3 home win over Houston to keep alive its bowl hopes. But the Wildcats will have to pivot this week from playing against the worst passing team in the Big 12.    The Wildcats came up with three turnovers and four fourth-down stops against Houston, but they are playing without three key defenders due to season-ending injuries - defensive backs Treydan Stukes and Gunner Maldonado, and linebacker Jacob Manu.    The Wildcats tweaked some things offensively last week, inserting Joey Capra as the new right tackle, increasing the use of five-receiver sets and relying more on quarterback Noah Fifita to deliver quick passes.    ""We've been really diligent the last couple of weeks of putting him on the clock every play and giving him that feedback in practice in the moment,"" coach Brent Brennan said of Fifita.

He had been slowed by a nagging foot injury. Mississippi State has allowed 40-plus points four times this season but allowed just 13 second-half points to explosive Tennessee during a 33-14 road loss in their most recent game on Nov. 9. The Bulldogs rushed for 179 yards with a 4.7 average in that game, with Davon Booth gaining 125 yards on 20 carries.  ""They've been really effective running the football, really, the last four weeks,"" Drinkwitz said. Michael Van Buren Jr. has passed for 1,415 yards and nine touchdowns. But he has also thrown five interceptions and been sacked 22 times. Missouri will focus much of its attention on Kevin Coleman Jr, who has caught 62 passes for 756 yards and five touchdowns.  ""Dynamic wide receiver, really good route-runner, really good yards after catch,"" Drinkwitz. ""As challenging a wide receiver as there is in the SEC, in my opinion."" Mississippi State still is in the early program-building stages with first-year coach Jeff Lebby.  ""As we finish this up, they were part of laying the foundation in Year 1 and giving us the ability to build something to sustain,"" Lebby said. ""That's why it's so important to play our best is for these older guys."" The Bulldogs had extra practice time during their bye week to prepare for the Tigers. ""We have an opportunity to finish the way we need to finish,"" Lebby said. ""Creating that vision and that understanding with these last two games on the schedule is an unbelievable opportunity. It's a really good (Missouri) team at home this weekend. For us, that was the focus, handling what we have a chance to handle, and finding a way to play our best football of the year this Saturday."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But coach Greg McDermott doesn't have to look far to find areas he wants the Bluejays to improve, with a sharp rise in the level of competition around the corner.  Next up for Creighton is its in-state rivalry game against visiting Nebraska on Friday in Omaha, Neb.  Then, the Bluejays will travel to Las Vegas for the inaugural Players Era Festival, where they'll play San Diego State, No. 23 Texas A&M and a third opponent to be determined that could also carry a national ranking. No. 1 Kansas will come to Omaha in early December, as well.  After the Bluejays (4-0) beat Kansas City 79-56 last Saturday, McDermott was asked for his assessment of where his group stands through two weeks of the regular season.  ""Not even close to where we need to be, I don't think,"" he said. ""I think we're moving that way. I don't think everybody understands how ready we need to be next Friday night and then jumping on a plane Sunday to head to Vegas for those three games. We don't get a breath the rest of the season now.""  One issue McDermott harped on was boxing out. Although Creighton outrebounded Kansas City 52-34, the coach was unhappy that the Roos managed to get 12 offensive rebounds. He also has an eye on the Bluejays' shot selection and making sure they get the shot they want every trip up the floor, though the team has made 52.3 percent from the field this season.  A big reason for that is center Ryan Kalkbrenner, who kicked off the season with a 49-point game on 20-for-22 shooting against UT Rio Grande Valley. He hasn't come close to replicating that outburst since, but Kalkbrenner is tied for fourth in Division I with 25.8 points per game and third in the country at 89.1 percent shooting. For the first time this season, Kalkbrenner wasn't the leading scorer for Creighton against Kansas City. Freshman wing Jackson McAndrew came off the bench for 15 points, 3-of-4 shooting from deep and seven rebounds in 16 minutes, while all five starters scored between nine and 14 points. McDermott's team was well-prepared for last year's edition of the rivalry game, throttling Nebraska 89-60 on the road. But Nebraska turned the tables on its last trip to Omaha in a 63-53 win on Dec. 4, 2022. The Cornhuskers (3-1) hung tough with Saint Mary's on Sunday before losing 77-74 in a neutral-site game in South Dakota. After falling behind by 10 with roughly four minutes to play, Nebraska stormed back to within one point. The Huskers forced Saint Mary's to the line, Mikey Lewis made both his free throws and Brice Williams missed his 3-point try at the buzzer that would have forced overtime. Williams still finished with 28 points, his highest total in two seasons at Nebraska. He went 11-for-11 from the foul line and agreed after the game that the physicality resembled a Big Ten matchup. ""We have a lot of growing to do, but we're just taking steps every night to get better,"" Williams said. ""From the first exhibition game, we've taken steps, we've gotten better, we have developed a little bit more chemistry."" Williams leads the Cornhuskers with 18.8 points per game, while Juwan Gary provides 10.5 points, 2.0 assists and 2.5 steals per contest. Creighton forward Mason Miller, who has missed the past two games with an undisclosed injury, could return this week, McDermott said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Gamecocks (7-3) have to win their last two games and get plenty of help to leapfrog any of the Southeastern Conference schools currently ranked ahead of them: No. 3 Texas, No. 7 Alabama, No. 9 Ole Miss, No. 10 Georgia, No. 11 Tennessee and No. 15 Texas A&M. Since losing at Alabama on Oct. 12, South Carolina has won four games in a row, with three of them against AP or CFP ranked opponents. Most recently, the Gamecocks took down Missouri at home last Saturday, 34-30, behind a career-high five passing touchdowns from LaNorris Sellers. Raheim Sanders hauled in Sellers' go-ahead touchdown pass, a 15-yard shovel toss -- with 15 seconds left. It was the first time since 2012, when Steve Spurrier coached the Gamecocks, that they have won four consecutive SEC games. For his efforts, Sellers -- a redshirt freshman from Florence, S.C. -- was named SEC Offensive Player of the Week and the Walter Camp National Offensive Player of the Week. He has piled up more than 2,200 yards of total offense this season and thrown 14 touchdowns to five interceptions. ""He's just a really good quarterback, and he continues to get better every week,"" Gamecocks coach Shane Beamer said of Sellers. Outside of tight end Brady Hunt being out for at least two weeks with a lower body injury, Beamer didn't have many updates to his injury report. Defensive back Judge Collier ""should be fine"" and left tackle Josiah Thompson ""is back healthy,"" Beamer said. The game marks the final one of the season for Wofford (5-6), which has played five games against Top 25 teams in the FCS this season, winning just one. The Terriers, who carry 37 players on their roster from the state of South Carolina, are coming off a 31-17 home loss to The Citadel, which plays at Clemson this week. ""The bottom line is, you can't turn the ball over, you can't give up big plays, and you've got to get off the field on third down,"" Wofford coach Shawn Watson said after the Terriers blew a halftime lead. ""For us, right now, I'm just trying to move our program forward and get our football team better."" Ryan Ingram leads Wofford's offense this season with 650 rushing yards and six touchdowns, while wideout Kyle Watkins has 43 catches for 689 yards. South Carolina is paying Wofford a $600,000 guarantee for this game. The Gamecocks are 20-4 all-time against the Terriers with 17 straight wins. This is the final home game of the season for South Carolina before its regular season finale at rival Clemson. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Clemson (8-2, 7-1) has concluded its ACC slate and must wait to see what happens with No. 8 Miami (9-1, 5-1) and No. 13 SMU (9-1, 6-0), who both have two league games remaining. The Tigers can't afford to be distracted against The Citadel (5-6), which arrives in Clemson, S.C., after winning three of its last four games. The Bulldogs scored 20 unanswered points to rally past Wofford, 30-17, last Saturday.  ""This is their last game, you know, this is it for them,"" Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said. ""This isn't a game where you know they got a game next week and they've got to you know be smart with some guys. This is a game where they got really nothing to lose, so you know you expect probably every trick in the book."" The Citadel is out of bowl contention and sit sixth in the Southern Conference but its win over Wofford showed the military-like discipline that the school preaches. The Citadel held the ball for 35:47, dominating the second half and keeping the Terriers off the scoreboard. ""It's no secret we want to play and I use that word 'boring' football,"" coach Maurice Drayton said. ""We want the ball. We want to be methodical down the field. We want to take our time, so to speak, and that will be everything this week coming up. It's going to shorten the game, one.

The Citadel's Johnathan Bennett threw for 166 yards for two touchdowns and ran for 41 yards against Wofford. He leads an offense ranked No. 15 in the FCS with 13.48 yards per pass completion. He'll have to watch out for a Clemson defensive line that has improved since the Tigers fell to Louisville on Nov. 2 ""As awful as we were in the Louisville game, they've really, I mean they've played well these past two weeks,"" Swinney said. ""It's really good to see those guys step up."" Since then, Clemson held Virginia Tech and Pitt to a combined 128 rushing yards. In a 24-20 victory over the Panthers last Saturday, the Tigers had 16 tackles for a loss and eight sacks. Of those sacks, four came from defensive end T.J. Parker. ""He went from a third-down player to where he can play first and second down,"" Swinney said. ""He understands run fits, he understands more about what's going on offensively. He's bigger, stronger. He can hold up physically as opposed to where he was last year.""

The No. 7 Crimson Tide and the Sooners will square off for the first time as Southeastern Conference rivals on Saturday in Norman, Okla. Alabama (8-2, 4-2 SEC) is riding a three-game winning streak that has put Kalen DeBoer's team back into playoff contention. The Sooners (5-5, 1-5) have dropped four consecutive conference games to put their 25-season bowl streak into danger. Turnovers figure to play a significant role on Saturday. The Crimson Tide are tied for fourth nationally in turnover margin at plus-13, while the Sooners are tied for 72nd at minus-one. Alabama has forced three or more turnovers in each of its last five games, including nine interceptions. Oklahoma has turned the ball over a total of 13 times over its last five games. On Tuesday, Sooners coach Brent Venables pointed out the scoring margin off turnovers in his team's wins versus its losses. Oklahoma is outscoring opponents 63-6 off turnovers in its wins and being outscored 58-7 off turnovers in its losses. ""When you take care of the ball, again, good things will usually happen,"" Venables said. Crimson Tide quarterback Jalen Milroe presents a unique challenge for the Sooners. He is averaging 223.2 passing yards and 60.8 rushing yards per game. He's thrown for 15 touchdowns with just six interceptions and has rushed for 17 scores. ""He's, I think, back in a really good spot with trust in the guys around him,"" DeBoer said. ""There's been a little more continuity with the practice, skill players, offensive line. ... He's become more comfortable in understanding what our team needs from him to be able to win SEC football games."" The Sooners aren't nearly as settled at quarterback, although sophomore Jackson Arnold will make his fourth consecutive start since regaining the role in mid-October. Arnold fumbled three times -- losing two -- in the Sooners' 30-23 loss to Missouri on Nov. 9 heading into a bye week. One of those fumbles came near the end of the game and was returned for what ultimately was the game-winning touchdown. ""I can't fumble like that,"" Arnold said. ""Can't turn the ball over but at the same time, we've got two more games. We've got two more great teams we've got to play so we've got to put it behind us and move forward."" Arnold is hoping to have a couple targets back as a bigger part of the offense Saturday. Wide receivers Jalil Farooq and Deion Burks returned after long absences against Missouri. Burks finished with five catches for 44 yards while Farooq had two receptions for 11 yards. Venables said both could see more action against Alabama. ""They had to knock off a little bit of rust,"" Venables said. ""Certainly the volume, their play capacity wasn't what it would normally be. ... We're hoping that will continue to improve as we move forward."" DeBoer said this week that Crimson Tide starting safety Keon Sabb was out for the season after undergoing surgery. The Tide and the Sooners have met six times previously, with the last coming in December 2018 in a College Football Playoff semifinal. Alabama recorded a 45-34 win. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

If they win their last two -- including a home contest against Oklahoma State on Nov. 29 -- they will play in the Big 12 Championship Game on Dec. 7 for a spot in the College Football Playoff. But first things first. The Buffaloes likely will have their hands full with the Jayhawks (4-6, 3-4), who have won two straight games against ranked teams for the first time in school history. A week after knocking off Iowa State at Arrowhead, the Jayhawks handed BYU its first loss of the season on Saturday night with a 17-13 decision in Provo, Utah. ""I feel like our team has always done a great job being able to stay the course,"" quarterback Jalon Daniels said. ""I feel like a big staple within our program is being able to trust the process."" The Jayhawks' bowl chances seemed all-but done after they lost to Kansas State on Oct. 26 to fall to 2-6 overall. But if they knock off the Buffaloes and then win at Baylor on Nov. 30, they'll be bowl eligible. ""I have a lot of respect for Coach Sanders,"" Kansas coach Lance Leipold said Monday. ""The thing we have in common is that we've come up through the ranks. He's found a way to be successful using his own philosophy. He's built a college football team that's one of the most improved in college football in a very short period of time. ""They're a very talented team that's playing with a lot of confidence."" The Jayhawks' victory over BYU was a defensive struggle, which snapped a streak of six straight games of scoring at least 27 points. The Buffaloes have been scoring a lot of points in their four-game winning streak. They scored 34 points in back-to-back games before scoring 41 at Texas Tech and 49 against Utah last Saturday. Still, Sanders wasn't completely satisfied. ""We haven't even put it all together yet,"" Sanders said at his postgame news conference. ""Like we haven't even played our best game. That should be in itself scary. When I said (when he was hired at Colorado), 'We comin.' We still coming. We never stopped coming. We are coming, and we ain't nearly there yet."" Now, with the Jayhawks in their sights, Sanders isn't going to take anything for granted. ""They're tough, they're physical, they play a consistent game,"" Sanders said. ""That quarterback gives you problems because he's very versatile. The defense can take the ball away interception-wise and they have not given up -- regardless of what the record may state -- the last two weeks. They've knocked some people off their feet. It's going to be a tremendous task for us."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

BYU was picked to finish 13th and Arizona State 16th (last) in the Big 12 in a preseason media poll.

""To have this game be something with a lot of meaning is really cool at this point."" Arizona State coach Kenny Dillingham believes the game is significant enough that he urged fans not to sell tickets to BYU supporters.

Sitake called Arizona State running back Cam Skattebo one of the best in the nation at his position.

""Well, obviously Georgia has a very good win at Texas,"" Manuel said of why the committee sees a significant gap between Texas and Georgia. ""As the committee analyzed the body of work of Texas versus where Georgia is at the present time with two losses, even to Top-25 teams, we came out that Texas was still a very strong team deserving of a 3 seed."" Smart is not clear on what the ""eye test"" entails.  ""It just seems unjust to me when you evaluate somebody's got a third-ranked defense or somebody's got a fifth-ranked defense,"" Smart said. ""Well, don't you think that third- or fifth-ranked defense (ranking) is dictated by who they've played on offense and how many top offenses they've played?  ""Because last time I checked, our offense and our defense have played the top offenses and defenses across the country. Well, you're not going to be ranked as high if you play top ones than if you play lower-ranked ones, and that's what gets me is they talk about the eye test."" Ohio State is No. 1 in scoring defense, ahead of Notre Dame (third), Texas (fourth) and Ole Miss (fifth). Ohio State is fourth in run defense, two spots behind Ole Miss and one ahead of Penn State.  Indiana is No. 2 in scoring offense behind Miami with the two teams that beat Georgia this season, Ole Miss (fourth) and Alabama (eighth), in the Top 10. ""How do you play in the game? Well, how you play in the game is dictated, No. 1, by where you're playing -- home or away -- and No. 2, who you're playing. That's the two No. 1 indicators of how you play is who you're playing,"" Smart said. ""Who you line up across from matters. But point differential, I don't know that I believe they actually look at just that. I don't know if that's actually the case.  ""They're looking at the whole picture of how you play, and that's dictated by who you play."" LSU head coach Brian Kelly said on the teleconference that the 2024 season was accepted as one that would produce a flawed sample the committee could adjust to in future years. Not only because of the expansion from a four-team playoff to 12, but because of the expansion of the four remaining football power conferences.  ""I think it's going to be heavily decided on schedule. And I think that we're going to get that historical lesson this year,"" Kelly said. ""But I think strength of schedule is going to play a major role ultimately in how this shapes itself moving forward."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""Whenever the ball is in my hands,"" he said, ""I can make a play with it."" Becht will try to keep making those plays on Saturday night when the 22nd-ranked Cyclones bid to keep their Big 12 Conference championship hopes alive in Salt Lake City against struggling Utah. After losing two straight games to fall behind BYU (9-1, 6-1) and Colorado (8-2, 6-1) in the conference, Iowa State (8-2, 5-2) needed Becht to make plays to get back on track. He threw a third-quarter touchdown to put the Cyclones ahead for good at 17-10 and added a fourth-quarter scoring run after the Bearcats trimmed their deficit to three points. Becht completed 24 of 33 passes for 234 yards while adding 48 yards on seven rushes. He comes into this week's game with 2,628 passing yards and 17 touchdowns. What Becht gets on Saturday night likely will be earned. The Utes (4-6, 1-6) have dropped six straight games but the defense hasn't been responsible for much of it, save for last week's 49-24 defeat at Colorado. Shedeur Sanders carved Utah up for 340 passing yards and three touchdowns in its first bad game of the year defensively. The Utes gave up an average of 20.4 points over their first five losses but simply haven't been able to score enough to help their defense. ""This is, bar none, the best defense that we'll play,"" Iowa State coach Matt Campbell said. ""You look at their front seven, all fifth- and sixth-year seniors, some of the best defensive players in the country at their position."" But Utah's offense simply hasn't been competent since veteran quarterback Cam Rising suffered an injury in a September win over Baylor that sidelined him for three games. Rising then was knocked out in his return game at Arizona State on Oct. 11 with what turned out to be a season-ending injury. Freshman Isaac Wilson has showed flashes of brilliance from time to time but simply hasn't played with the consistency needed to win at this level. ""Right now, I'm in the 'Twilight Zone.' It's the most difficult year of my coaching career, hands down,"" Utes coach Kyle Whittingham said. ""Not even close."" Wilson has thrown for 1,436 yards and 10 touchdowns but also has tossed 11 interceptions and completed only 54.8 percent of his attempts. Aside from running back Micah Bernard and his 880 rushing yards, the offense is starved for consistent production. Picked to win the Big 12 in July, Utah must win this week and next week at UCF just to qualify for a bowl game. ""We're just not potent enough on offense,"" Whittingham said. While the Utes scrape out 22.7 points and 353.8 yards per game, Iowa State is averaging 31.4 and 434.2, respectively. The Cyclones own a 4-1 lead in the all-time series but the teams haven't played since 2010, when Utah went to Ames and scored a 68-27 victory. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

He played 22 offensive snaps in the loss at Buffalo before sustaining the injury on the final play of the first quarter.

Pinellas County commissioners late Tuesday agreed to delay a vote on issuing bonds to pay for its portion of a new $1.3 billion ballpark in St. Petersburg, putting off the vote until Dec. 17. Commissioner Brian Scott, who supports the county funding as outlined in a deal made in July, made a motion to delay the vote because he sensed the issue would go down to defeat on Tuesday. Two new commissioners elected in the Nov. 5 election are believed to oppose the deal, and they replaced two that had supported it. ""Hopefully that will allow some time for our new commissioners to get up to speed on this,"" Scott told the Tampa Bay Times of the delay. Commissioner Rene Flowers was the lone dissenter in the 6-1 vote to delay the financing discussion, and she told the newspaper that she doesn't see it passing. ""I just felt that instead of, you know, having additional conversations and taking up time, let's just be forthright and let's just put our responses on the table and stand flat-footed,"" she said. ""I don't believe that additional time will change their minds."" The vote previously had been delayed because of Hurricanes Helene and Milton.  The outcome of the meeting left the Rays reeling. Earlier Tuesday, the club delivered a letter to the commissioners, informing them that the current financial terms for the stadium no longer were viable and that a new solution needed to be reached. In the letter, club presidents Brian Auld and Matt Silverman said the commission's failure to approve the financing by this point has set back the planned 2028 move-in to the ballpark, forcing the team to halt construction plans for the stadium and surrounding area. ""As we have informed the county administrator and St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch, the county's failure to finalize the bonds last month ended the ability for a 2028 delivery of the ballpark,"" the letter read. ""As we have made clear at every step of this process, a 2029 ballpark delivery would result in significantly higher costs that we are not able to absorb alone."" While team officials attended the commission meeting, they made no comment. Instead, they gave their reaction to the latest events in the letter. ""The Rays organization is saddened and stunned by this unfortunate turn of events. We have put in decades of work and spent more than $50 million to bring this historic project to reality -- a project that had been approved by the City of St. Petersburg and Pinellas County. Now, that enormous investment of human and financial capital has been jeopardized by the county's failure to live up to its July agreement."" Welch, in a statement to the Times, said he believes the July deal is still valid and the city ""will continue to work with our partners towards that successful outcome."" Pinellas County commissioners approved $312.5 million in public financing via a tourist tax in July, funded initially by bonds, but in October delayed the bond vote. The reason given was uncertainty as to where the Rays would play next season after the roof at Tropicana Field was shredded by Hurricane Milton. The Rays will play their home games in 2025 at the New York Yankees' spring training complex in Tampa. ""While we are focused on preparing for a unique 2025 season, we stand ready to work on a new solution with any and all willing partners to preserve the future of Major League Baseball in Tampa Bay for generations to come,"" Auld and Silverman wrote in the letter. The next test for the ballpark comes Thursday, when the St. Petersburg City Council is scheduled to vote on selling its own bonds to pay for its share of the stadium, area roads and sewers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Volunteers (8-2) will close out their home slate Saturday afternoon with what will likely be an easier matchup, facing Conference USA foe UTEP (2-8) in Knoxville, Tenn. The Volunteers are looking to rebound from a 31-17 drubbing at the hands of Georgia last Saturday. Tennessee sprinted out of the gate and led 10-0 after the first quarter, however coach Kirby Smart's team found its footing and steamrolled the Volunteers. ""It's an opportunity for us to grow as a football team and continue to get better,"" Tennessee coach Josh Heupel said of facing the Miners on Senior Day. ""It's the next step forward for us."" Heupel said his players are good enough and have the type of culture to put an eighth straight setback against Georgia behind them. ""They made last week a big game because of what they've invested,"" he said. ""We're in the arena and we've got to go make it happen. ... There are areas we've got to get better. ""There are just too many instances of Tennessee hurting Tennessee on Saturday, and that's not taking anything away from Georgia. But the things that we can control, we've got to be better at."" The bad news for the Volunteers was they were tabbed 11th in the rankings, trailing fellow SEC members No. 7 Alabama, No. 9 Ole Miss and No. 10 Georgia. Tennessee will close out its season against in-state rival Vanderbilt on the road in Nashville next Saturday. The Miners have not been in many positions where they led from the outset or had a chance to win, but they did two weeks ago against Kennesaw State in a game that went past regulation. In the second overtime, Kenny Odom caught a 16-yard pass from Skyler Locklear as UTEP earned a 43-35 double overtime win over the Owls. Locklear fired four touchdown passes, Odom caught three of them and UTEP's ""Orange Swarm"" defense forced three straight incompletions to end the contest. That performance earned Locklear the conference's Offensive Player of the Week honors, while Kory Chapman was honored as the Conference USA Defensive Player of the Week. Lockler has completed 67.0 percent of his passes with nine touchdowns and five interceptions this season. Odom, in turn, has 642 receiving yards and seven touchdown receptions. The team has found itself in tight games lately: The last four outcomes -- two wins and two losses -- have all been decided by single digits. ""I'm so proud of this team, and I've been talking about perseverance all year,"" UTEP coach Scotty Walden said after the Senior Day/Homecoming win. ""That's exactly what they did; they persevered through adversity. ... We played with a lot of pride and a lot of passion.""

Georgia (8-2, 6-2 Southeastern Conference) climbed two spots in Tuesday's College Football Playoff rankings after its 31-17 win over the Volunteers last Saturday. On the heels of a 28-10 loss at Ole Miss on Nov. 9, the Bulldogs outscored Tennessee 31-7 over the final three quarters. Georgia quarterback Carson Beck delivered a much-needed 347-yard, two-touchdown performance in the win. Beck, who had thrown nine interceptions in his previous four games, was turnover-free Saturday for the first time since Oct. 5.  ""This team's been in some tough situations this year,"" Georgia head coach Kirby Smart said. ""And they've never cowered down from those opportunities. They've shown resiliency, and they've battled back."" After wrapping up its conference slate, the Bulldogs still need help in qualifying for the SEC Championship Game. Entering Saturday, Georgia sits behind a pair of one-conference loss teams in No. 3 Texas and No. 15 Texas A&M. The Bulldogs are tied with No. 7 Alabama and No. 9 Ole Miss in the loss column but would lose the tiebreaker to each of those teams. Smart dismissed the idea of worrying about hypotheticals ahead of Saturday's matchup. ""The focus is on UMass,"" Smart said. ""I mean, it really is. So, why would I put energy or time into trying to figure out what the best pathway is, including the SEC Championship, when I'm worried about UMass? I just don't think it's a quality conversation."" Georgia and Smart hope to see the injury bug go away. Leading rusher Trevor Etienne (477 rushing yards, seven touchdowns) was sidelined against Tennessee with a rib injury, while wide receiver Dillon Bell (405 receiving yards, four touchdowns) left last week's game with an ankle injury. ""No update on Dillon really,"" Smart said. ""He's got an ankle sprain. It's stable. It's not going to require any kind of surgery or anything. So, we're hopeful to get him back, and same with Trevor."" UMass (2-8) nearly pulled off its first FBS win of the season last Saturday, however a missed an extra point in overtime proved large in its 35-34 home loss to Liberty. Two days later, the school fired head coach Don Brown after compiling a 6-28 record in two-plus years in his second stint with the program. Offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Shane Montgomery will take over as interim coach for the Minutemen's last two games of the season. ""We've got two games left, two big games,"" Montgomery said. ""We still have a lot to play for. ... There's two ways you can go from here. You can either feel sorry for yourself and not improve daily, or you can keep improving. If you've watched us the last number of weeks, I think you see a team that seems to be improving. We're excited about going down to Georgia."" UMass, which has played Georgia once before -- a 66-27 loss in the season finale in 2018 -- already has faced off against a pair of SEC teams this season. The Minutemen fell to Missouri 45-3 on Oct. 12, and 45-20 to Mississippi State on Nov. 2.

Head coach Nick Sirianni said Huff should be able to return before the end of the regular season.  He's been bothered by a wrist issue since Nov. 3, hurt during pregame warmups ahead of Philadelphia's win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. He tried to play but was limited to six snaps.  ""I can't say enough of how he battled through all those different things. I really admire the way he battled through and played with that cast on,"" Sirianni said Wednesday. Huff signed a $51 million deal to join the Eagles in free agency after a career-best 10 sacks with the New York Jets in 2023.  The Eagles (8-2) haven't lost since September and have 28 sacks this season with 2.5 from Huff and stronger contributions from his competition at the position. Josh Sweat leads the team with 6.0 sacks and Nolan Smith has 3.5.  Rookie Jalyx Hunt played a season-high 25 snaps at Dallas.

Texas A&M badly needs a win to keep its playoff hopes alive. SMU (9-1), BYU (9-1) and the Aggies are the first three teams on the outside of the playoff field after Tuesday's latest projection. Freshman quarterback Marcel Reed is very aware of what's at stake entering the pivotal stretch. ""Obviously, we're going to go into practice and prepare for this team like it's the biggest game of the year,"" Reed said of Auburn. ""And we got to win out. And this is just another step in the way we want to go."" Reed passed for a season-high 268 yards along with two touchdowns as the Aggies rolled to a 38-3 home win over New Mexico State last weekend. Defensive end Nic Scourton continues to have a big year on the defensive side with 14 tackles for loss, including five sacks. Auburn (4-6, 1-5) doesn't have any playoff scenarios to ponder as the program tries to avoid a fourth consecutive losing season. After the clash with the Aggies, the Tigers close the regular season at Alabama on Nov. 30. But first, Auburn has to beat Texas A&M or the losing season goes into the books. ""Can't wait,"" Tigers coach Hugh Freeze said. ""It'll be a tall task. They're extremely talented. It will be a good test for us."" Auburn will rely on standout running back Jarquez Hunter, who had 102 yards in last week's 48-14 rout of Louisiana-Monroe. Hunter's 11th career 100-yard outing pushed his season total to 1,015 yards. He ranks sixth all-time in Auburn history with 3,185 career rushing yards. Legendary Bo Jackson is No. 1 with 4,303. ""It's very special to me,"" Hunter said of his first 1,000-yard season. ""I tried to work in the offseason, I planned for this moment. I couldn't do it without the help of the O-line, tight ends and receivers doing a great job blocking and making sure I get to where I need to be. ""I executed off their blocks.

Devin Booker scored 33 points on 12-for-23 shooting and Jusuf Nurkic had 14 points and 12 rebounds for the injury-depleted Suns, who have lost five straight.

Purdy only threw a few passes Wednesday and Thursday during the portion of practice open to the media after hurting his right shoulder in last week's loss to the Seattle Seahawks. The 49ers postponed Purdy's usual news conference until Friday as the team is still determining whether he will be able to play against the Packers. “He was still limited today, he didn’t do as much yesterday but did a little bit more today,” coach Kyle Shanahan said Thursday in his weekly interview with the team’s flagship radio station, KNBR. “He went out there and did a little bit then went back in about halfway through and rested up. Hopefully it will be feeling great on Sunday.” Purdy has not missed a start because of an injury since taking over as the 49ers' quarterback in December 2001. If he can't go on Sunday, that would deliver a major blow to his team's playoff hopes. The Niners (5-5) are currently in a three-way tie for second in the NFC West, a game behind first-place Arizona, and have little margin for error if they want to get back to the playoffs after making it to the Super Bowl last season. Purdy has completed 66% of his passes this season for 2,613 yards, 13 TDs, eight interceptions and a 95.9 passer rating that is down significantly from his league-leading mark of 113 in 2023. Purdy isn't the only key player for San Francisco dealing with an injury this week. All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams didn't practice for a second straight day because of an ankle injury. Williams missed practice all of last week with the ankle injury but played against Seattle. Star defensive end Nick Bosa left in the second half against the Seahawks after injuring his left hip and oblique and hasn't practiced this week. Bosa had previously been dealing with injuries to his right hip and oblique. Shanahan has said that both Williams and Bosa won't need to practice this week in order to play on Sunday. Running back Christian McCaffrey, still dealing with Achilles tendinitis, returned to practice Thursday after resting Wednesday. Tight end George Kittle practiced for a second straight day and says he will play this week after missing the Seattle game with a hamstring injury. Receiver Jacob Cowing didn't practice a day after being limited because he was in the concussion protocol. The team will issue its injury report for the game on Friday.  ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The Los Angeles Dodgers star added his third Most Valuable Player award to his collection and first in the National League when he was chosen unanimously by the Baseball Writers' Association of America on Thursday. Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees won the American League award for the second time, also unanimously. Ohtani last year became the first two-time unanimous MVP. He won the AL award in 2021 and 2023 as a two-way star for the Los Angeles Angels and finished second to Judge in 2022 voting.  He didn’t pitch in 2024 following elbow surgery and signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers last December. Ohtani became the first player to reach 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in a season, then helped the Dodgers beat the Yankees in the World Series. “The fact that I knew I wasn’t going to be able to pitch this season just made me focus more on my offensive game and fortunately I was able to produce and get this award,” Ohtani said through a translator. Ohtani sat on a red sofa with his wife and dog Decoy as teammate Clayton Kershaw announced the award on the MLB Network. The Nederlanse kooikerhondje immediately jumped away. Ohtani received all 30 first-place votes and 420 points. New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor was second with 263 points and Arizona second baseman Ketel Marte third with 229.  Judge was a unanimous pick for the first time. Kansas City shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. got all 30 second-place votes for 270 points, and Yankees outfielder Juan Soto was third with 21 third-place votes and 229 points. Ohtani hit .310, stole 59 bases and led the NL with 54 homers and 130 RBIs exclusively as a designated hitter, becoming the first player with 50 or more homers and 50 or more stolen bases in a season. A highlight of the season was during the dog days. Ball in mouth, Decoy delivered the ceremonial first pitch to his owner at Dodger Stadium's home plate before an Aug. 28 game against Baltimore. “The most nerve-wracking game that I had, the most nervous I was when we had that Decoy throw out the first pitch,” he said. Ohtani played the final three games of the World Series with a torn labrum in his left shoulder. Still recovering from right elbow surgery in September 2023, Ohtani had another operation on Nov. 5 to repair the shoulder and has been working on range of motion and started Thursday on core and lower body work. “The goal is to be ready for opening day and that includes hitting and pitching,” Ohtani said. “But we are kind of taking our time."" When Ohtani resumes pitching, could he win MVP and the Cy Young Award in the same year? “That would obviously be great, but right now my focus is just to get to get back healthy, come back stronger, get back on the mound and show everybody what I can do,” Ohtani said. Ohtani became the first primary designated hitter and first player who didn't appear defensively for a single inning to win an MVP. His season started with the revelation longtime interpreter and friend, Ippei Mizuhara had stolen nearly $17 million from the star to fund gambling. Ohtani is the 12th player with three or more MVPs, joining Barry Bonds (seven) and Jimmie Foxx, Joe DiMaggio, Stan Musial, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Mike Schmidt, Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols and Mike Trout (three each). Balloting was conducted before the postseason. “Moving forward, I think now we do have a target on our back,” Ohtani said. “We are going to be expected to maybe even do — possibly even do more.” Judge led the major leagues with 58 homers, 144 RBIs and 133 walks while hitting .322. Witt topped the big leagues with a .332 average, hitting 32 homers with 31 stolen bases and 109 RBIs. Soto batted .288 with 41 homers and 109 RBIs. When Judge won his first MVP award in 2022, he received 28 first-place votes while Ohtani got the other two. Judge had discussed the MVP award with Philadelphia’s Bryce Harper, the NL winner in 2015 and ’21. “I was telling him, `Man, I’m going to try to catch up to you with these MVPs here, man,’” Judge recalled. “He’d say, hopefully, he could stay a couple ahead of me, which I think he’ll do.” When Judge won his first MVP award in 2022, he received 28 first-place votes while Ohtani got the other two. He is the Yankees' 22nd MVP winner, four more than any other team. Judge was hitting .207 with six homers and 18 RBIs through April, then batted .352 with 52 homers and 126 RBIs in 127 games. “March and April were not my friend this year.” Judge said. “Just keep putting in the work and things are going to change. You can’t mope. You can’t feel sorry for yourself. Especially in New York, nobody’s going to feel sorry for you. So you just got to go out there and put up the numbers.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

(AP) — Bryce Underwood, the top-rated football recruit in the country, flipped to Michigan after pledging to play at LSU, a person familiar with the decision said Thursday night. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the recruit's plans to join the Wolverines. Underwood pinned a post on his Instagram account, showing a post from On3.com that reported he has committed to Michigan. The 6-foot-3, 205-pound quarterback played at Belleville High School, which is about 15 miles east of Ann Arbor, and told LSU nearly a year ago that he intended to play there. Underwood and his family wore LSU jewelry in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, earlier this month when Alabama beat the Tigers 42-13. Michigan coach Sherrone Moore, whose debut season has been stunted by the lack of a productive quarterback, continued to recruit Underwood with the help of a name, image and likeness collective, and it paid off. With a player as highly regarded as Underwood, NIL offers can reach $5 million to $10 million. Michigan has partnered with a collective, Champions Circle, to create opportunities for athletes to make money, and the group responded to Underwood's commitment. “ We are very excited to keep Bryce home in Michigan as he continues to build his legacy,” Nate Forbes, founding member and chairman of Champions Circle, said in a statement. Underwood's commitment gives the defending national champion Wolverines a jolt of hope. Michigan (5-5, 3-4 Big Ten) has to beat Northwestern (4-6, 2-5) on Saturday to become bowl eligible before closing the season on the road against second-ranked rival Ohio State. ___ Follow Larry Lage at https://apnews.com/author/larry-lage ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Kelce announced during an appearance on ABC's “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on Thursday night that he will host “They Call It Late Night with Jason Kelce,” on ESPN. The one-hour show will tape on five straight Friday nights beginning Jan. 3. That coincides with the last week of the NFL's regular season and the playoffs. The show will originate in front of a live audience from Union Transfer in Philadelphia. The first four episodes will air at 1 a.m. EST starting on Jan. 4 with the final episode coming on at 1:30 a.m. EST on Feb. 1. “I loved late-night shows, I’ve always loved them. I remember sleepovers watching Conan O’Brien with my friends,” Kelce said on Kimmel's show. “We’re going to have a bunch of guys up there — legends of the game, friends that I played with, coaches, celebrities,” Kelce said. The Philadelphia-based band Snacktime will provide the show's music. The show's title is a homage to “They Call it Pro Football,” which was NFL Films’ first full-length film in 1967. NFL Films originated in Philadelphia and founders Ed and Steve Sabol are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It also featured the legendary voice of John Facenda, who did the news on Philadelphia television before becoming better known as the voice of NFL Films. NFL Films will produce the show in conjunction with Kelce’s Wooderboy Productions and Skydance Sports. Each episode will also be also seen on Replays airing on ESPN2, and also be available on ESPN+, ESPN's YouTube channel and the Jason Kelce channel on YouTube.  Kelce is in the first year of a multi-year agreement with ESPN. He appears on the network's “Monday Night Countdown” show as well as providing halftime and postgame analysis. He played 13 years for the Philadelphia Eagles before retiring at the end of last season and was the most sought-after former player by networks. He participated in last year’s NFL Broadcasting and Media Workshop, which used to be known as the “Broadcast Bootcamp.” Kelce has made news lately, though, for other reasons. He was involved in a confrontation with a fan in State College, Pennsylvania, before the Penn State-Ohio State game on Nov. 2, when a fan heckled Kelce and appeared to shout an anti-gay slur about his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, for dating pop star Taylor Swift. Video showed Kelce grabbing the fan’s phone and throwing it to the ground. Kelce apologized about the incident on ESPN on Nov. 4. On Thursday night an autograph seeker verbally confronted Kelce outside the El Capitan Entertainment Center in Hollywood, where “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” is taped. Video obtained by TMZ shows Kelce explaining that he doesn’t sign autographs for people that follow where he is going. After being shouted at for over two minutes, Kelce eventually got out of the car and signed autographs, including shaking the hand of a man who was berating Kelce with obscenities. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
ABC News: Sports,Spain and tennis having to cope with the retirement of the great Nadal,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/spain-tennis-cope-retirement-great-nadal-116094368,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 10:50:19 -0500",It was an emotional farewell from tennis for Nadal this week after Spain was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup in Malaga,"It was an emotional farewell from tennis for Nadal this week after Spain was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup in Malaga MALAGA, Spain -- As Rafael Nadal prepared to serve in what turned out to be the last tennis match of his career, a woman's voice broke the silence from the stands: “You make Spain proud!” Not long after that, Nadal was wiping away tears from his face and waving goodbye to his fans. His farewell from tennis was as emotional as expected when it came in Malaga on Tuesday, too soon for most. Nadal deliberately set up his swansong on a home court but Spain was eliminated in the Davis Cup quarterfinals and he and they couldn't complete his exalted career with a win. It was also heart-wrenching for his fans across Spain as they saw one of the country’s very best — arguably its greatest sportsperson ever — finally call it quits. “It's clear that Rafa is the best athlete ever in Spain. He is on a different level than everyone else, by far,” Feliciano López, a former tennis player and the tournament director of the Davis Cup Finals, told The Associated Press. “No disrespect to all other Spanish athletes, and we have very good ones, but no one has been able to inspire the fans the same way that Rafa did."" López, who was Nadal’s teammate in the Davis Cup, compared him to the likes of Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali, all athletes who transcended sports. “There is a very small group of athletes who, during their careers, were able to inspire people in a special way, going beyond sports,” López said. “Rafa belongs to this small group. People everywhere in the world will remember Rafa some 40 or 50 years from now.”  Unable to overcome a string of injuries in recent years, the 38-year-old Nadal retired from professional tennis after more than 20 years on tour and 22 Grand Slam titles, two more than Roger Federer and second only to the 24 of Novak Djokovic, the only one of the Big Three still playing. The front pages of Spain’s dailies all talked about Nadal following his farewell match — a 6-4, 6-4 defeat against No. 80 Botic van de Zandschulp of the Netherlands. “It was an honor,” the sports daily AS said. “Thank you, Rafa,” Marca headlined. “Eternal,” Mundo Deportivo said. It's hard to find any other Spanish athlete coming close to Nadal's fame and sporting achievements. Other Spaniards who have earned sporting greatness include five-time major golf champion Seve Ballesteros; five-time Tour de France winner Miguel Induráin, two-time NBA champion Pau Gasol; two-time Formula 1 champion Fernando Alonso; six-time MotoGP champion Marc Márquez; and four-time Dakar Rally winner Carlos Sainz. Spain also has a long list of successful soccer players, including World Cup winners Iker Casillas and Andrés Iniesta, but none with a status like a Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi, who have transcended sports like Nadal. Nadal is also a two-time Olympic champion, and was Spain’s flag-bearer during the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro. He is adored in Spain just as much for his victories as he is for his passion and unwavering dedication, and is seen as an example for society in general for his values and humbleness on and off the courts. “Nadal makes us Spaniards feel proud. He represents the values of passion, camaraderie, solidarity. He will always be the image of sport in Spain,"" said Clara García, a 35-year-old fan who was in Malaga to watch Nadal. “It's not easy knowing that he won't be playing and representing Spain on the courts around the world anymore.” Federer gushed about his friend and longtime foe's retirement in an open letter. “You made Spain proud, you made the whole tennis world proud. You have always been a role model for kids around the world.” Nadal told the crowd in his farewell ceremony after Spain's loss that he always ""strived to be better and achieve my goals from a place of respect, humility, and I valued all the good things that happened to me. “I’ve tried to be a good person, which was what mattered the most to me, and I hope that you have noticed that."" Fellow tennis pros Djokovic and Serena Williams, as well as former soccer stars David Beckham and other athletes praised Nadal. ""Thank you for so many incredible moments and memories as a tennis fan and for everything that you have done to inspire young people around the world,” former England and Real Madrid player Beckham said. “My goodness, you will be missed,” Williams said. Carlos Alcaraz, regarded as Nadal's heir in Spanish tennis — he already has four Grand Slam titles at 21 — said it will be hard to avoid the inevitable pressure that will come along with following in the footsteps of his idol. “I don’t want to think that we have to continue his legacy. I don’t want it to be a frustration if we don’t reach the level that he reached,” Alcaraz said. “If I achieve half of what he achieved, I will be happy. His legacy is going to be eternal.” It wasn't quite clear what the future would hold for Nadal, who is an avid golfer and who has always been linked to Real Madrid. He has said in the past he would probably enjoy being the club's president one day. “My life will change radically,” Nadal said on Wednesday after arriving home in Mallorca, where he also has the Rafa Nadal Academy. “I have to accept this change as something normal, and accept that my life will be different now than it was for the last 30 years or so. I'm excited about it, there is no doubt.” One thing was certain: Nadal will never be too far away from tennis.  “I’ll retire from the sport but I will continue to be available for whatever is needed, and to being a good ambassador, which is what I have tried to do my entire life.” ___ AP Tennis Writer Howard Fendrich contributed. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
ABC News: Sports,Drama surrounds final 3 races of F1 season as drivers voice displeasure with recent FIA decisions,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/drama-surrounds-final-3-races-f1-season-drivers-116104131,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 14:02:29 -0500",There&rsquo;s three races remaining in the Formula 1 season and Max Verstappen is inching so close to a fourth consecutive world championship he could wrap it up Saturday night at the Las Vegas Grand Prix,"There’s three races remaining in the Formula 1 season and Max Verstappen is inching so close to a fourth consecutive world championship he could wrap it up Saturday night at the Las Vegas Grand Prix LAS VEGAS -- There are three races remaining in the Formula 1 season and Max Verstappen of Red Bull is close to a fourth consecutive world championship, which can wrap up Saturday night at the Las Vegas Grand Prix.  All is not smooth sailing headed into this final month of racing: — There's a new race director following the firing of Niels Wittich that blindsided the Grand Prix Drivers' Association so badly that it created an Instagram account to rebuke the lack of FIA transparency.  “It was a bit of a surprise, I think, for everybody,” said Mercedes driver George Russell, a GPDA director. “It’s a hell of a lot of pressure now onto the new race director (with) just three races left. Often, as drivers, we probably feel like we’re the last to find out this sort of information.” — Greg Maffei, the CEO of Liberty Media, the company that holds the commercial rights to F1, said last week he was stepping down from his position. This followed months of speculation that owner John Malone was displeased with Liberty landing in two different Justice Department investigations, one surrounding F1's refusal to allow Andretti Global into the series and the other over allegations of a Live Nation concert ticket monopoly. The Andretti team is expected to receive F1 approval to join the grid, albeit without Michael Andretti, who has scaled back his role dramatically since the IndyCar season ended in September.  — F1 denied over the weekend that Stefano Domenicali, CEO of Formula One Management, was also on the move amid rumors that the Italian would take over MotoGP if Liberty's purchase of the series is approved.  — Renee Wilm, a longtime Liberty Media employee, CEO of the Las Vegas Grand Prix and potentially Domenicali's successor, told The Associated Press she will fulfill any role Malone tasks her with but has little desire to move from Colorado to London to replace Domenicali. Maffei's newly opened job? Who knows.  Many drivers, particularly seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, have been at odds with FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem since his election following the 2021 season finale. In the GDPA statement, they reminded the sanctioning body “our members are adults” who don't need lectures and fines on foul language or jewelry bans, and simply want fair and consistent race control.  There's been no response from Ben Sulayem, and won't be this weekend since he does not attend the LVGP. He will be at Qatar and the finale in Abu Dhabi next month.  Hamilton doesn't think all the behind-the-scenes changes will be a fan topic as the season comes to a close. But he noted that consistency from race control is all the drivers have asked for, while throwing his support behind Domenicali and the job Maffei has done in growing F1 since Liberty took over.  “I really hope Stefano is not leaving because he's been so instrumental in changes and progress to this whole thing,” Hamilton said. “And he knows the sport as well as anyone. But all good things do come to an end, and whoever they put into place, I just hope they are like-minded. But sometimes you have to shake the trees.”  That's just what happened with the surprise departure of race director Wittich. Although drivers have been unhappy with race officiating this season and held a private GPDA meeting in Mexico City, Russell said they had no prior warning Wittich was out. The race director is the referee each weekend and Wittich has been in charge since 2022, when Michael Masi was fired following the controversial 2021 season-ending, championship-altering finale at Abu Dhabi. Now the man in charge for the final three races is Rui Marques, the Formula 2 and Formula 3 race director.  Las Vegas, which overcame multiple stumbling blocks in last year's debut before putting on one of the best races of the season, is a difficult place to start. Verstappen can win his fourth title by simply scoring three points more than Lando Norris of McLaren.  “It’s a bit weird with three races to go to do that,” Verstappen said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re positive or negative about certain things. I thought in Brazil there was definitely room for improvement, for example. It’s still a bit weird having to now then deal with a different race director.” Charles Leclerc of Ferrari wondered why the move was made with only three races to go.  “To do it so late in the season, at such a crucial moment of the season, it could have probably been managed in a better way,” he said. The drivers have consistently asked for clearer guidelines in the officiating of races, specifically regarding track limits and racing rules. The drivers have no idea how Marques will officiate, highlighting a disconnect between the competitors and Ben Sulaymen's FIA.   “We just want to be transparent with the FIA and have this dialogue that is happening,” Russell said. “And I think the departure of Niels is also a prime example of not being a part of these conversations.” The GDPA statement made clear the drivers do not think their voice is being heard.  “If we feel we’re being listened to, and some of the changes that we are requesting are implemented, because ultimately we’re only doing it for the benefit of the sport, then maybe our confidence will increase,” Russell said. “But I think there’s a number of drivers who feel a bit fed up with the whole situation. It only seems to be going in the wrong direction.” He also said the relationship between the drivers and the FIA seems fractured.  “Sometimes just hiring and firing is not the solution,” he said. “You need to work together to improve the problem.” Norris, who has battled Verstappen this year with mixed officiating rulings, said “obviously things are not running as smoothly as what we would want.”  Marques has his first driver meeting ahead of Thursday night's two practice sessions and then three weeks to prove to the competitors he is up for the job.  Carlos Sainz Jr., who will leave Ferrari for Williams at the end of the season, hopes the drama doesn't distract from the momentum F1 has built over the last five years.  “I think Formula 1 is in a great moment right now and all these rumors, I think in every team, every job, there's job changes,” he said. “It's not big drama. I'm a big fan of the people you mentioned, they've done an incredible job in Formula 1 and Formula 1 is what it is thanks to these people. But it's just so emotional, especially the Stefano one. The only one that has a real effect is the race director. But I think if he does a good job, it should be transparent and nothing big.” ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Items belonging to former Red Sox President and CEO Larry Lucchino, who died in April at the age of 78, will be auctioned starting Saturday with proceeds going to The Lucchino Family Foundation, which funds charities throughout New England. “My brother, Larry, embodied the spirit of generosity,” said Frank Lucchino, a retired judge from Pennsylvania. Items include Lucchino’s Commissioner’s Trophy and ring from the curse-ending 2004 World Series in which the Red Sox had to first beat the New York Yankees for the opportunity to face the St. Louis Cardinals in the series. Two other championship trophies from Lucchino’s tenure, 2007 and 2013, are being auctioned along with another one from 2018. Other items include 2004 and 2007 championship banners that flew at Fenway Park, a couple of stadium seats and a turnstile, and an electric guitar signed by Boston rockers Aerosmith when they played at Fenway in 2010. Lucchino served as Baltimore Orioles president, leading the effort to build Camden Yards, before doing the same thing for the San Diego Padres — building another new ballpark. In Boston, he helped to assemble the new ownership group led by John Henry and Tom Werner that bought the franchise in 2002. The group opted to renovate rather than replace Fenway Park, which opened in 1912, preserving the oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball for future generations. The online auction is being handled by Bonhams Skinner. Included in the auction are non-Red Sox items owned by Lucchino, such as a World Series ring won with the Orioles and a Super Bowl ring from Washington.

ABC News: Sports,It's getting harder to stay on the PGA Tour. Here's why,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/harder-stay-pga-tour-116115451,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:50:28 -0500",The PGA Tour is making sweeping changes to its eligibility and it's only going to get more difficult to keep a tour card,"The PGA Tour is making sweeping changes to its eligibility and it's only going to get more difficult to keep a tour card The PGA Tour is making the most sweeping changes to its eligibility in more than 40 years by eliminating 25 tour cards, along with shrinking the size of its fields. The all-exempt tour had been in place since 1983, meaning the top 125 players from the official money list — now the FedEx Cup standings — kept a full PGA Tour card the following season. That changes in 2026 after the PGA Tour policy board approved a new priority list on Monday. Only the top 100 players will earn full tour cards for the following year. The top 30 from the developmental Korn Ferry Tour used to advance to the PGA Tour. That number now goes to 20. Five players from qualifying school will get cards — it previously was the top five and ties. The tour also is doing away with 156-man fields except for two tournaments held on multiple courses. Most tournaments will have 120 players before Daylight Saving Time, then 132 players in spring and a maximum of 144 players in the summer months. Here's a look at what's behind the changes and what it means: The all-exempt tour led to a bloated membership in which nearly 200 players were on the membership rolls through one exemption or another, and those toward the bottom of the priority list could not get into all the tournaments they wanted to play. Those who graduated from the Korn Ferry Tour, for example, could only get in three or four tournaments over the first few months of the season, giving them a disadvantage. The PGA Tour believes that limited full status to the top 100 instead of the top 125 will give everyone who earns a card a fair chance at getting into regular tournaments. Priority to get into tournaments starts with winners of the majors and The Players Championship over the last five years; winners of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Memorial and Genesis Invitational the last three years; tournament winners the last two years and career money leaders. Next are the top 125; players who have been given a medical extension; and then the 45 players who earned cards from the Korn Ferry Tour, European tour and Q-school. After that are those who finished from No. 126 to No. 150 in the FedEx Cup. All of them have PGA Tour cards. But there's not room for them in every tournament. The most common refrain in golf is to play better to get better status. Those who perennially finish in the top 100 should have no trouble keeping their cards, and they will have fewer players to beat because the fields will be smaller. It also helps newcomers from the Korn Ferry Tour, European tour and Q-school. They can expect to get into every regular tournament, increasing their odds of getting into some of the $20 million signature events. The PGA Tour, already the strongest circuit in golf, is likely to be even more competitive with a greater chance of the top names in contention. The tour also hopes — this is still to be determined — it will improve the pace of play and keep rounds from spilling over into the next day. Players like Peter Malnati and Taylor Pendrith come to mind. Under the new system, neither would have had a full PGA Tour card this year and likely would not have been in the fields for the tournaments they won — Malnati at the Valspar Championship and Pendrith at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. Those wins make them exempt through 2026. Players who have not performed consistently well, who seem to struggle each year just to finish in the top 125, will have to be at their best to stay on tour. The PGA Tour also is reducing the four spots from Monday qualifiers at open tournaments. Now there will only two spots for the 132-man fields and none for fields of 120 players. One of golf's charms is how one week can change a career. Then again, there has been only one Monday qualifier to win in the last five years — Corey Conners in the 2019 Texas Open. The new eligibility starts in 2026, so that puts a huge emphasis on playing well this year knowing that only the top 100 will keep full status. The four majors are not run by the PGA Tour. The Masters has the smallest field, typically fewer than 100 players. The U.S. Open, British Open and PGA Championship have 156-man fields. The Players Championship, the premier event run by the PGA Tour, is reducing its field from 144 players to 120. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

ABC News: Sports,New Hampshire courts hear 2 cases on transgender girls playing girls sports,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/new-hampshire-court-hears-cases-transgender-girls-playing-116102227,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 08:02:23 -0500",Two New Hampshire fathers who were punished for wearing pink wristbands marked &ldquo;XX&rdquo; to represent female chromosomes at a high school soccer game say they didn't set out to harass or otherwise target a transgender athlete,"Two New Hampshire fathers who were punished for wearing pink wristbands marked “XX” to represent female chromosomes at a high school soccer game say they didn't set out to harass or otherwise target a transgender athlete CONCORD, N.H. -- Two New Hampshire fathers who were barred from school district events for wearing pink wristbands marked “XX” to represent female chromosomes insisted at a federal court hearing Thursday that they didn't set out to harass or otherwise target a transgender soccer player at the game they attended. But a judge hearing the case suggested the message the parents sent may matter more than their intentions. Kyle Fellers and Anthony Foote sued the Bow school district after being banned from school grounds for wearing the wristbands at their daughters' soccer game in September. The no-trespass orders have since expired, but a judge is deciding whether the plaintiffs should be allowed to wear the wristbands and carry signs at upcoming school events, including basketball games, swim meets and a music concert, while the case proceeds. Testifying at Thursday's hearing, both men said that they did not view the wristbands as a protest against Parker Tirrell, a transgender girl on the opposing team, but rather as a show of support for their daughters and their teammates. U.S. District Court Judge Steven McAuliffe questioned whether there is a meaningful distinction and whether their intentions matter.  “Sometimes the message you think you’re sending might not be the message that is being sent,” he said.  McAuliffe asked Foote whether it occurred to him that a transgender person might interpret the pink XX wristbands as an attempt to invalidate their existence. “If he’s a trans female, pink might be a color he likes,” Foote said. McAuliffe also noted that while both plaintiffs said they had no problem with transgender people outside the issue of sports, they repeatedly referred to the athlete in question as a boy. “You seem to go out of your way to suggest there’s no such thing as a trans girl,” McAuliffe said. Foote disagreed, saying it was “like learning a new language” to refer to transgender people. In a separate courtroom earlier Thursday, another judge held a hearing on a lawsuit brought by Parker Tirrell and another student challenging the state law that bans transgender athletes in grades 5 to 12 from teams that align with their gender identity. It requires schools to designate all teams as either girls, boys or coed, with eligibility determined based on students’ birth certificates “or other evidence.” U.S. District Court Chief Judge Landya McCafferty ruled earlier this year that the teens can try out for and play on girls school sports teams. The order only applies to those two individuals for now as they seek to overturn the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act on behalf of all transgender girl students in New Hampshire.  Lawyers for the teens said in court Thursday they hoped the matter could go to trial and be resolved before the start of the next school year in September. They said the teens’ school districts and others in the state have asked for guidance regarding the statute. Lawyers for the state said they needed more time to prepare.  Judge Talesha Saint-Marc suggested the timing of the trial was ambitious and asked that both sides talk further about scheduling.  Gov. Chris Sununu, who signed the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act into law in July, has said it “ensures fairness and safety in women’s sports by maintaining integrity and competitive balance in athletic competitions.” About half of states have adopted similar measures. In the Bow case, school district officials have said they acted appropriately in sanctioning the parents for conduct they knew violated school policy at athletic events. They'll explain their evidence on Friday. On Thursday, the plaintiff's lawyer, Endel Kolde, accused the district of “breathtaking” overreach by asserting that the wristbands target transgender students in general, regardless of whether such students were present at the events. “This is viewpoint discrimination, and it’s very clear they’re proud of it,” Kolde said. Kolde initially conceded that a school district can limit speech “to some degree” to protect children from harassment, but he stopped short of agreeing with the judge’s claim that yelling “transgender students out” at a particular player would be subject to such regulation. “It might be,” he said. “I’m trying to get you to concede the obvious,” McAuliffe said. “It’s less than obvious to me,” Kolde said. Feller, the first witness in the case involving the wristbands, said he purchased them thinking his daughter and her teammates would wear them, but ended up wearing one himself after they declined. After being told to leave the game, he stood in the parking lot with a sign that said “Protect women’s sports for female athletes.” “I wanted to support women’s sports and I believed what was going on was a travesty,” he said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
ABC News: Sports,"If the Jets don't want Aaron Rodgers back, the 4-time MVP will find another home: Analysis",https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/jets-aaron-rodgers-back-4-time-mvp-find-116126622,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 08:02:21 -0500",Joe Douglas is gone,"Joe Douglas is gone On Football analyzes the biggest topics in the NFL from week to week. For more On Football analysis, head here. ___ Joe Douglas is gone. Robert Saleh already was fired. Aaron Rodgers could be next to leave the New York Jets. Douglas lost his job as the general manager on Tuesday, six weeks after the head coach was replaced following a 2-3 start. The Jets have gone 1-5 under interim coach Jeff Ulbrich so owner Woody Johnson sent Douglas packing. Rodgers has played more like a 40-year-old quarterback coming off an Achilles tendon injury than a four-time NFL MVP. He’s expressed a desire to play another season. The big question is whether the Jets will want him back. Maybe they’ll decide to take one more shot at a playoff run with Rodgers while having him mentor a rookie quarterback. Or, they could start fresh. There are significant contract ramifications either way. Rodgers is slated to make a non-guaranteed $37.5 million in 2025 with a dead cap hit of $49 million as his salary cap total goes from $17.1 million to $23.5 million. The Jets could spread the dead money over two years by releasing Rodgers with the use of post-June 1 designation. He has a no-trade clause in his contract so they would need his permission to make a deal. If Rodgers doesn’t retire and New York’s new regime wants a clean slate, here are potential destinations for the future first-ballot Hall of Famer: SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS: This could only happen if Brock Purdy’s shoulder injury is more significant than is known. Rodgers is a native of northern California and grew up a Niners fan. Returning home to help San Francisco win its sixth Super Bowl has to be attractive. Playing for coach Kyle Shanahan surrounded by playmakers Christian McCaffrey, Deebo Samuel and George Kittle would be a quarterback’s dream. Again, Purdy is the team’s present and future. And, he’s resilient. Purdy rebounded from elbow surgery following his rookie season to start Week 1 last year and ended up finishing fourth in MVP voting, leading the 49ers to the Super Bowl. Purdy also is due for a contract extension and a major raise so the salary cap makes this even more of a longshot. But never say never in the NFL. MINNESOTA VIKINGS: Sam Darnold has been more than a stopgap, helping the Vikings (8-2) to an impressive start. J.J. McCarthy is the future, however, and Darnold will be a free agent after the season. If the Vikings fall short of a Super Bowl and Rodgers shows over the final six weeks that he can play championship football, this could be a fit. The Vikings could let McCarthy sit and learn for another year, especially coming off a knee injury that required a second surgery earlier this month. NEW YORK GIANTS: Rodgers wouldn’t have to move. The Giants will need a quarterback after benching Daniel Jones this week with the intent to move on from him. They could draft a quarterback in the first round and have him learn behind Rodgers for a season. That’ll depend on which pick New York ends up with because it’s a thin draft class. Unlike the Jets, the Giants (2-8) haven’t made any coaching or GM changes yet. If it’s status quo with GM Joe Schoen and coach Brian Daboll, one year with Rodgers isn’t unrealistic. LAS VEGAS RAIDERS: They also need a quarterback. Brock Bowers could set an NFL record for most catches by a tight end if he had Rodgers next season. The Raiders (2-8) are aiming for a high pick to get a shot at a quarterback of their choice. New minority owner Tom Brady believes rookie quarterbacks need time to develop and learn. The seven-time Super Bowl champion would have to be in favor of having Rodgers start and tutor a youngster. TENNESSEE TITANS: If Will Levis doesn’t prove over the final seven games that he can be a No. 1 quarterback, the Titans (2-8) will be in the QB market and likely have a high draft pick. It’s another scenario where Rodgers would fit as a one-year bridge. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
ABC News: Sports,F1 closer to approving expanded grid for General Motors entry initially started by Michael Andretti,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/f1-closer-approving-andretti-bid-expanded-grid-michael-116122396,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 09:46:34 -0500","With a restructuring at Andretti Global that pushed Michael Andretti into a smaller role, the chances of his organization landing a Formula 1 team have substantially increased","With a restructuring at Andretti Global that pushed Michael Andretti into a smaller role, the chances of his organization landing a Formula 1 team have substantially increased LAS VEGAS -- With a restructuring at Andretti Global that pushed Michael Andretti into a smaller role, the chances of his organization landing a Formula 1 team have substantially increased.  So much so that F1 and Formula One Management could have a decision to grant the General Motors-backed entry a spot as the 11th team on the grid in the coming weeks. Dan Towriss, now the majority owner of the Andretti organization, was at the Las Vegas Grand Prix on Thursday scoping his chances of entering the top motorsports series in the world.  So was the FBI, allegedly, as part of a Department of Justice investigation into why F1 denied the Andretti organization expansion into the series. F1 currently has 10 teams that field 20 cars and only one — the organization owned by California businessman Gene Haas — is an American team.  Las Vegas marks the third race this season in the United States, more than any other country, as F1 has exploded in American popularity over the last five years.  Even so, Andretti could not get approval from F1 to enter the series. But, the situation changed in September when Andretti scaled back his role with his namesake organization. Now with Towriss in charge, talks have amplified, even though it is not clear what the name of an Andretti-less F1 team would even be. Cadillac would do the engines — but says it won't be ready until 2028 — which means a 2026 Towriss-led F1 team would be GM branded but with a partner engine supplier.  Most of the existing teams have been largely opposed to an 11th team entering F1, citing a dilution in prize money and the massive expenses they've already committed to the series. But, Andretti among others believed the teams' position was personal in that they simply didn't like Andretti, who ran 13 races in the 1993 season. His father, Mario, is the 1978 F1 world champion.  The Andretti application had already been approved by the FIA, which is F1's ruling body, but later denied by F1 itself. F1 promised to revisit the issue once General Motors had an engine ready to compete.  The existing 10 F1 teams have no actual vote or say in if the grid is expanded, which Mercedes boss Toto Wolff reiterated Thursday when The Associated Press asked why the sudden chance of acceptance in a potential 11th team.  “We have an obligation, a statutory obligation as directors, to present the standpoint that is the best for our company and for our employees, and we’ve done that,” Wolff said. ""I think if a team can add to the championship, particularly if GM decides to come in as a team owner, that is a different story.  “And as long as it is creative, that means we’re growing the popularity of the sport, we’re growing the revenue of the sport, then no team will be ever against it. So I’m putting my hope in there.” Wolff has been eager to hear from Towriss directly on what the plans for the organization are now that Andretti has a smaller role.  “No one from Andretti or Andretti Global or whatever the name will be has ever spoken to me a single sentence in presentation of what the creative part is,” he said. ""But they don’t need to because the teams don’t decide. It is the commercial rights holder, with the FIA, we have no say. If I want to be invited to a party and go to the party, I’m sitting down at the table and telling who I am and why I’m really good fun and sitting here and everybody will enjoy my presence.  “That hasn’t happened, but you know, that’s now my personal point of view, not a professional, because there’s nothing we can do, nothing we can say,” Wolff continued. “And I don’t know the people. I’ve obviously spoken to Mario. I didn’t speak to his son. I didn’t speak to any other people that are behind that. I don’t know who they are. So I know GM, GM is great.” Fred Vasseur, team principal at Ferrari, said he's not opposed to another team if it adds value to F1.  “The discussion is between FIA, the team, and FOM. It’s not our choice,” he said. “For sure, as Toto said, that if it’s good for the sport, good for the show, good for the business, and adds value on the sporting side, that we are all OK.” ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
ABC News: Sports,Giants release quarterback Daniel Jones just days after benching him,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/giants-release-quarterback-daniel-jones-days-after-benching-116138874,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 13:30:16 -0500",The Daniel Jones era in New York is over,"The Daniel Jones era in New York is over EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- The Daniel Jones era in New York is over. The Giants quarterback was granted his release on Friday by the team just days after the franchise said it was benching him in favor of third-stringer Tommy DeVito. “Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him,"" Giants president John Mara said in a statement. “We mutually agreed that would be best for him and for the team. Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way.” Mara added he was “disappointed” at the quick dissolution of the team’s relationship with Jones, who signed a four-year $160 million contract in March 2023 after leading the Giants to a playoff berth. “We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him,” Mara continued. “We wish him nothing but the best in the future.” The 27-year-old Jones told reporters Thursday that he gave the team everything he had after being taken sixth overall in the 2019 draft and he believes he still has a future in the NFL. He held himself accountable for the Giants (2-8) making the postseason once in his tenure as the starter. The Duke product took over early in his rookie season when then-coach Pat Shurmur benched two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning, who was near the end of his career. Coach Brian Daboll benched Jones on Monday after the Giants returned to practice following a bye week and a 20-17 overtime loss to Carolina in Germany. Tommy DeVito will start Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with Daboll hoping he can spark the team. “Definitely not happy about it,” said Jones, who read a 90-second statement before taking questions from reporters. “Yeah, not what you want to hear. So, yeah, all those emotions you have. But at the end of the day, this is football. We’re in a business where you're expected to get results and we weren’t doing it.” Jones, who is now free to sign with any team, went 24-44-1 as a starter in New York after being the sixth overall pick in the 2019 draft. A significant portion of those victories came in 2022, when the Giants went 9-7-1 and beat Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs. Yet whatever forward momentum the club generated in 2022 quickly evaporated in 2023. New York was 1-5 in Jones' six starts during an injury-marred season and he further regressed this fall. Jones completed just 63% of his passes with eight touchdowns and seven interceptions even with dynamic rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers at his disposal. The Giants are last in the NFL in scoring and with public sentiment all but gone for the player once known as “Danny Dimes,” Daboll opted to go in another direction while Jones can get a head start on trying to reboot his career elsewhere. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Multiple reports out of Argentina said Mascherano has already agreed to take over as coach at Inter Miami as the replacement for Gerardo “Tata” Martino — who stepped down citing personal reasons. Mascherano emerged as Inter Miami's frontrunner earlier this week, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because no decision has been revealed by the team. Inter Miami co-owner Jorge Mas said the team had three finalists in mind for the job, then made a pick on the replacement Wednesday — but would not confirm that the deal with Mascherano is done, or that he even was the final selection. “We are very near the end of the process,” Mas said. “We will be announcing a new coach for Inter Miami in the upcoming days."" Messi and Mascherano were teammates both for Argentina and with Barcelona; for the Spanish club, Mascherano also played alongside current Inter Miami standouts Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets and Luis Suarez. Mascherano, at one time, was the all-time leader for Argentina’s national team in international appearances; Messi has since broken that record. Mas said he spoke with Messi last week about the coaching search. It’s not known if Messi played an active role in recruiting Mascherano, who currently is Argentina’s U-20 national coach. “I asked him, 'What is important to you? And what do you think is important to get the best out of our roster and out of our 11 and how do we improve?” Mas said. “And Leo shared with me his thoughts. ... Without a doubt, a familiarity with Leo and the other stars is an advantage in every aspect. Obviously, I want Leo to feel comfortable with the new trainer, with the new coach coming in."" Martino guided Inter Miami to the best regular season record in Major League Soccer history this season. He was hired in July 2023, right around the time that Messi debuted for the club and insisted Friday that he needs to leave for personal reasons. Inter Miami — which won the 2023 Leagues Cup and MLS Supporters Shield this season under Martino — was eliminated in the first round of this year’s MLS Cup playoffs. The team's 2025 season starts with training camp in January. Martino also had deep ties to Messi before coming to Inter Miami; he coached the world's most decorated men's player and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner with Barcelona and Argentina’s national team before reuniting with him in South Florida. Martino said Friday he decided just before the start of the playoffs that he would not be back with Inter Miami next season. “Needless to say, we’ve enjoyed it a lot and I’m grateful for the opportunity, on behalf of my entire coaching staff, to have been able to work at this club,” Martino said Friday in his farewell news conference. “The truth is that it’s been very captivating being part of the change during this year and a half.” Inter Miami was 26-9-12 in MLS regular season matches in the Martino era. The 40-year-old Mascherano also played for five seasons in the Premier League, most of that with Liverpool. He played in the World Cup four times for Argentina — 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018. The new coach — Mascherano or anyone else — will have a very busy first year. Inter Miami has a preseason tour planned in 2025, plus a 34-match MLS regular season and will play in Leagues Cup, the CONCACAF Champions Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. “This is an extremely attractive position for a coach,” Mas said. Messi — MLS' highest-paid player, someone who had a 2 1/2-year deal worth an estimated $150 million in total when he joined Inter Miami — is going into his final guaranteed season with the club. He has an option for 2026, the year that Inter Miami plans to finally move into its Freedom Park complex currently being built near Miami International Airport. “Leo and I will sit and we'll discuss the future,” Mas said. “As I've said before, and I will repeat it now, I fully expect that the opening of our new stadium in 2026 in Miami — and the opening of our '26 season, hopefully after a trophy-laden 2025 season — that Lionel Messi will be our No. 10.” ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
ABC News: Sports,Aaron Judge won't be bothered if Juan Soto gets bigger contract from Yankees than his $360M deal,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/aaron-judge-bothered-juan-soto-gets-bigger-contract-116147501,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 16:34:29 -0500","Aaron Judge won&rsquo;t be bothered if Juan Soto gets a bigger deal from the New York Yankees than the captain&rsquo;s $360 million, nine-year contract","Aaron Judge won’t be bothered if Juan Soto gets a bigger deal from the New York Yankees than the captain’s $360 million, nine-year contract NEW YORK -- Aaron Judge won't be bothered if free agent Juan Soto gets a bigger deal from the New York Yankees than the captain's $360 million, nine-year contract.  “It ain’t my money. I really don’t care as long as we get the best players, we get the most that we can, I’m happy with whatever,” Judge said Friday, a day after he was a unanimous winner of his second AL MVP award. “That's never been something on my mind about who gets paid the most.” Judge led the major leagues with 58 homers, 144 RBIs and 133 walks while hitting .322 as New York reached the World Series for the first time since 2009, only to lose to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Soto batted .288 with 41 homers, 109 RBIs and 129 walks in his first season with the Yankees and finished third in MVP voting, also trailing Kansas City shortstop Bobby Witt. Jr. A free agent at 26, Soto has met with the Yankees, Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers and Boston Red Sox, and he plans to meet with the Philadelphia Phillies, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the meetings have not been publicly announced. Negotiations are not likely to intensify until after Thanksgiving. Judge hasn’t spoken with Soto since the World Series. Judge went through the free-agent experience after hitting an AL record 62 homers in 2022. “The best thing is to really give those guys space,"" Judge said. ""I talked to him all season and he knows how we feel about him and I think the most important thing is now let him do his thing with his family, pray about it, talk with people and come to the right decision for him and his family.” Soto met with Yankees officials on Monday at a hotel in southern California, a group that included owner Hal Steinbrenner, team president Randy Levine, general manager Brian Cashman, manager Aaron Boone and senior adviser for baseball operations Omar Minaya. “We had a good meeting. It was a very honest back-and-forth dialogue, a couple hours long,” Steinbrenner said Wednesday. Asked how confident he was about keeping Soto, Steinbrenner said: “No idea. We’ll be in the mix. I’ll leave it at that.” Soto and Judge filled the Nos. 2 and 3 slots in the Yankees batting order in a franchise-record 153 games, topping the 145 of Joe Dugan and Babe Ruth in 1923, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. “I get to see a lot of pitches,"" Judge said. ""He's going to be a tough at-bat in front of me. He’s going to wear down the pitcher right there in the first inning, within the first 15 pitches or so. Yeah, I think that was a big impact just having having a guy like that in front of you.  ""If I could have eight Juan Sotos in the lineup with me, I would love that.” After the World Series, Judge spent about a week in Tampa, Florida, where the Yankees hold spring training, and met with Steinbrenner. “We kind of just discussed a lot of things from Juan to other guys that are kind of out there that I think could definitely help this team,:"" Judge said. ""So I kind of just gave my input on a couple things.” Judge said when he agreed to his big deal in late 2022, Steinbrenner wanted to have a deeper relationship. They've been meeting every week or two, and pitcher Gerrit Cole has developed a similar exchange with the owner. “I think just having that relationship to where I can kind of communicate with him about what I’m seeing, what I’m feeling, what I see with the guys, what I see against other guys that we play against,” Judge said. “I think it’s a cool part to where I think just the more communication you have from top to bottom, it just — it makes everybody better.” Judge's contract is baseball's fourth largest behind the deals of the Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani ($700 million), the Los Angeles Angels' Mike Trout ($426.5 million) and the Dodgers' Mookie Betts ($365 million). Judge cited the example of teammate Giancarlo Stanton, whose $325 million deal was the highest when he joined the Yankees ahead of the 2018 season but now ranks tied for ninth. “Even though he signed one of those — the first big mega-contracts back in Miami, once he came here he didn’t care about the highest-paid guy. He just wanted good players around him,” Judge said. In joining Mickey Mantle in 1956 as the Yankees' only unanimous MVPs, Judge credited his teammates. “You look at every single one of my teammates in that room and know that each and every single one of them impacted me in a way that put me in that position,” Judge said. “So it’s always going to be a team award in my book.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

ABC News: Sports,Brock Purdy will miss Sunday's game for the 49ers with a shoulder injury,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/brock-purdy-miss-sundays-game-49ers-shoulder-injury-116149657,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:42:19 -0500",San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy will miss Sunday&rsquo;s game against the Green Bay Packers with a sore throwing shoulder,"San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy will miss Sunday’s game against the Green Bay Packers with a sore throwing shoulder SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- San Francisco quarterback Brock Purdy will miss Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers with a sore throwing shoulder, dealing another blow to the 49ers' playoff hopes.  Purdy injured his right shoulder in last Sunday's loss to the Seattle Seahawks. He underwent an MRI on Monday that showed no structural damage and the team initially thought he could play this week.  But when Purdy's shoulder didn't feel right when he made a few warmup throws at practice Thursday, those plans changed. “We thought he just needed some rest and we really weren’t concerned about him not being good this week,” coach Kyle Shanahan said Friday. “But when he started up Thursday, it just surprised him, surprised us how it felt. So we had to shut him down.” Shanahan said the team doesn't believe the injury is a long-term concern but he is uncertain whether Purdy will need to miss any additional time. “The MRI doesn’t look like that, so it should be all right,” Shanahan said. “But the way it responded this week, it’s really up in the air for next week. We’ll have to see on Monday.”  The 49ers also will be missing star defensive end Nick Bosa, who is out after leaving last week's game in the second half with injuries to his left hip and oblique. Left tackle Trent Williams is questionable with an ankle injury and will be a game-time decision.  San Francisco struggled on defense without Bosa last week and now will go the entire game this week without two of the team's most important players.  The Niners (5-5) are currently in a three-way tie for second in the NFC West, a game behind first-place Arizona, and have little margin for error if they want to get back to the playoffs after making it to the Super Bowl last season. “I know it’s disappointing,” Shanahan said. “We knew there was a chance for Nick. I think the guys were a little surprised with Brock yesterday, but we addressed all that today. We’re going to have 48 guys in uniform. I know our guys believe in themselves. I believe in them. We’re missing two good players, definitely. But we got a lot of good players out there. So by no means do we not have a chance to win.” This will be the first time Purdy has missed a start because of an injury since taking over as the 49ers’ quarterback in December 2022. Brandon Allen will start in his place. Purdy has completed 66% of his passes this season for 2,613 yards, 13 TDs, eight interceptions and a 95.9 passer rating that is down significantly from his league-leading mark of 113 in 2023. Allen has been mostly a backup since being drafted by Jacksonville in 2016. Allen last started a game in Week 18 of the 2021 season for Cincinnati and has thrown just three passes the last three seasons — including none since joining San Francisco in 2023. Allen said he preparation hasn't changed this week with the exception of getting to work with the first-team receivers instead of running the scout team.  “It’s an opportunity.” he said. “The circumstances are what they are. But I think our team all year long we’ve been kind of dealing with injuries here and there. It’s been a big next-man-up mentality. It’s definitely an opportunity for me to go out and play well and put our guys in a good position to win the game. Obviously, we want Brock back and healthy and all that. But for the time being, it is an opportunity for me.” Joshua Dobbs will be the backup Sunday. San Francisco also will be without starting cornerback Charvarius Ward, who returned to the team this week following the death of his 1-year-old daughter on Oct. 28 but needs more time to get back up to speed. Punt returner Jacob Cowing (concussion), linebacker Tatum Bethune (knee) and defensive lineman Kevin Givens (groin) are also out. The Packers will also be without two key defensive players with cornerback Jaire Alexander ruled out after leaving last week's game with a knee injury and linebacker Edgerrin Cooper out with an injured hamstring. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
ABC News: Sports,Marta's magic helped get the Pride to Saturday's NWSL title game against the Washington Spirit,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/martas-magic-helped-pride-saturdays-nwsl-title-game-116150088,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 17:54:27 -0500",A goal by Marta helped propel the Orlando Pride into Saturday&rsquo;s National Women&rsquo;s Soccer League championship game against the Washington Spirit,"A goal by Marta helped propel the Orlando Pride into Saturday’s National Women’s Soccer League championship game against the Washington Spirit With technical prowess and considerable style, Marta danced around two sliding defenders, outwitted a goalkeeper and calmly scored as another player rushed forward in desperation to stop her.  It was more Marta Magic. That goal last weekend helped propel the Orlando Pride into Saturday's National Women's Soccer League championship game against the Washington Spirit.  Barbra Banda also scored in the Pride's 3-2 semifinal victory over the Kansas City Current. While Banda has had an incredible first season with the Pride, captain Marta has been the talisman that has helped lead the team in its remarkable turnaround this year.  The last time the Pride were in the NWSL playoffs was in 2017 — Marta's first year with the club. But this season they nearly went undefeated, going 23 games without a loss to start the season before losing 2-0 to the Portland Thorns with just two regular-season games left. “I think because of the way that we did it, during this season, from beginning to now, it’s something very special that I’ve never had before with any other club that I’ve played for,"" Marta said. ""Plus year by year, we see in America, strong competition. This is the best league in the world. And you never know what’s going to happen, and it’s hard to keep winning the games, being in the first place almost like the whole season. That’s why it’s really different and so special.” Marta’s goal was the latest gasp-inducing moment in a stellar career filled with them. Known by just her first name, the 38-year-old is a six-time FIFA world player of the year.  ""Let's see if tomorrow I can do something similar — or even better,"" Marta said on Friday. Her teammate Kylie Strom chimed in: “That was the greatest goal I've ever witnessed, hands down."" Appropriate. Earlier this year, FIFA announced that the best goal in women's soccer each year would earn the Marta Award. In a lighthearted moment the day before the title match, Marta was asked if she thought it was possible she might give the award to herself.  “You guys need to decide, because who votes for the best goal in the year? It’s you. It’s the people in the public. So it should be really interesting, like Marta’s Award goes to Marta!” she said with a laugh.  Marta has played in six World Cups for Brazil and played this summer in her sixth Olympics, winning a silver medal after falling in the final to the United States. She previously said this would be her final year with the national team.  But since then Brazil was named the host of the 2027 Women's World Cup.  ""I had a conversation with my coach, the national team coach, and I was really clear about playing in 2027. I told him it’s not my goal anymore,” she said. “But I’m always available to help the national team. And if they think I still can do something during this preparation for the World Cup, yeah, I would be happy to help them."" Marta's club career started in Brazil when she was just 16. She has also played in Sweden and in the U.S. professional women's leagues that came before the NWSL.  With nine regular-season goals, Marta has had one of her best seasons since she joined the Pride.  “I can never pick a side, I never pick favorites — but I love to see this for Marta,"" U.S. coach Emma Hayes said. “Marta is someone we all like, admire and are grateful for. And that goal was just like prime Marta at her best. And so grateful for and thankful for her that she got the opportunity with another game with her team.” The Pride went 18-2-6 this season, clinching the NWSL Shield for the first trophy in club history. Orlando also set a record with 60 regular-season points to finish atop the standings.  “We are sitting top of the table, but I think there still are a lot of doubters. I think there’s people out there who say, maybe this was a one-off season,” Strom said. “But we’re here to prove them all wrong. So I think we do carry a bit of that underdog mentality still with us.” The second-seeded Spirit advanced to the title match at Kansas City's CPKC Stadium last weekend on a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw against defending champions Gotham FC.  The Spirit's roster includes Trinity Rodman, a standout forward who formed the so-called “Triple Espresso” trio with Mallory Swanson and Sophia Smith for the United States at the Olympics.  ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
NYT > Sports,New York Giants Release Quarterback Daniel Jones,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940785/2024/11/22/ny-giants-daniel-jones-release-qb/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:01:59 +0000","Jones, in his sixth season with New York after the team drafted him No. 6 overall in 2019, had a 25-45-1 overall record as a starter.","NFL By Charlotte Carroll, Dan Duggan and Lauren Smith The New York Giants have released quarterback Daniel Jones, the team announced Friday. “Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him,” Giants president John Mara said in a statement. “We mutually agreed that would be best for him and for the team. Advertisement “Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way. His handling of this situation yesterday exemplifies just that. We are all disappointed in how things have worked out. We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him. We wish him nothing but the best in the future.” Brian Daboll met with #giants team and informed them of Daniel Jones release before it went public and before today’s practice “This is not an easy thing” pic.twitter.com/fmM3wcrWo7 — Charlotte Carroll (@charlottecrrll) November 22, 2024  Jones, in his sixth season with the Giants after the team drafted him No. 6 overall in 2019, was benched Monday following the Giants’ 2-8 start to the season, during which he completed 63.3 percent of his passes for 2,070 yards, eight touchdowns and seven interceptions through 10 games. GO DEEPER Giants benching QB Daniel Jones, Tommy DeVito taking over as starter The 27-year-old quarterback has played in 70 games for New York the past six seasons, throwing for 14,582 yards with 70 touchdowns and 47 interceptions and tallying a 64.1 completion percentage. Jones seemed to foreshadow his release when he spoke with reporters following Thursday’s practice. “The opportunity to play for the New York Giants was truly a dream come true. I’m extremely grateful to the Mara and Tisch families for the chance to play here,” he said. “No one wanted to win more games worse than me. I gave everything I had on the field and in preparation. Of course, this season has been disappointing for all and, of course, I wish I could have done more. I’m 100% accountable for my part. I did not play well enough, consistently enough to help the team get (good) results.” GO DEEPER Giants QB Daniel Jones addresses benching, bids farewell to fans Jones will go on waivers following his release and is unlikely to be claimed by another team with $13.8 million of guaranteed money remaining on his contract. Jones signed a four-year, $160 million extension with the Giants ahead of the 2023 season. To answer the most common questions I’m seeing:  • No impact on the Giants’ cap whether they released him now or after the season.  • Jones can sign with another team immediately after he clears waivers (he’ll clear waivers). — Dan Duggan (@DDuggan21) November 22, 2024  Players who clear waivers become free agents, and Jones could have some intriguing options once he hits the open market. He could try to sign on with a playoff-caliber team in need of a quality backup. He also could try to go to a place where he might have a chance to start again this year (Jacksonville?). Or perhaps he’ll seek out a team where he could “audition” to be the team’s quarterback in 2025 (Las Vegas?). Of course, Jones could also choose to take some time away from football before picking his next destination this offseason. Cowboys EVP Stephen Jones said on @SASportsStar that they have no interest in adding former Giants QB Daniel Jones. “No, I think we’re in good shape at our quarterback spot. We think Cooper (Rush) gives us the best chance to win right now. And certainly we still want to see… — Jon Machota (@jonmachota) November 22, 2024  The Giants, who have lost their past five games, host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 12 and will move forward with a new starter at quarterback. Giants coach Brian Daboll announced Monday, after the team’s Week 11 bye, the Giants would make a change and will start Tommy DeVito on Sunday. “After evaluating and watching a lot of tape, that’s the reason we are going with Tommy,” Daboll said. “Drew Lock will be the backup. This was a necessary move for us, and I’m looking forward to working with Tommy, and he’ll be ready to go against Tampa Bay.” Advertisement My read on Daniel Jones’ release: It’s mutually beneficial, but the Giants weren’t going to make the first move. If Jones was fine showing up every day and going through the motions as QB4, they would have gone along with that. But once he asked out, they (obviously) were going to grant that wish. — Dan Duggan, Giants beat writer GO DEEPER Is Daniel Jones now QB4 on Giants depth chart? Drew Lock 'upset' he wasn't named starter Both the Giants and Jones will get a much-needed fresh start with the QB’s release. The Giants will close out the season with DeVito and Lock, but the focus now shifts to who will be the next face of the franchise. Right now, the Giants are No. 3 in the NFL Draft, per Tankathon. For now, there are three other two-win teams. The Giants would never openly tank, but in what’s supposed to be a less top-heavy QB draft, higher draft order could be paramount in finding Jones’ successor. While New York moves on, Jones finally can, too. When asked Thursday about the possibility of being released and playing with another team before season’s end, Jones said he was still focused on the Giants. He said he was “still processing and trying to think through what the best thing is for this team and what the best thing is for me.” If Daniel Jones is not claimed, a team could sign him after 4 PM on Monday. A more realistic scenario would be signing him on Tuesday or Wednesday.  He could also wait for a QB desperate team to bring him on. — Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) November 22, 2024  But now, the reality is Jones could play elsewhere. The question is, will he decide to do that and with which team? Some of the teams floating around social media that present the most intriguing options since they’re on the Giants’ remaining schedule: the Dallas Cowboys (Dak Prescott is out for the year and backup Cooper Rush has been struggling) and the Philadelphia Eagles (final game of the year where starters could potentially sit as the Eagles go on a playoff hunt). There are obviously other potential pairings, but those two present the most Shakespearean twists. — Charlotte Carroll, Giants beat writer Advertisement There is no impact for the Giants by releasing Jones now or after the season, since they’ll have plenty of cap space in 2025. The only possible cap impacts would be if the Giants waited until post-June 1 to make a cut, as The Athletic’s Dan Duggan noted. By doing so, the team would push $11.1 million in dead money to 2026. But the Giants wouldn’t have been able to spend that money until June, meaning they couldn’t have used those extra dollars in free agency when they matters most. Instead, the full $22.2 million in dead money goes into the 2025 cap year. And both parties get a much-needed fresh start with Jones’ decision to request the release. — Carroll (Photo: Al Bello / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,"While Formula 1 Thrives in Las Vegas, Small Businesses Feel the Strain",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938951/2024/11/22/f1-vegas-local-business-lawsuit-disruption/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:01:59 +0000",The construction of the circuit necessitates traffic restrictions and outright road closures that create significant gridlock throughout the city.,"Formula 1 LAS VEGAS — Jay’s Market On Flamingo is a corner gas station like so many others in and around Las Vegas, offering a little bit of everything. That it happens to be situated at the intersection of two of Las Vegas’ busiest roads makes it a convenient stop for out-of-towners needing supplies as they head in or out of the city. Advertisement However, in the past two Novembers, that convenience has been interrupted by the construction of the Las Vegas Grand Prix Formula One circuit incorporating 3.8 miles of city streets, necessitating traffic restrictions and outright road closures that create significant gridlock throughout the city. For Wade Bohn, the owner of Jay’s Market, located where Flamingo Road and Koval Lane cross, the congestion isn’t just a traffic nightmare but also a financial nightmare. His store is along the straightaway between Turns 4 and 5. “When I have no control over my business, succeeding or failing, yeah, I’m frustrated,” Bohn said. “I have no control. Literally, no control. For 13 years, I’ve had control of my business, been very profitable, made a great living for me and my employees. F1 comes to town, literally no business. It’s unbelievable and frustrating. “I can’t sleep at night.” As Bohn spoke, his anger was conveyed with his words, a quivering top lip and piercing blue eyes. He explained how the Las Vegas Grand Prix threatens his livelihood. In November 2022, the last time F1 didn’t race here, Jay’s Market had $628,000 in gross sales, Bohn said. The following year, however, sales in November fell considerably. As of this writing, he’s at $144,000 for this month. Overall, taking into account all the construction, road closures, snarled traffic and the closing of a sub shop that rented space inside the store at $4,000 a month, Bohn says he lost $3.4 million year-to-year from 2022 to 2023. And this year will be even worse. The culprit is mostly due to a race that Bohn and many other business owners in the area do not want to continue beyond this year, arguing that doing so will likely push them beyond their economic means. Already, Bohn has had to reduce his workforce by half and has started looking for a second job to help supplement his income. Advertisement “If there’s a fourth year (of the Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2026) I will bank on it that I will go into bankruptcy and lose my business,” Bohn said. “I am currently looking for work right now. Me, the owner, I need a job. I need to make money. I’m not making any money. It’s terrible.” Four lawsuits have been filed against Clark County by local business owners, including Bohn, seeking financial damages for negatively impacting their businesses. The Las Vegas Grand Prix declined comment related to any ongoing litigation. “We’re not like New York City where most everybody kind of lives in New York and where you can walk to work,” Lisa Mayo-DeRiso, a spokesperson for one group of business owners suing the county, told The Athletic. “Here, we have to drive to work or take the bus to work. People are having an hour to two hours to three hours a day extra to get to work and to get home. And F1 is not compensating anybody for those extra hours, babysitting time, time in your car, lost hours, lost time. They’re not compensating anybody for anything. They don’t believe that they should have to. “Our businesses have lost money.” Race organizers and Clark County have made considerable efforts to lessen the burden on local businesses, Lori Nelson-Kraft, senior vice president of corporate affairs for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, told The Athletic. Construction of the circuit for this year’s race was shorter than a year ago by 65 percent. And as much as possible, construction was done overnight to minimize disruption during busier hours. Representatives for the race have also met with local business owners, including Bohn, and they say they’re receptive to ideas that would further help the community. “We have adjusted plans based on that feedback,” Nelson-Kraft said. “So any of those businesses that participate have been able to have those forums to share that information and they are always included.” Advertisement One idea conceived to help ease traffic congestion was reducing the temporary bridge on Flamingo Road over Koval Lane from the four lanes it was last year to two. That bridge went up in October. “A lot of improvements have been made, and I will say that the restaurants that are in and around the circuit, specifically in that corridor, I have personally eaten at since the vehicular bridge has gone in,” Nelson-Kraft said. “And, anecdotally, while eating in that area there with my husband, I had conversations with their staff where they have shared with me, just as a guest of their venues, that they have seen remarkable improvements over last year.” According to Bohn, though, the bridge has yet to help. Instead, it effectively placed a wall around his store. Traffic flow is further backed to where even regular customers are deterred from stopping. At another small business in the area, a clerk (who asked not to be identified) took off his glasses and rubbed his temple when asked about the bridge. He followed by letting out an exasperated sigh, dropping an f-bomb and saying he didn’t have a comment other than to refer to the bridge by the derisive nickname used by some locals: “The Bridge to Bankruptcy.” “F1 tells me this is going to help me, but it looks like a three-story prison that’s covered in black tarp,” Bohn said. “There’s no access to my property from Koval, it’s completely shut off. I sit on a corner that has two access points when F1 is not here. I only have one when they’re here. When they’re here, it’s bad.” Said Mayo-DeRiso: “They put up that stupid bridge that cuts traffic. It absolutely impedes the flow of traffic.” Ideally, critics of the race would prefer the Las Vegas Grand Prix shift outside the city so that throughways no longer require being shut down. But the likelihood that Formula One would be willing to run on a circuit other than one that sees drivers speed down the Strip is a longshot, at best. The city and F1 have a 10-year contract. Advertisement According to Nelson-Kraft, last year’s inaugural grand prix had a $1.5 billion economic impact on the city. That figure outperformed expectations and the Super Bowl Las Vegas hosted in February, which generated $1 billion. Tax revenue from the race brought in $77 million, the most in Las Vegas history. Revenue projections for this year’s grand prix are lower than the 2023 edition, though they’re expected to remain robust. What that exact figure is won’t be known until weeks and months after Saturday night’s race. Three hundred thousand attendees are expected to turn through the gates across the three-day race weekend. “We are a tourism-driven economy, we are dependent on 150,000 plus hotel rooms filling up,” Nelson-Kraft said. “Special events are one of the big ways that we do it. And nobody hosts big events better than Las Vegas.” Standing in front of a drink cooler inside his store, Bohn wonders where all that money is going. None of it is being directed towards him, he said, while his bills continue to pile up due to an event he views as an unnecessary burden. “The s— pile keeps building up,” Bohn said. “I need this to go away. This nightmare goes away, I will sleep better.” (Top photo of Jay’s Market owner Wade Bohn: K.M.

The two were scheduled to meet for an hour between the U.S. women’s national team’s semifinal win and its eventual gold medal victory over Brazil. While they had met before, they had never spoken at length. Advertisement Three hours later, the two were still there, not just talking, but in the weeds on big, foundational ideas around the women’s program. When they finally parted ways, they left with the seed of an idea that would eventually turn into the second-largest donation U.S. Soccer has received. On Tuesday, U.S. Soccer announced Kang — majority owner of the Washington Spirit, Olympique Lyonnais Féminin and London City Lionesses under her global multi-club organization Kynisca — was donating $30million (£24m). The funds are earmarked over the next five years for women’s youth national team camps, talent identification and scouting, and female coach and referee education and mentorship. GO DEEPER Spirit owner Kang pledges $30million into women's soccer programs “I had a lot of coffee,” Kang deadpanned when asked about that Paris breakfast during an interview following Tuesday’s press conference in New York City. “Michele started asking really good, insightful questions on things and ultimately got to some core issues,” Batson told The Athletic. Kang wanted to know how U.S. Soccer was thinking at a federation-wide level and Batson walked her through the long-term vision, even if that vision didn’t have secured funding and resources attached yet. These questions had been on Kang’s mind for years since she gained majority ownership of the Spirit in 2022. She knew the NWSL would need more coaches and more referees with expansion and more games. She could see the lack of technical staff at the youth levels around D.C., too. “While the professional league and professional teams’ trajectory and investments are great, it could be really temporary if we don’t have all these underlying foundational blocks,” she said. It wasn’t just the investment that needed to happen, it was attention — but that wasn’t on her alone or the NWSL. When the breakfast meeting in Paris happened, Kang had finally found an avenue for those ambitions. Advertisement “We geeked out for a few hours on what the mission-critical, core-enabling functions that we’re going to need for soccer in this country, and women’s soccer in particular, to be the best in the world,” Batson continued. “And everything led from there.” While Tuesday’s announcement earned its fair share of attention, the eye-popping investment is to be used in areas of U.S. Soccer that don’t get a lot of shine and certainly won’t get a lot of headlines over the next five years as the work is carried out. That was a motivation for Kang in many ways — this isn’t for splashy projects, such as the national training center. “It is equally — potentially more — critical that we have all the systems in place. Because if you don’t have the coaches, if you don’t have the referees, it just doesn’t work,” she said. “That’s why I felt it was important that not only I personally believe in it, but I wanted to bring attention to these issues, hoping that more people will join in and invest in it.” Kang is not one to accept things as final. “I hate following any convention if they say, ‘You’re not supposed to do it.’ I always asked why it wasn’t acceptable. So unless I understood the rationale, I wouldn’t do it,” she told The Athletic in an interview conducted in May 2022, shortly after she became the majority owner of the Washington Spirit. “So in that society where young people, especially kids, are supposed to follow the rules, I was a problem child.” Growing up as the youngest of three girls in South Korea, Kang was more curious than rebellious, always asking why. Her mother was called to her school multiple times, not because Kang was causing trouble — she was a top student — but because she would question teachers, rules and expectations. Kang’s parents had been waiting for a boy who could carry the family name. She arrived instead. She has credited her father for instilling a sense of equality and possibility in her from the beginning. He was a professor, one of the first Koreans after the Second World War who earned a U.S. government scholarship to study in America, which also meant he didn’t serve in the Korean War. Advertisement Kang was a self-described tomboy growing up. She played sports, a lot of them. Basketball was her favorite. In elementary school, she was the second tallest kid in her class. “I was going to be a basketball player, but I found out there was somebody the same age as me who played basketball in another school. She was already 6ft 2in and I said, ‘Well, I’m never going to be number one, forget it,’” Kang recalled. She played soccer and volleyball, but tennis became her primary sport before the need to study won out. Kang planned to earn her college degree at home. While her father had studied abroad in America, her parents wanted her to graduate from a Korean college to help preserve her cultural identity. She started at a co-ed college of economics, but she was the only woman enrolled. Things in South Korea were also tumultuous at the time. President Park Chung-hee was assassinated in 1979, followed by a coup led by General Chun Doo-hwan. Chun arrested his political opponents and limited political opposition. Martial law was put in place and student-led protests were violently suppressed. “The country was in turmoil. Campuses were shut down because typically, students were at the forefront of the demonstrations,” she said. Her parents were worried that if Kang was involved in those demonstrations, or arrested, it would be the end of her life as she knew it. So she devised a plan. Her parents would eventually be responsible for a dowry if she married. Instead, she told them, “When I get married, you don’t need to spend a dime. Just give me a fraction of that money so that I can pay my tuition, just one year, as a college student.” While she believed her parents would have usually said no — they had to borrow money to pay for that year of tuition — the worry over her future amid the demonstrations and dangerous political unrest got her a yes. Advertisement “I guess you could say that was my first business deal,” she said with a smile. When she got to the University of Chicago in 1981, she thrived. She turned one year into two, working in the summer as a waitress and adding a second job at the library once the semester rolled around. “There was a sitcom, ‘Cheers,’” she said. “The song, ‘You want to go where everybody knows your name’ — I wanted to go where no one knew my name because of where I grew up. With my father as a professor, I was always so and so’s daughter, so and so’s granddaughter. I absolutely hated it. I really wanted to go somewhere where no one knew who I was. If I fail, I fail, but at least it’s going to be on me as opposed to getting any special treatment.” She loved the school, loved the feel of the campus and the quad that reminded her of Oxford University. She would walk back and forth, believing she’d get smarter by absorbing the energy of the place. She went to graduate school at Yale School of Management. Coming out of her MBA, Kang said she had three 10-year plans. In the first 10, she wanted to go into consulting because the project-based nature of the work appealed to her. One day it would be supply chains, the next branding, the day after that telecommunications or manufacturing. She wanted to learn how every element of a business works. The next 10 years, even though she hated the concept, she would go to a Fortune 500 company to learn the organizational part of being in the business world and to acquire leadership skills. “At the end of the day, business is not about how smart you are, how many functional capabilities or the expertise you have, it’s about organization,” Kang said. “How do you get people below you, sideways from you, above you, how do you get them to do what you need them to do? How can you get them to work with you to accomplish common goals?” And in the third decade, she was going to become a Fortune 500 CEO. Advertisement “That’s also why I left Korea, right?” Kang said. “I could have gotten my business career going, but I wanted to try in a bigger pond.” In the end, instead of becoming a CEO, she started her own company, Cognoscente — a healthcare technology company — in 2008. She effectively did what she set out to do, even if she didn’t nail her own timeline. Kang had a plan for the fourth decade, too: giving back and public service. And in 2019, she found women’s soccer. After the U.S. won the 2019 Women’s World Cup, while also fighting for equal pay, there was a reception for the team on Capitol Hill. Tom Daschle, the former Democratic senator from South Dakota, who also served on the Cognoscente board, invited Kang. Daschle would eventually join the Spirit investor group a couple of years later, under the team’s previous ownership. “To tell you the truth, I didn’t know there was a professional league in this country,” Kang told The Athletic in 2022. “In part because my life had been all about work. I didn’t have time to do anything else.” She met Steve Baldwin, then the majority owner of the Spirit, at the reception, along with players and fellow potential investors. By December 2020, she joined as a minority investor with a 35 percent stake in the team. The soccer part was nice, but what appealed to her most was having a hands-on impact on women’s empowerment, especially around pay and equity issues. Four things had helped her through her journey, she said: “Dignity of work, dignity of self, independence and being able to get the same opportunity.” With women’s soccer, she could provide opportunities. But the path to becoming the first woman of color to own a majority stake in the NWSL was not straightforward. In 2021, negotiations for her to gain a controlling stake of the Spirit turned sour between her, Baldwin, and the other primary investor, Bill Lynch. When she made a $35million offer to buy the Spirit in December of that year, it was unheard of for the league. The expansion fee for the Kansas City Current had been a mere $5million; the sale of the majority stake of the Seattle Reign to Lyon in 2019 had been completed at a valuation of $3.51million. Advertisement Those numbers seem quaint now, but the astronomical rise in NWSL team valuations wouldn’t have happened in the same way without that first $35million offer from Kang. Over the past couple of years, her international ambitions came to fruition via a global multi-club organization. It started with a majority stake in Lyon’s women’s team, one of the best European club teams with regular Champions League appearances. Then she snapped up one of the few independent clubs in the top two flights of the English soccer pyramid, the London City Lionesses. The formal announcement of the multi-club organization came this summer, with Kynisca announcing its name and an “innovation hub” focused on the health and performance of women athletes, billed to be the largest of its kind. Kang, via Kynisca, also led a $2million investment in Ida Sports, which designs cleats and shoes for female players, and invested in media company Just Women’s Sports. She also joined the investor group that bought the Baltimore Orioles earlier this year at a $1.725billion valuation. Kang has also branched into other women’s sports with another deal that happened at the Paris Olympics, donating $4million over the next four years to USA Rugby to support the women’s sevens team leading into the 2028 Olympics. USA Rugby called her donation “transformative.” That deal came together even faster than the one with U.S. Soccer. Kang walked into the sold-out Stade de France, surprised by the atmosphere. She ended up next to the chair of USA Rugby and they struck up a conversation. “It was literally the most expensive game I’ve ever been to,” Kang joked Tuesday. “I really did not expect to do that. But I just felt that (the team is) so talented that they should not be deprived of investment and just like what I’ve been trying to do in my own small way, bring attention and hope people begin to see it, and more people will join.”     A post shared by Washington Spirit (@washingtonspirit)  That’s the way Kang usually talks about her larger projects: as some small way of changing the game. But for all the praise she gets, there are still skeptics of her motives and her methods — especially the multi-club model. She’s addressed at least one of those critiques head-on. “I am fully aware of the negative connotation of multi-club (ownership), especially on the men’s side,” Kang said following her purchase of London City. “I will submit to you that on the women’s side, multi-club is a necessity, not luxury or greed. Because we need to invest to professionalize women’s football to the level that they deserve and the potential that women’s football has. We need to invest. Because of the lack of media dollars, there isn’t that much money to invest.” Advertisement After Tuesday’s $30million announcement, it’s harder for critics to accuse Kang of acting in bad faith. Still, she has the edge of ruthlessness regarding business; she wants to make money at this. It’s never been a charity. Instead, she saw an opening and was among the first to leap. She also knows there are risks. Kang doesn’t believe in guaranteed outcomes, just opportunities. “This is a tipping point. Once it happens, it’s on its own trajectory. You can’t stop it,” she said Tuesday. “But we have to make sure we’re investing in the right things at the right time. Otherwise, this could fall apart.” One of those investments is doing just fine. After going to New York City to announce her U.S. Soccer donation, Kang headed to Kansas City to watch her first team, the Spirit, vie for the NWSL championship against the top-seeded Orlando Pride on Saturday night. She’s feeling the nerves, especially after two late winning goals in the playoffs at a sold-out Audi Field. “I kept telling the players after the quarterfinal and the semifinal that at this rate, I don’t think I’m going to live out my natural life span,” Kang said laughing. “I only have one heart.” Pablo Maurer contributed to this report.

NYT > Sports,N.F.L. Flexes First Game Into ‘Thursday Night Football’ Slot,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940748/2024/11/22/broncos-vs-chargers-tnf-flex-week-16/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:01:59 +0000",The Denver Broncos’ Week 16 matchup at the Los Angeles Chargers has been moved into prime time on December 19.,"NFL By Nick Kosmider, Daniel Popper and Zac Jackson The NFL has flexed a game into a “Thursday Night Football” for the first time, moving the Denver Broncos’ Week 16 matchup at the Los Angeles Chargers into prime time on Dec. 19. The two teams, led by former Oregon quarterbacks Bo Nix and Justin Herbert, were originally set to play on Sunday afternoon, Dec. 22. The Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals game that was originally slated for Thursday night will now be played that Sunday at 1 p.m. ET on Fox. GO DEEPER Broncos' biggest turnaround this side of Bo Nix: A run defense with real bite NFL owners approved a rule change in 2023 that allowed games to be flexed into a Thursday slot between Weeks 13 and 17, with such moves requiring a four-week notice. The matchup means the Broncos will now play two prime-time games in December, the first coming against the Browns on “Monday Night Football” in Week 13. The matchup against the Chargers will give a national audience a look at Nix, who won the AFC Offensive Player of the Week award following his four-touchdown performance in a Week 11 rout of the Atlanta Falcons. Advertisement The Chargers, meanwhile, have won five out of their last six games under first-year head coach Jim Harbaugh — the first of those coming in a Week 6 win against the Broncos — and remain in the hunt for the AFC West title. The Broncos, who already played a Thursday night road game earlier this season against the New Orleans Saints, had to OK being flexed since this will be their second road Thursday night game of the season. They are embracing the switch, in part, because it will give them extended rest heading into a pivotal Week 17 road game against the Bengals. “We’d rather be flexed in than flexed out,” said Broncos coach Sean Payton. “It’s a real good team that is playing real good (football). And it flexes Cincinnati out, who we play the next week, so there is a little (rest consideration). It is what it is.” Payton said his 2006 Saints team was the first one to flexed into a Sunday night matchup, against the Dallas Cowboys, but he downplayed the history of being the first team flexed into a Thursday slot. “It’s all good,” he said. “Just tell us when we’re playing.” The Chargers have now been flexed into prime time for the second time this season. Their Week 11 matchup with the Bengals was moved from Sunday afternoon to Sunday night. That ended up being an epic game, with the Bengals erasing a 21-point second-half deficit before the Chargers pulled it out late on Herbert’s 15th career game-winning drive. GO DEEPER Justin Herbert paces Chargers in 23-16 win vs. Broncos: Takeaways The Chargers are interesting. The Chargers are exciting. They are good for business. And now, they will be playing four prime-time games in a six-week stretch, starting with last week’s Bengals game. They host the Baltimore Ravens on Monday night in Week 12. They play at the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday night in Week 14. — Daniel Popper, Chargers beat writer
 Advertisement Nix had a slow start to the season, throwing only one touchdown and four interceptions across his first four games. Since then, he’s arguably been the best rookie quarterback in the NFL (13 touchdowns, two interceptions), putting him firmly alongside players like Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels and Las Vegas Raiders tight end Brock Bowers in the Rookie of the Year race. The “Thursday Night Football” stage will give Nix the opportunity to make a major statement. This will be the third matchup between Nix and Herbert, including a college clash in 2019, when Herbert was at Oregon and Nix was a true freshman starter at Auburn. Nix led a late touchdown drive to win that game at AT&T Stadium in Dallas. Herbert came out on top in Week 6 this season. — Nick Kosmider, Broncos beat writer The Bengals aren’t out of contention yet, but from a playoff appeal standpoint, the move makes sense. The Bengals are probably disappointed because the home team has won nine straight AFC North Thursday night games dating back to 2015, a streak the Browns extended with their upset of the Steelers Thursday night. The Browns now could be looking at back-to-back flex situations; they’re currently scheduled to host Miami on Sunday night in Week 17. — Zac Jackson, Browns beat writer (Photo: Dustin Bradford / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,Conference Championship and College Football Playoff Implications Dominate Week 13,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938781/2024/11/22/college-football-schedule-week-13-top-games/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:01:59 +0000",Two weeks remain in the regular season. These are the top games to watch.,"NCAAF With two weeks remaining in the regular season, the schedule is brimming with conference championship and College Football Playoff implications, including undefeated underdogs, a crowded SEC race, potential chaos in the Big 12 and a top-five Big Ten clash between Indiana and Ohio State. Let’s rank the top 10 games of Week 12, starting with honorable mentions and counting down. Advertisement Honorable Mention: No. 24 UNLV at San Jose State (Fri.), No. 25 Illinois at Rutgers, Sam Houston at Jacksonville State, Western Kentucky at Liberty, Kentucky at No. 3 Texas, Wisconsin at Nebraska, Washington State at Oregon State, No. 22 Iowa State at Utah. (All point spreads come from BetMGM; click here for live odds. All kickoff times are Eastern and on Saturday unless otherwise noted.) This is a sneaky significant game in the CFP race. UNLV is 24th in the CFP rankings, but Colorado State is above the Rebels in the Mountain West standings at 5-0 and in second place behind No. 12 Boise State. The Broncos, who are currently projected into a top-four seed and first-round bye in the Playoff bracket, could benefit from another win against a ranked UNLV in the Mountain West championship, but CSU controls UNLV’s odds to get there. Margins are thin: Boise State facing the unranked Rams instead of the ranked Rebels could be the difference between a first-round road trip and first-round bye, depending on how things play out in the ACC and Big 12. Before we can get to any of that, Colorado State is a road underdog at Fresno. Line: Fresno State -3.5 The Mustangs can lock up a spot in the ACC championship game with one win over the next two weeks. Miami, which hosts Wake Forest, needs to win out, with Clemson lurking and hoping for a stumble or two. Odds are that SMU will win its way into the conference championship, but the CFP jockeying is a factor as well. The Mustangs are currently just outside the 12-team field, and will need to win out the regular season in convincing fashion — and maybe see a couple of two-loss SEC teams slip up? — if they want to maintain any chance at an at-large spot. Advertisement Line: SMU -9.5 Penn State has lost its last two trips to Minnesota, including in 2019 when the Nittany Lions were also fourth in the CFP rankings. While still mathematically alive in the Big Ten race, it’s doubtful Penn State will sneak into the conference championship. It also has a rather pedestrian resume despite its top-four ranking — hooray helmet bias! — and may not be able to hang in the Playoff picture with a second loss. The mercurial Gophers, who had won four in a row before a recent loss to Rutgers, will try to test that theorem in a semi-rivalry matchup with a forgotten trophy. Line: Penn State -11.5  The Rebels’ chances of reaching the SEC championship are minuscule, but Ole Miss is sitting pretty in the CFP standings and is in line for an at-large bid if it can avoid a third loss over the next two weeks. Quarterback Jaxson Dart is 373 yards shy of eclipsing Eli Manning as Ole Miss’s career passing leader and could set the record with a big day against the Gators. But Florida is fresh off a nice upset of LSU despite being out-possessed by the Tigers 41:43 to 18:17. After suffering weeks of Billy Napier hot-seat drama, the Gators are one win away from reaching bowl eligibility and can shake up the Playoff race with another upset on Saturday. Line: Ole Miss -10 It’s been quite the ride for Alabama, between the wild win over Georgia, losses to Vanderbilt and Tennessee, and then resounding wins over Missouri and LSU. After all that, the Tide are well-positioned to reach the SEC championship in Kalen DeBoer’s first season at the helm, with the Sooners on the road and the Iron Bowl in Tuscaloosa left on the schedule. Advertisement Entering the weekend, winning out doesn’t guarantee Bama a spot in the title game, but that’s the most likely destination. The Sooners have a top-20 defense at 4.8 yards per play allowed, so we’ll see if an Oklahoma team that’s lost four straight to FBS opponents can slow down Alabama and quarterback Jalen Milroe, who has 32 total touchdowns for the season. Line: Alabama -13.5 The Aggies, who haven’t even appeared in a conference championship since winning the Big 12 back in 1998, fully control their own destiny in the SEC with two games remaining. Next week at home against Texas is the big one, but A&M can’t get caught looking past a disappointing Auburn team that is less than a field-goal underdog on its own field. Texas A&M appears to be sticking with redshirt freshman Marcel Reed at quarterback, who has struggled at times as a passer but is a dangerous runner. Line: Texas A&M -2.5 All that attention on Colorado and head coach Deion Sanders last year and to start this season, and yet it now feels as if this team is underappreciated. The Buffs have won four in a row and seven of their last eight, making them another team that controls its own fate in the conference standings. If Colorado wins out, it’s going to the Big 12 championship, where a victory would send the program to the CFP. That’s a long way from 4-8 and dead last in the Pac-12 a season ago. First up is a trip to Arrowhead Stadium against a Kansas squad that fought back from a dreadful start to play Big 12 spoiler, toppling Iowa State and then-undefeated BYU in its last two games. The Jayhawks are eliminated from the Big 12 race but can still reach bowl eligibility and spark some additional turmoil in the process. Line: Colorado -3 Advertisement Army is one of three remaining undefeated teams in FBS, and a potential Playoff disruptor out of the AAC if it can remain unbeaten, including a nonconference upset of Notre Dame. That will be a tough task against the sixth-ranked Irish, who knocked off service academy Navy a few weeks ago in a 51-14 blowout. The Army-Notre Dame rivalry, which dates to 1913, “returns” to Yankee Stadium for the first time since 2010 — where it was played in Old Yankee Stadium for many years. The most recent meeting was at the Alamodome in San Antonio in 2016, a 44–6 victory for Notre Dame and part of a 15-game win streak over Army that stretches to 1965. The Irish can’t afford another loss if they want to stay in Playoff contention, and will need their top-five defense to shut down Army’s triple option, which accounts for the nation’s top rushing offense (334.9 yards per game). Line: Notre Dame -14.5 The Big 12’s chaos narrative has become cliche at this point, yet nobody had this one circled as the league’s game of the year entering the season. A BYU program that won five games in 2023 and was picked near the bottom of the league, against an Arizona State team that was picked dead-last out of 16 schools, facing off in late November with a spot in the Big 12 championship essentially up for grabs. The league’s title race and Playoff scenarios are a little murky after BYU dropped from No. 6 to No. 14 in the rankings following last week’s loss, but the Cougars have a physical defense and do-or-die offense. It should make for a fun battle against the assertive (and favored) Sun Devils led by human wrecking ball Cam Skattebo at running back. Line: Arizona State -3 College football is ruthless. For whatever reason, the conversation on Indiana shifted from feel-good story of the season to possible Playoff fraud in a matter of days. It’s gone from “Can anyone beat Indiana?” to “Who has Indiana beaten?” Whether you’re a Hoosier hater or believer, we’re about to get an answer. Undefeated IU travels to Ohio State for yet another top-five showdown, with the winner well on its way to facing Oregon in the Big Ten championship and a lock for the CFP. The Hoosiers have ripped off a dominant 10-game run, but much of it came against the bottom of the Big Ten standings. Now they’re heavy underdogs against the second-ranked Buckeyes, and Indiana’s resume is arguably weak enough to knock the Hoosiers out of the 12-team Playoff picture with a loss. Or Indiana could prove the doubters wrong and put Ohio State — and its depleted offensive line — on the bubble. Either way, it’s a matchup between two of the top teams in the sport that will have massive postseason ramifications. That’s a conversation worth having.

NYT > Sports,The Steelers Have 2 Quarterbacks and Too Many Unanswered Questions,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5939916/2024/11/22/russell-wilson-justin-fields-steelers-browns/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:01:59 +0000","Even beyond the negative plays, Pittsburgh’s offense has become too boom or bust, a columnist for The Athletic writes.","NFL CLEVELAND — As the flakes tumbled from the night sky, turning Huntington Bank Field into a snow globe, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson dropped back and let it fly. The pass, thrown with anticipation, found receiver Calvin Austin III on time and on target in the end zone for the go-ahead, 23-yard touchdown. After failing to score a touchdown for more than seven consecutive quarters dating to Week 10 against the Washington Commanders, Pittsburgh had scored two in less than two minutes to take a one-point lead over the Cleveland Browns with 6:15 remaining. .@DangeRussWilson ➡️ @CalvinAustinIII for six!!!! 📲 Stream on NFL+: https://t.co/COxKRnr6Mc pic.twitter.com/ucLP4kE2cM — Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) November 22, 2024  It was a miraculous comeback. Until it wasn’t. “The game is never won until you get on the bus,” Austin said after the game. “So it was definitely an emotional moment (after the touchdown). We were all hype and stuff. But we knew we had an inspired team that was about to get the ball back.” As it turned out, the Browns got the ball back not once, but twice. Advertisement The Steelers’ defense did its job the first time, forcing backup quarterback Jameis Winston into an errant pass that cornerback Donte Jackson intercepted with 4:22 to go. But after Pittsburgh went three-and-out — with Justin Fields in for Wilson at quarterback on second and third down — and Corliss Waitman shanked a punt for the first time as a Steeler, the defense couldn’t get off the field again. Cleveland got the ball back with 3:22 remaining and drove 45 yards in nine plays. The Browns capped the sequence with a 2-yard Nick Chubb touchdown with 57 seconds remaining, then batted down Wilson’s Hail Mary as time expired to stun the Steelers, 24-19. GO DEEPER Browns stun Steelers 24-19 in snow as Chubb scores late TD: Takeaways A team that made a statement by beating the Baltimore Ravens just four days earlier dropped to 8-3, leaving the door open in the competitive AFC North. “Missed opportunities,” defensive co-captain Cameron Hayward said. “We have to eat it. They made more plays at the end. Some of that stuff we can have some head-scratching about what was on display. Just take it, move on. I know everybody is pretty pissed off about the loss.” The weighty moments at the end of the game loom large: coach Mike Tomlin’s decision to accept an illegal touching penalty that gave the Browns a second crack at third down on the final drive, then spending a timeout that would be needed later; the coverage on the ensuing third-and-6 conversion; the decision to tackle Chubb on the 2-yard line with more than 90 seconds remaining instead of letting him score to preserve time and get the ball back. But the reality is this game was lost much earlier, on the other side of the ball. “We beat ourselves with a lot of mistakes,” Austin said. “That takes all 11 looking in the mirror and just continuing to push details. They’re a good team. Got to give them credit. But at the end of the day, we just got to perform better.” Advertisement Two weeks ago, when Wilson erased a 10-point, second-half deficit against the Commanders, it appeared the offense had finally figured it out after years of instability and inconsistency. At the time, the veteran signal caller had led the Steelers to 31.7 points and 382 total yards per game through three starts. If the offense continued along the same trajectory, it was reasonable to consider the Steelers legitimate Super Bowl contenders that could stand toe-to-toe with Patrick Mahomes or Josh Allen. But it hasn’t continued. If those first three games showed the explosive upside of Wilson’s moonball, his veteran presence and his ability to make checks at the line of scrimmage, the past two have revealed many of the Steelers’ offensive warts. It’s certainly not all on Wilson. However, sacks are becoming problematic, putting the offense behind the chains. This was an obvious area of concern the minute the Steelers signed Wilson, considering he led the NFL in sacks taken in two of the previous five seasons. Initially, when he took over for Fields in Week 7, the Steelers did well enough to protect Wilson that it wasn’t a major red flag. However, in the first half alone on Thursday, Wilson was sacked four times, as the Browns kept the Steelers’ offensive line off balance with stunts and games up front. Three of those sacks came from Myles Garrett, including a strip-sack that set the Browns up on a short field. Myles strips the ball and we recover it 🙌😤 #PITvsCLE | @NFLonPrime pic.twitter.com/36WalR8R8h — Cleveland Browns (@Browns) November 22, 2024  Even beyond the negative plays, Pittsburgh’s offense has become too boom or bust. Yes, once again, Wilson’s deep shot was a catalyst. He connected with Austin on a 46-yard bomb up the seam, hit Van Jefferson on a 35-yard gain and found George Pickens for 31 yards. Those big plays helped bolster what was a solid stat line from Wilson, as he completed 21 of 28 passes for 270 yards and a touchdown with no interceptions for a 116.7 passer rating. Advertisement The problem is, when the Steelers aren’t producing touchdowns on these deep shots, they’re having a hard time finishing drives. The issues emerged on the opening drive. On third down, Wilson took an 8-yard sack on third-and-2, turning a potential 50-yard field goal attempt into a 58-yarder that the reliable Chris Boswell missed. The Steelers, who rank 26th in success rate (37.2 percent, per TruMedia) since Wilson took over, tried to use every resource available to keep the offense going. However, another first-half drive was halted on the 40-yard line. This time, they deployed Fields on a fourth-and-2 QB keeper, failing and turning the ball over on downs. The offense also fizzled at the 30 (made field goal), its own 46 (failed fourth-and-1 run by Jaylen Warren) and the Cleveland 9-yard line (made field goal). “We had some really good, explosive plays down the field, throwing the ball with Van (Jefferson) — he made some great catches — and Calvin (Austin),” Wilson said. “And then we got stalled for whatever reasons. We’ve got to watch the film and see what that was. … We needed one or two more plays.” Complicating matters is the unique quarterback dynamic. After utilizing the Fields package for three plays on Sunday against the Ravens, the Steelers featured their mobile QB on seven snaps (plus an eighth that didn’t happen because of a false start) on Thursday. The results were mixed. After coming up short on fourth down early in the game, Fields provided a second-half spark when he kept the ball on a zone read and raced 30 yards along the right sideline. That played helped jump-start the offense, and later in the same drive, the threat of Fields keeping the ball on the zone read helped Warren burst into the end zone to snap the Steelers’ touchdown-less skid and kindle the rally. Jaylen Warren in for the TD! The @Steelers answer right back.#PITvsCLE on Prime VideoAlso streaming on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/aDPce0i8CM — NFL (@NFL) November 22, 2024  The Steelers also put the ball in Fields’ hands in a four-minute situation with the lead. It was a reasonable time to play the running quarterback, with the Steelers trying to burn the clock. However, on third-and-4, his deep shot for Pickens sailed incomplete, stopping the clock and giving the Browns plenty of time to score the go-ahead touchdown. Asked if he would have liked to be in the game in that critical moment, Wilson was somewhat transparent. Advertisement “Listen, I always want to be in there,” he said. “That’s just the competitor in me. But at the same time, we have great trust in Justin, our team, our coaches and everything we’re doing.” It’s also not the easiest challenge for Fields. He said after the game that he felt “kind of stiff” on his 30-yard run after standing on the sideline for the entirety of the second and third quarters, adding he felt he could have scored on the play. Asked if it’s difficult to enter the game mid-stream and virtually without warning, Fields admitted it is. “But at the end of the day, that’s what my job is,” he said. “So you can’t complain. Anytime I get a chance and an opportunity to go on the field and help my team, I’m happy to do it.” Sitting behind a keyboard and watching the game from the press box, it’s honestly hard to say what the right balance should be. Fields has often been the Steelers’ best offensive weapon, and his mobility might be able to help them rectify their red zone woes. Using both quarterbacks allows the Steelers to adjust on the fly if the offense needs a jolt or if the opposing pass rush is becoming too big of a factor. On the other hand, it does seem that, at times, rotating quarterbacks can disrupt the passers’ rhythm and timing. Still, it’s important to remember that the Steelers got to 8-2 thanks to the contributions of both players. If they’re going to prove that this two-game stretch of offensive woes was a blip on the radar, and that this offense can in fact provide an edge in the postseason, they’re probably going to need to continue to use both. Finding that right balance and rediscovering a way to finish drives will help determine how far this offense — and the team as a whole — goes. “We’ve got a lot of football left,” Wilson said. “We’ve got a lot of opportunities to respond in the highest way, highest level. I think that everything that we want is still in front of us.” (Photo of Russell Wilson: Kevin Sabitus / Getty Images) Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

NYT > Sports,Odell Beckham Jr. Made a One-Handed Catch. It Changed His Life Forever.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936972/2024/11/22/odell-beckham-one-handed-catch-giants/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:01:59 +0000","In 2014, Beckham Jr. was a talented rookie. Then he became a “celebrity overnight.”","NFL One of the most iconic catches in NFL history — a play that would change Odell Beckham Jr.’s life — started with a misunderstanding and a poor route. Eli Manning is quick to remind his former New York Giants receiver of both whenever the play comes up. And it always does. It’s one of the more indelible moments in the NFL over the last decade. Advertisement “It was kind of like bad, bad, bad … unbelievable. Or, oh, no, no, no … great job,” Manning said. “We laugh more about that. I recognize how good it was and eventually get to (acknowledging) that point, but with your pals, it’s always good to give them a little heat about what it could have been. It could have been a walk-in: double move, beat him by 5 yards, nice easy catch and cruise in for an easy touchdown. “But that’s not the Odell way.” For weeks during the 2014 season, Giants players and coaches learned about the “Odell way.” They watched a precocious rookie in practice snatch balls out of the air with a swipe of his hand. They saw him throw, punt and kick field goals, effortlessly launching footballs to improbable depths. They witnessed him nonchalantly perform eye-popping, athletic feats as if he had been doing them all of his life. His former Giants teammate, inside linebacker Jameel McClain, remembers watching Beckham and thinking, “Man, God really did a number on him.” On Nov. 23, 2014, a MetLife Stadium crowd of more than 80,000 and a prime-time NBC television audience learned what the Giants already knew: Beckham was capable of the extraordinary. His one-handed — check that, three-fingered — 43-yard touchdown catch against the Dallas Cowboys on a ball that sailed behind his head electrified the world and transformed Beckham from an exciting, talented rookie into a sports phenom. “During the moment, I didn’t know the magnitude of what actually happened,” Beckham said. “I only know the aftermath. It’s been my life ever since.” The Catch That Broke the Internet. Odell Beckham Jr. catches a one-handed touchdown and it is arguably one of the most iconic catches in NFL history. (via @nflthrowback)pic.twitter.com/SAchXm5uCv — NBC Sports (@NBCSports) December 22, 2019  Beckham says that with a tone of acceptance, but also a tinge of regret. He appreciates the fame and fortune that the catch helped generate. He also resents that the catch is used to minimize the other accomplishments of his career. In many ways, Beckham and his most celebrated play have a love-hate relationship. Advertisement He’s 32 now, no longer a phenom but a veteran of 10 NFL seasons. The Miami Dolphins are his fifth team. He is closing in on 600 career catches, 8,000 receiving yards and 60 touchdowns. He might have been the MVP of the Los Angeles Rams’ Super Bowl LVI victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in February 2022 had his left knee not given out, forcing him to miss the rest of the game and the entire next season, altering his football future. Yet, the one play that has largely defined his career happened exactly 10 years ago Saturday. Beckham’s catch while being interfered with by Cowboys cornerback Brandon Carr adorns countless highlight reels and is commemorated on T-shirts and posters on the walls of sports bars and man caves. It inspired scores of imposters and flashy one-handed catches to come. A decade later, his connection with Manning is typically the yardstick for which all other acrobatic one-handed catches, such as the one Garrett Wilson of the New York Jets made late last month, are measured. CATCH OF THE YEAR CANDIDATE FROM GARRETT WILSON @nyjets pic.twitter.com/A3efxJMIiF — The Athletic (@TheAthletic) November 1, 2024 
“There’s always something about the original, and it was the first time I had seen something like that,” said Cris Collinsworth, the longtime NFL receiver who was in the NBC booth providing color commentary with Al Michaels for the Giants-Cowboys game. “Today, between the gloves, the balls aren’t as slick and these guys are freakier athletes. These guys are 6-4, 225 pounds, and they run 4.3 (seconds in the 40-yard dash). It’s just insane what they are able to do, so I try not to get so freaked out about it anymore. “But yeah, when it happened, I thought (Beckham’s catch) was the best thing that I’d ever seen.” It’s stood the test of time, too. Beckham remembers it vividly. He was playing for LSU against Auburn in 2013 when he soared above the far sideline and tried to make a one-handed snag. He couldn’t haul it in, but he vowed that he’d make that play the next time the opportunity arose. His inspiration came from LSU teammate Jarvis Landry. The two would spend hours outside their college dorm, throwing footballs to each other and practicing one-handed catches. “That’s really how it came about,” Beckham said. “It really was a lot of Jarvis’ doing as far as the way he took me being a kid who was going to be good to understanding that I want to be a legend. I want to be remembered forever.” Advertisement The 12th pick of the 2014 NFL Draft, Beckham didn’t get  his professional career off to a great start. A hamstring injury sidelined him for much of training camp and the first four games of the regular season. “He had a rocky start, and that New York media wasn’t friendly to him,” McClain said. “I remember having so many different conversations with him, like, ‘All of this is going to pass by, and the time that the world sees who you are is going to come.'” In his regular-season debut, Beckham caught the game-winning touchdown pass against the Atlanta Falcons. Two weeks later, he had two touchdowns against the Cowboys. In the three games after that, he totaled 21 catches for 357 yards. Beckham already had caught a 3-yard touchdown pass from Manning midway through the first quarter in the rematch against the Cowboys in Week 12 on “Sunday Night Football.” The Giants had designs on more when they had a first down on the Cowboys’ 43-yard line. It was the area of the field where Giants offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo liked to take deep shots, and the offense had been working extensively on different throws off bootlegs. One, in particular, called for Beckham to make an out-and-up move down the sideline. As the first quarter ended, the coaches and Manning discussed the merits of a deep shot. Giants head coach Tom Coughlin wasn’t sure it was the best time to try it. Beckham pleaded with Coughlin to keep the call. “We were trying to figure out what shot to take, and that was one of the shots on the menu,” McAdoo said. “Good thing we didn’t talk ourselves out of that one.” As Beckham jogged back on the field, it was either Coughlin or Manning who said, “Don’t rush the route.” It, however, was the last three of those words that stuck in Beckham’s head as he lined up outside and to Manning’s right: rush the route. Advertisement “We wanted to get a little comeback and go, and we were a little worried if we just did a straight fake and rollout, it would bring the safety over. So, we just kind of did a half roll,” Manning recalled. “I want to take my eyes to the middle safety, hold him a little bit and have a backside post. Pretend that you’re looking at that and then gear up, and you’re throwing the comeback and go no matter what. If we’re getting high (safety), it should be one-on-one. We got the look that we wanted.” Beckham, indeed, rushed the route and didn’t sell the comeback. Carr wasn’t fooled, either. He was stride-for-stride with Beckham tracking the flight of Manning’s pass. “Definitely not one of my best routes,” Beckham said. “He tried to squeeze me to the sideline, and I kind of did a basketball move. If somebody is posting you up, you pull the chair. I just kind of pulled the chair. The rest was history.” Beckham slipped inside Carr, who grabbed the front of the receiver’s jersey and was immediately flagged. Beckham then elevated, reached his right arm well behind his head and secured the ball with three fingers before tumbling into the end zone. “You can’t see where the ball is, and to still get your hands and fingers on it and somehow be strong enough in your fingers to hold onto that thing and pull it in while falling backward?” Manning said. “It doesn’t quite make sense. One of the all-time great catches.” In three decades as a broadcaster, Collinsworth remembers two instances where he had to pause because he was stunned by what he witnessed. There was the interception by New England Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler at the goal line in the final seconds of Super Bowl XLIX, and there was the Beckham catch. When he spoke about the latter, he told the television audience, “That may be the greatest catch I’ve ever seen in my life.” Advertisement To which Michaels replied, “It’s in the conversation.” “It was just special,” Collinsworth told The Athletic. “There’s some things that the more you slow it down, the better it gets. I thought that was one of those. It was like, ‘Oh, he did that?’ And then he got his feet in and he only got three fingers on it. It just kept adding up. It’s great to have those moments. “When I was a kid, I can remember things that inspired me to want to play football or sports in general. I’m glad it happened. I’m glad there are Odell Beckhams in the world who can do things that other mere mortals can’t.” McAdoo still recalls the look of astonishment on the face of the normally stoic Manning as he came to the sideline with the crowd buzzing after the catch. It never subsided throughout a game Dallas won 31-28. “It was electric,” McAdoo said. “I’ve been a part of some big games, whether it was the Super Bowl, whether it was Aaron (Rodgers) and Brett (Favre) playing for the first time in the Metrodome. The buzz in the stadium after that happened lasted the whole game. It’s going to be hard to beat that catch.” In many ways, the catch was buoyed by the perfect storm. It was a prime-time Sunday game, and NBC had a multitude of camera angles to do it justice. The game featured two big market teams with deep fan bases. Beckham’s catch generated oohs and aahs from the crowd as it was shown across the stadium. The gasps kept coming as fans turned to their phones to keep watching clips of the reception. “We’ve never had a play, I think in sports history, that went as viral,” said former Giants guard Geoff Schwartz, one of the first players to greet Beckham in the end zone. “That was sort of the start of social media being such an important part of our lives. Odell went from a first-round pick to a celebrity overnight.” Said McClain: “That was one of those defining moments where it was like, ‘OK, world, welcome your new star.'” Baltimore Ravens top receiver Zay Flowers was 14 when Beckham made the grab. Growing up in South Florida, Flowers saw a replay of the catch on his phone and went around showing his friends the highlight. “I thought it was fake,” Flowers said. “I remember watching it over and over for like two weeks straight.” Flowers and Beckham were teammates last year in Baltimore, and Flowers said the play briefly came up in conversation. When it did, Beckham told his teammate that the catch “changed his life.” Zay Flowers' locker is right next to Odell Beckham Jr.'s in the Ravens locker room. 😈 pic.twitter.com/9DeM8OvQBi — Ryan Mink (@ryanmink) September 7, 2023  Beckham immediately achieved almost mythical status in New York, his every move garnering attention and headlines. “It was like Bon Jovi coming back to the Meadowlands,” McAdoo said. “There was always a vibe about him and he was a performer.” For Beckham, the true impact of his catch resonated when he’d see young athletes practicing one-handed grabs at schools and at football camps. He has traveled extensively overseas and been asked about the catch in Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands. Advertisement He’s flattered that it has inspired others, and he understands that his immense popularity around the globe — his 17.5 million Instagram followers were the most of any NFL player as of earlier this year — traces back to that November 2014 night, when he corralled a ball that seemed destined for out of bounds. “In the most humble way, I can go almost anywhere in the world and people, for the most part, kind of remember that moment,” Beckham said. “Even people who don’t know football know me, which is a blessing. But, it’s honestly something that I never really foresaw. It came with that moment.” Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

He has the one-handed catch against the Cowboys. “People want to amount my entire career to just one catch, but there’s so many other plays that happened and things that I did, where it’s just hard to be like, ‘Yeah, he only had one catch,'” Beckham said. “I’ve caught the ball multiple times with one hand. Everything in life is about timing, and it was pretty crazy timing. ‘Sunday Night Football.’ New York Giants, Dallas Cowboys. It’s something that I’d never trade for the world. “Here I am today. It’s taught me the hardships, the good times, all of those things.” (Illustration: Dan Goldfarb / The Athletic; photos: Al Bello / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,"We Have a Worry for Every N.B.A. Team, Except One",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937616/2024/11/22/nba-early-concerns-lakers-warriors-celtics-cavs/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:01:59 +0000","After starting the season 15-0, the Cavaliers don’t have any glaring concerns, a columnist for The Athletic writes.","NBA We’re about a month into the NBA season, and while the injury bug has bitten nearly every team in one way or another, there are other worries that are worth … well, worrying about. The Athletic asked its NBA staff for each team’s biggest concern at this point. The responses covered the full spectrum, from free-throw shooting and poor depth to well-known names not yet producing at the levels we’ve come to expect in recent years. (Stats and records are through Wednesday’s games.) Advertisement Rim protection: This is a fresh concern. It might be a short-term one since the Celtics ranked near the league leaders in rim protection last season and should soon welcome back 7-foot-2 shot blocker Kristaps Porziņģis. But Boston has been gashed for layups and dunks recently, especially in a loss to the Atlanta Hawks and an all-too-close win against the Toronto Raptors. Joe Mazzulla said his team needs to improve its individual defense and rebounding. The Celtics might just be suffering symptoms of a mild championship hangover. — Jay King Nic Claxton’s back issue: The Nets got off to a surprisingly solid start, even as Claxton slowly worked his way into the rotation after a preseason hamstring injury. But now he is out again with a lingering back strain. The team wants to build an identity while the front office ideally wants to get the top pick in the draft. They’re achieving both at the moment, and there is a lot to be excited about if Cam Thomas is making a leap. But Claxton is one of the Nets’ cornerstones, and they need him to stay healthy and keep improving if this rebuild is going anywhere down the road. — Jared Weiss Lack of free throws: I could go with the defense here, but I think that’ll improve with more time and the eventual return of Mitchell Robinson. The Knicks rank 29th in the NBA in free-throw attempts per game (19.1). For a team that shoots a lot of 2-pointers — efficiently, I should add — and has a head coach who emphasizes shooting 3s, getting to the rim and free-throw attempts, it’s a bit concerning New York doesn’t visit the charity stripe more. Mikal Bridges has only taken 11 free throws this season, despite the majority of his shot attempts coming from inside the arc. — James L. Edwards III Can they get healthy and on the same page?: The Sixers are stuck in a spiral that seems inescapable at the moment. Joel Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey shared the floor together for the first time Wednesday, a game that George left early because of an injury to the same knee he hurt in the preseason. Their only two wins came in overtime, so they are a few bounces away from being completely winless. They’re already at the team meeting stage of the season. The supporting cast has struggled to shoot and rebound. There simply has not been the spark to overcome adversity that defines a season. — Jared Weiss GO DEEPER 'Feels like negativity keeps following me': Joel Embiid on Sixers' team meeting, criticisms No chance to build chemistry: RJ Barrett had an AC joint injury. Pelvic and elbow injuries have kept Immanuel Quickley to two and a half games. Scottie Barnes suffered an orbital bone fracture early in the second week of the season. The Raptors schedule was always going to be tough to start the year. However, the presumptive starting lineup, which also features Jakob Poeltl and emerging sophomore Gradey Dick, has played zero minutes. Even if you are rebuilding, you want your core pieces to get big minutes against good teams. The Raptors are missing out on that opportunity. — Eric Koreen  Team defense: After trading Alex Caruso this offseason, the Bulls knew their defense would suffer, but Chicago is on the cusp of ranking among the bottom-three teams in defense. Without a single elite defender, and absent appropriate size, Chicago knows its fortunes will be difficult to change. The Bulls are attempting to overcome their defensive limitations by playing faster and launching more 3-pointers. But they’ve compounded their issues with turnovers and cold shooting nights. — Darnell Mayberry Advertisement How about … none?: Seriously, they deserve this moment. Only a few teams have done what the Cavs did — win their first 15 games — and historically speaking, those teams wound up in the NBA Finals. It’s OK to say this team has no glaring concerns. Take a bow. If you insist, there are some issues to keep an eye on, like wing depth (the Cavs have a bunch of them, but will they hold up in the playoffs?), defensive rebounding and serviceable bigs off the bench. We just can’t, with a straight face, call any of these items concerns right now. — Joe Vardon Turnovers: The Pistons entered Thursday tied with the Bulls for 20th in the NBA in turnovers per game. Cade Cunningham is Detroit’s primary ballhandler and fourth in the league in assists per game, but he leads the NBA in total turnovers. Turnovers are to be expected with a team this young, but Cunningham is the head of the snake. Once he and the Pistons value the basketball on each possession, there should be fewer close games that keep Detroit fans on the edge of their seats. — Hunter Patterson Tyrese Haliburton: My guy can’t shoot right now. Haliburton is making just 37.5 percent of his shots overall and is chucking it at an abysmal 28.4 percent from 3-point range. These are both, easily, career lows, and for what it’s worth, his 82 percent shooting at the foul line also is a career worst. The Pacers have better players and more depth, and Haliburton’s ability to push the pace and find the open man are still paramount (his assists are down too). But for the Pacers to be good, he has to play at his usual All-Star level. — Joe Vardon Khris Middleton’s health: During training camp, Middleton told The Athletic that he needed to play in at least 70 games to consider this a successful season for himself. The Bucks are 15 games through their schedule and he has still not felt confident enough to get on the floor for five-on-five activities. The Bucks have rebounded well from their 2-8 start by winning four of their past five games, but it will be difficult to compete for a championship without a healthy Middleton. — Eric Nehm Trae Young: You can nitpick about Atlanta’s defense or the shooting on the wings or the backup point guard situation, but none of that matters if Young isn’t playing at an All-Star level. And while he’s leading the league in assists, he’s also struggled mightily to score, shooting just 38 percent on the season and failing to get off a shot in two last-shot situations that both ended in Hawks losses. While Young historically has been a slow starter, his Achilles tendinitis to begin the season adds to the concern level this time around. — John Hollinger Advertisement When will Mark Williams play again?: The Hornets are reaching an anniversary they don’t want: Dec. 8 will mark a year since Williams last played in a game. The 15th pick in the 2022 draft has played in just 62 games in his career. He missed most of last season with a back injury. This year, it’s been a left foot issue. Williams has been productive when he has played and could be a key piece for Charlotte in its rebuild, but the Hornets need to see him back on the floor to know that. — Mike Vorkunov Terry Rozier’s start: After their failed pursuit of Damian Lillard in the summer of 2023, Miami’s big move to bolster its backcourt was trading Kyle Lowry and a lottery-protected 2027 first-round pick to Charlotte for Terry Rozier. The 30-year-old got off to a decent start after his arrival in South Beach, but he missed the 2024 playoffs due to a neck injury, and he’s off to a rough start this season as the Heat have stumbled to a 6-7 mark. Rozier’s averaging 12.9 points and 3.7 assists on 38 percent shooting. Miami needs to be more explosive on offense to compete with teams such as Boston and Cleveland at the top of the Eastern Conference. Rozier has to play a key role in the offense taking another step. — Will Guillory 3-point shooting: Orlando has done an admirable job overcoming the absence of injured star Paolo Banchero. But the team still struggles to score in the half court and struggles to hit long-range shots. The Magic rank last in 3-point shooting percentage, making only 30.5 percent of their attempts. They remain competitive because of their outstanding defense, coaching, cohesiveness and home-court advantage. They have a lot of positives going for them. But as their shooting woes in last year’s playoffs demonstrated, their inability to convert from beyond the arc is an Achilles heel. — Josh Robbins Can they keep players engaged?: Still early in their rebuild, the Wizards need to finish at or near the bottom of the NBA standings to enhance their 2025 draft lottery chances. It sounds ghoulish to say, but they’re on the right track with a 2-11 record. That said, for any team, losing a lot of games (and by wide margins too) can cause collateral damage, especially to veteran players who grow impatient with losing and potentially with young players who could fall into bad habits. Can coach Brian Keefe and the team leaders keep Washington’s older players positive and the young players on the right developmental track? — Josh Robbins Same song: The Nuggets are going to win 50 games and be relevant come playoff time. But can they get over the hump this season? Do they have the quality depth to survive when all-everything Nikola Jokić is not on the floor? That’s what terminated their playoff run last season. Can it be different this time around? — Tony Jones GO DEEPER Without Nikola Jokić, the Nuggets have looked alarmingly helpless Defense: The Timberwolves had the best defense in the NBA by a country mile last season, riding it all the way to the Western Conference finals. Rudy Gobert was Defensive Player of the Year and flanked by a trio of the best perimeter defenders in the league in Jaden McDaniels, Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Anthony Edwards. Of those four players, only Alexander-Walker has resembled what he was last season. Gobert has said he isn’t playing up to his standards at the rim, McDaniels hasn’t been anywhere close to the disrupter on the perimeter and Edwards has often looked inattentive and unfocused on that end. If the Wolves are going to overcome a sluggish start, those three guys have to get their defensive teeth back. — Jon Krawczynski Alex Caruso’s shooting: Caruso scored a season-high 17 points during the recent win over the Trail Blazers. The Thunder are hoping that trend continues. For all the talk of the Caruso-for-Josh Giddey swap in Oklahoma City, neither side is seeing dividends yet. Giddey has struggled leading the Bulls offense and Caruso can’t find the net from beyond the 3-point arc, shooting just 21 percent from deep. And worse, defenders are straying all the way off him when he lines the perimeter. Caruso made more than 40 percent of his 3s in Chicago a season ago. If he continues to miss at this rate, he could become ill-fitting on a roster with shooting everywhere. But if he begins to look like himself again, at a bare minimum hitting open jumpers, the Thunder are in a better place. — Fred Katz Deni Avdija’s shot: The Blazers big offseason acquisition is off to a flat shooting start, which played a part in him losing his starting job 10 games into the season. After making a career-best 37.4 percent of his 3-pointers last season in Washington, Avdija has made only 13 of 50 in Portland (26 percent). With Shaedon Sharpe flourishing now that he is back from injury, Avdija’s minutes also have dipped slightly. He has provided value with his smarts, defense and passing, but when the Blazers gave up two first-round picks, two second-round picks and Malcolm Brogdon, they thought they were also getting a shooter on the rise. And maybe that is coming: Avdija in the last four games has made nearly half (7 of 15) of his 3-pointers. — Jason Quick Advertisement Will Hardy: The Jazz coach is so good at his job that, somehow, he still has a zombie roster competitive enough to only have the fourth-worst record in the league. It bodes well for when the Jazz have enough talent to win that Hardy will maximize that talent. He’s a phenomenal coach. But right now, the Utah front office needs about three more losses than the Jazz currently have. — Tony Jones Crunchtime conundrum: Who knew having too many closers could be this clunky? While the Luka Dončić-Kyrie Irving-Klay Thompson trio has mostly worked well, it’s still quite surprising to see these Mavs drop so many close games with all these elite shot-makers on the payroll. Six of their seven losses have been by seven points or fewer, including a stretch of four in a row (against Phoenix, Denver, Golden State and Utah) in which they lost by a combined eight points. While that’s counterintuitive, to be sure, it’s also a reminder there’s only one ball and their late-game chemistry will have to come over time. That process will be slowed a bit with Dončić sidelined for at least a week due to a wrist injury. The numbers, however, indicate Dallas has been better than its record. — Sam Amick Murky offensive identity: There aren’t many concerns with an 11-5 Rockets team within striking distance of first place in the West, but Houston’s lack of an offensive hierarchy is puzzling. The Rockets want to control the glass, run the floor in transition and defend aggressively without fouling, but the absence of a true pecking order rears its head at the wrong times, especially in crunchtime. Four of their five losses have come in the clutch when their pace and ball movement grinds to a halt. It’s hard to be a pace-and-space unit when you’re 15th in pace and 27th in 3s made per game, and those issues could be fixed with an outlined structure. — Kelly Iko Health: The Grizzlies’ depth has vastly improved from a year ago, enabling Memphis to survive — and even thrive at times — without a full complement of players. That said, the core trio of Ja Morant, Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr. has played exactly one game together, with Morant’s most recent hip injury again raising the question of just how often the Grizzlies can unite their three stars. Morant only played nine games a year ago and just eight so far this year, while Bane has played 58 and 42 the past two campaigns and only seven so far this season. — John Hollinger Is it too late to make noise?: The Pelicans are going through an unprecedented stretch of bad injury luck that’s left the roster decimated the past few weeks. After starting the season 2-0, New Orleans only has two wins in its last 14 games. There will be a few key pieces getting back on the court in the next two weeks. There’s a good chance CJ McCollum, Jordan Hawkins and Herb Jones will all be back in the lineup before the end of November. The Pelicans may start turning things around very soon. But the West is so incredibly deep that it might not matter. This is the wrong season to be playing catch-up. — Will Guillory GO DEEPER Pelicans coach Willie Green faces crossroads as injured stars near their return Lack of ball penetration: Nearly half of Victor Wembanyama’s shots are coming from the perimeter, up from just 30 percent as a rookie. The Spurs hoist the ninth-most 3s in the league, but to improve on their 20th-ranked offense, they’ll need to diversify their approach. Some of it is circumstantial: Rookie Stephon Castle, a physical downhill threat, is still learning; Tre Jones and Devin Vassell, San Antonio’s most frequent drivers last season, have only recently returned from injury; and Jeremy Sochan, who was fourth, has been sidelined since early November. Maybe reserve Keldon Johnson, who leads the way with 6.6 drives per game, gets more minutes, but it starts and ends with Wembanyama. The Frenchman needs to set the tone. — Kelly Iko Free-throw shooting: The last time an NBA team shot below 70 percent from the line for a season was five seasons ago when the Knicks did it. The last time a team with a winning record did it was nine seasons ago, when the Pistons did it. The 11-3 Warriors have made only 69.5 percent of their free throws. Andrew Wiggins, Jonathan Kuminga, Draymond Green, Trayce Jackson-Davis, Brandin Podziemski and Kevon Looney are all struggling from the line to varying degrees. They went 9 of 19 collectively in a three-point loss to the Clippers recently. In a conference where the standings margins are expected to be slim, a few free-throw-related losses in the middle months could be the difference between several seeding slots — the third to the seventh, for example — come April. — Anthony Slater Advertisement Turnovers: One of the reasons the Clippers are hovering around .500 is because they donate possessions like a red kettle is on the floor. Only the Trail Blazers and Jazz average more turnovers per game. And it’s the wrong kind of turnovers, as opponents steal the ball from the Clippers more than any other team. The Clippers can be better than league average on offense if they take better care of the ball, especially in fourth quarters. — Law Murray Depth: The Lakers’ depth was a concern entering the season, and it has grown more problematic since training camp. Jarred Vanderbilt and Christian Wood have yet to return from offseason surgeries. Jaxson Hayes is out with an ankle injury. Anthony Davis is battling plantar fasciitis, an injury that has bothered him since last season. Gabe Vincent and Max Christie have underperformed preseason expectations. Los Angeles is winning enough to stay competitive in the West, but it’s largely been because of production from the starters and D’Angelo Russell. Longer term, the Lakers need to get healthy and/or improve their roster via trade(s). — Jovan Buha GO DEEPER Dalton Knecht is on fire — and so are the Lakers Staying healthy: Through nine games, Phoenix looked great. Then misfortune hit. Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal suffered calf strains, and a team that opened 8-1 dropped six of seven. Completely healthy, this team looked like a title contender. Durant played like an MVP candidate. Beal excelled in his role. A rebuilt bench contributed. But it’s not even Thanksgiving, and the Phoenix injury report has become a main storyline. The good news: The Suns showed what was possible. They weren’t perfect, but they had something solid from which to build. The bad: As the league’s second-oldest team at 28.26 years, per NBA.com, the health factor may not go away. — Doug Haller Star workload: De’Aaron Fox is averaging 37.4 minutes per game. Keegan Murray is at 36.7. Domantas Sabonis and DeMar DeRozan are both at 36.5. That gives the Kings’ four out of the NBA’s top 14 players in minutes per game. That’s a ton to ask over the course of an 82-game marathon, especially with Sabonis (in his ninth season) and DeRozan (in his 17th season) already missing time due to back injuries. But that’s the trouble for the Kings, who have injured bench players (Malik Monk, rookie Devin Carter), questionable depth and a voracious hunger from Mike Brown and the organization to wrestle away every possible regular-season win to avoid the Play-In Tournament. Fox, Murray, Sabonis and DeRozan have been very durable players historically. That will be tested. — Anthony Slater Sign up to get The Bounce, the essential NBA newsletter from Zach Harper and The Athletic staff, delivered free to your inbox.

NYT > Sports,Shedeur Sanders Is Much More Than Colorado’s Star Quarterback,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938065/2024/11/22/colorado-football-shedeur-sanders-deion/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:01:59 +0000",The Buffaloes needed to improve after last season. So Sanders hit the recruiting trail.,"NCAAF BOULDER, Colo. — Terrell Timmons Jr. was, like so many now, sold on the grandiose vision. The transfer wide receiver was convinced Colorado would make a stunning charge toward a conference title not just because of the Buffs’ famous coach — but powered by his new quarterback, Shedeur Sanders. Sanders had a direct hand in swaying many key players to take the risk. Advertisement “Two is going to take us there,” Timmons said before the start of the season. A guarantee that, at the time, could’ve seemed a smidge idealistic. But three months on, Colorado is not hard to find at 8-2, ranked No. 16 in the College Football Playoff rankings and in control of its own destiny in the shortening race toward a Big 12 Championship Game appearance. A Colorado win over Kansas on Saturday inside Arrowhead Stadium combined with No. 16 BYU beating No. 21 Arizona State on the road and Utah beating No. 22 Iowa State at home Saturday would clinch the Buffaloes a shot at the conference crown. They can also get there by winning out, including against Oklahoma State on Black Friday.  Yes, the Buffaloes are headlined by their effervescent head coach, Deion Sanders, the Heisman Trophy front-runner in two-way rarity Travis Hunter — and their quarterback. Shedeur Sanders is a pretentious lightning rod to some, a celebrity athlete with a celebrity father to others, and is in contention to be the first quarterback selected in next year’s NFL Draft. He has thrown for 3,222 yards and 27 touchdowns and seven interceptions through the first 10 games and is completing 72.9 percent of his passes, tied for second place in the FBS with Ohio State’s Will Howard. GO DEEPER If Shedeur Sanders wants to be drafted No. 1, he needs to act like it But to get to where they are now, the Buffaloes needed much more. Shedeur, teammates say, knew it, which is why he went to work. Beyond the endless reels of social media interview clips, beyond being one of the most efficient quarterbacks in college football for a second consecutive season, perhaps Shedeur Sanders’ most impressive feat was his role in aiding in building this Buffs roster. His stardom helped lure a likely successor, too. On Thursday, Colorado landed a commitment from five-star quarterback Julian “JuJu” Lewis, a former USC commit. During Lewis’ first visit this summer to Boulder, he posed in a Colorado uniform on a gold throne as Shedeur handed him a set of keys, signifying what he would be inheriting. Advertisement Deion Sanders made no bones about flipping rosters if something isn’t up to snuff. He’s cleaned house at a historic rate. And after a humbling 4-8 season in 2023, Colorado had no choice but to beef up its offensive line and add to an already talented wide receivers group that featured Hunter, Jimmy Horn Jr. and Omarion Miller. Shedeur Sanders went recruiting, too. Timmons said Shedeur reached out on social media to gauge interest after Timmons entered the portal from NC State last December. “I would say 2’s approach is a very pro-mindset,” Timmons said when asked to describe working with him now on a day-to-day basis. “He’s very detailed with everything he does in the film room, on the field, off the field, everything. He’s very intelligent. You can tell he really looks up to Tom Brady with just the way he moves and operates.” When former Ohio State running back Dallan Hayden was in Boulder on his official visit after entering the portal in April, Hayden said Shedeur wanted to sit down with him and explain what this year’s offense would need. In January, Shedeur came across tape of former FAU wide receiver LaJohntay Wester, who had entered the portal a few weeks earlier. “I pulled up his film, and I was recruiting him myself,” Shedeur said in April. “I pulled it up myself and was like, ‘Nah, we need this guy. This is the guy we want, this is the guy we need on the field.’” Like his dad, Shedeur sold Wester on the vision of what it could look like if it all came together in Boulder. In his first year with the Buffaloes, Wester has nine total touchdowns and has been one of most dynamic receivers in the conference. In last week’s 49-24 win over Utah, Wester had a 76-yard punt return for a touchdown. “He’s just a complete quarterback,” Wester said of Shedeur last month. “I’m glad to be on his side.” Another new wideout, former Vanderbilt transfer Will Sheppard, caught two touchdowns against Utah. At 6-foot-3, Sheppard is Shedeur’s most physically imposing receiver, an ideal complement to the all-around skill of Hunter and the speed of Wester and Horn. While the receiving corps was boosted in the offseason, Hunter remains Shedeur’s go-to option. Hunter leads the team with 74 receptions, 911 yards receiving and nine receiving touchdowns. Advertisement The pair spoke of the chemistry they’ve developed earlier this month on Shedeur’s podcast “2Legendary.” “You’ve just got to have that brotherly bond, even outside of football,” Hunter said. “If you trust me outside of football, of course you’re going to trust me on the field.” For this pass-happy offense to reach its apex, more trust was needed elsewhere, too. As stellar as the second year in Boulder has been for Shedeur, the first was equally maddening. Despite being one of the most efficient quarterbacks in the country and having a 27-to-4 touchdown-to-interception ratio, he was also the most sacked quarterback in college football. He was sacked 52 times in 11 starts. Shedeur called former Indiana right tackle Kahlil Benson after he went into the transfer portal last November to introduce himself. That same day, former UTEP guard Justin Mayers went into the transfer portal, and he had five missed calls from the same number. The guy who kept trying him? His future quarterback. A few months after he signed at Colorado, Mayers posted a video on his own YouTube channel of Colorado’s offensive linemen snowmobiling in the mountains above Breckenridge, Colo., with Shedeur. One of those linemen was former five-star left tackle Jordan Seaton, who jokingly jumped out of his blocking stance shin-deep in snow with Shedeur laughing nearby. Shedeur, Seaton has said in various interviews, was one of the main reasons he chose the Buffaloes. As the race for Seaton’s signature heated up last December with other high-profile programs vying for his talent, Shedeur FaceTimed Seaton showing off his pricey diamond necklace and said, “We can shine together.” Seaton was a mandatory blindside addition for the Buffaloes to try to keep Sanders upright. Still, the Buffaloes rank 94th in allowed pressure rate in 2024 (33.6 percent), only slightly better than last year’s brutal year in which they were 110th (36.7 percent). Shedeur and the line also have allowed 31 sacks through 10 games, which is 17 fewer sacks than this point a year ago. Advertisement Seaton said Shedeur’s desire to dissect defenses from the pocket and not overreacting to mistakes has helped his learning curve as a true freshman left tackle. “Having a calm quarterback makes me more calm,” Seaton said last month. “It’s like Mike and Ike with me and Shedeur.” Clint Trickett knows the range of Shedeur’s magnetism. Now Georgia Southern’s pass-game coordinator, Trickett recruited Shedeur while an assistant at Florida Atlantic four years ago. Before Shedeur joined his dad when Sanders took the Jackson State job in September 2020, Shedeur had committed to FAU. “You want to have a quarterback who is your lead recruiter and who is that driving force, but at the same time, to have one that makes people want to come play with him, that’s not common,” Trickett said. “Most quarterbacks are all about going and getting it, but most don’t have the star power to bring them in the boat. That’s what makes him special.” Colorado’s ambitious plan is working. Yet Shedeur’s approach to leadership has been called into question by some. After Colorado was smoked by Nebraska in Week 2, his postgame comments about being sacked five times in comparison to none taken by Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola appeared to some like he was pointing blame at his own offensive line. In September, The Athletic’s Jim Trotter spoke to two former NFL general managers about how Shedeur’s personality and leadership style may impact how he’s viewed throughout the rigorous draft process. “The stuff about the comments and things like that, people will worry about that a little bit, but the work ethic is the thing,” one former GM said. On the first play of the game against Utah last week, Shedeur telegraphed a pass that was intercepted. He responded by going 30 of 40 for 340 yards, three touchdowns and completed 73 percent of his passes. Critical of himself afterward, Shedeur said he needed to “take over a little bit more” and was going to apologize to the rest of the offense. Advertisement “I can’t put the team in that type of situation,” he said. “I’m thankful for the defense. I may need to take them out to dinner this week for saving me and saving the team.” His father has routinely said that if Shedeur is given adequate protection from his offensive line, he is good enough to win games with his talent. Deion recently said he will “privately” have a hand in which teams draft Shedeur and Hunter, speaking specifically to Shedeur on FS1’s “Speak” sports show, he wants an organization “that can handle the quarterback he is.” The duo strolls the sidelines together before every game as Deion bestows advice on his son. “Show them who you are,” he said before the win over Utah. Shedeur has been known to clap back at those who speak disparagingly of the Buffaloes or flaunt any number of his ritzy possessions — diamond-encrusted watches, cars, you name it — in the general direction of detractors. Teammates say they don’t see that side of him as being a true representation of who he is. They chose to listen to what Shedeur Sanders was pitching because it’s playing out just the way he said it could. Or, in the parlance of his father, the way it always would. “You know, he’s all on social media and famous, but he’s really a normal person,” Timmons said. “He’s not Hollywood. He’s a normal person like me and you. He’s just really good at what he does.”  (Top photo: Dustin Bradford / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here Getty Images Mercedes’ Friday pace (although it was Thursday night here) shines through once again in FP2.  Lewis Hamilton ends the day fastest, which is a good sign after his recent struggles. I’m still uncertain the team has the pace to best Ferrari and McLaren, which are definitely in the ballpark at the front. Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez didn’t go for a soft tire run in FP2, meaning it’s hard to say where Red Bull stacks up in the competitive picture. But watching Verstappen’s onboard, he really didn’t seem comfortable with the balance of the car.  The Austin upgrade was intended to help improve the connection he felt between the car and the road and while there has been progress, Thursday wasn’t the most ringing endorsement of a step forward. For F1, there’ll be positivity FP1 and FP2 went by without a hitch. I am curious about the lack of fans in the main grandstand, though.  Yes it’s cold out, but I’d expect to have seen more today. Let’s see if it picks up through the rest of the weekend. Advertisement Getty Images I’ve seen this one before. Mercedes finishes FP1 fastest, sparking excitement along the lines of ‘we’re so back!’ — Mercedes then fails to get any faster through the rest of the weekend, sliding behind McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull for pace. It could be a similar script in Las Vegas.  Lewis Hamilton put in a rapid final lap at the end of FP1 to finish nearly 0.4s clear of teammate George Russell in P2, with Lando Norris nearly a second off Hamilton’s time in third.  Yes, the run plans are clearly different, making it hard to glean too much from that performance. Still, Mercedes will be pleased with that start. The team has fared a little better in cooler conditions this year, meaning the cold of Las Vegas might help.  But I’d still be surprised if it had the outright pace to finish ahead of both McLaren and Ferrari. I commented to my colleagues to think back to 12 months ago, and how different things were. We were genuinely questioning if the rest of the race weekend would happen after the loose water valve cover caused FP1 to be canceled just eight minutes in.  Everything turned out good in the end, but boy was that a torrid opening night.

Plus, the Las Vegas GP beckons The Athletic  While the drivers’ title looks like just a matter of time before its inevitable victor is crowned, things feel much more up in the air with the constructors’ championship. McLaren already had the lead heading into São Paulo and didn’t lose so much ground on Red Bull, mostly owing to another poor showing from Sergio Perez. Their 36-point lead over Ferrari is a decent platform, but even Red Bull in third will hope for a turnaround in fortunes that could yet see them come out on top for a third successive season.  Alpine sit P6 but Haas and RB will have a pretty clear target for their remaining races: pinch the place off them. GO FURTHER F1 driver, constructor standings 2024: Max Verstappen on verge of another title Getty Images The prospect of Max Verstappen clinching his fourth world championship at the Las Vegas Grand Prix — F1’s glitziest race — is exciting for the sport. Verstappen will secure the title with two rounds to spare if he can finish ahead of Lando Norris on Saturday night, or if Norris fails to outscore him by three points. Preparations are already being made by officials, and yesterday I spoke with F1 chief commercial officer, Emily Prazer: 💬 “I work really closely with the Red Bull team across the board…so we called them (and) said, let’s have a chat about what this looks like if you win. We’re in Vegas, so we want to help you put on a huge party. “There’s mixed thoughts on that from their camp but we have a significant plan, as you’d expect. I don’t want to ruin it though. Just watch out for the Bellagio fountains.” GO FURTHER How Max Verstappen can win the drivers’ championship in Las Vegas and light up F1’s glitziest race Getty Images It’s been a real breakthrough year for Lando Norris, taking his McLaren into a serious title challenge and ensuring Max Verstappen has had things far from his own way over the second half of the season. But following events in Brazil, even the Brit has accepted it’s just a matter of time before Verstappen completes a fourth successive title triumph. Here is Norris, speaking from Las Vegas ahead of the track action:  💬 “I kind of know the position I’m in now, and probably I have less to lose. Post-Brazil was a tough one for me because it was the first moment realistically when I’m like, it’s tough to achieve first position now. “We were on such a good run of form, little by little… (but) it was hard to get any big points on Max, because he didn’t have any bad races. “I had a tough week because things just didn’t go our way (in Brazil) and my real fight for the championship was slimmed by the biggest margin of almost the whole year.” You can read more from Norris, speaking yesterday, in the piece below from our correspondent Madeline Coleman. GO FURTHER Ahead of Las Vegas GP, Lando Norris admits his first F1 title fight will likely end in defeat Advertisement Getty Images We could have the drivers’ championship all sewn up this weekend.  But how can Max Verstappen do that? Well, the good news is Luke Smith has gone through those exact permutations. It’s all in the link below, so you know what you should be hoping to see happen (or not) over the coming days.  GO FURTHER How Max Verstappen can win the drivers’ championship in Las Vegas and light up F1’s glitziest race The Athletic  Lando Norris was starting to seriously threaten Max Verstappen’s lead — which is why the defending champion’s victory in Brazil felt like such a telling blow. The defending champion saw his buffer out front return to 62 points; now a healthy margin given a maximum of 86 points are still to play for this season.  Charles Leclerc will have a second-place finish in his sights for Ferrari, as he remains within striking distance (24pts) of Norris’ McLaren. As for P5, only two points separate George Russell and his outgoing Mercedes teammate, Lewis Hamilton. That feels like one to watch over the remaining three races. Getty Images Lining up on the starting grid for the São Paulo Grand Prix, the track damp beneath him and the air heavy with the threat of rain, Max Verstappen knew how crucial this race would be. His championship lead had been eroded to just 44 points and his key title rival, Lando Norris, was starting a long way up the road.  Then one race, one performance, turned his year from an unraveling choke into the brink of another milestone.  It was a magical afternoon for Verstappen — and here you can enjoy our F1 correspondent, Luke Smith, putting it into context. GO FURTHER In Brazil, Max Verstappen produced his greatest F1 win — and closed in on another title Getty Images If Max Verstappen goes onto win his fourth drivers’ championship in Las Vegas — putting him behind only Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton (both 7), and Juan Manuel Fangio (5) — then his efforts in the previous F1 grand prix will be bookmarked as a key moment in the season. The Dutchman started Brazil’s São Paulo Grand Prix from 17th on the grid, after a rain-affected qualifying just a few hours earlier.  From there, Verstappen produced a masterclass of driving to the conditions and finding the fastest way home. Indeed, he was in a class of one — and it showed. It wasn’t entirely all his own work though. Both George Russell and Lando Norris (or maybe this should read Mercedes and McLaren) managed to fluff promising positions to leave the door open for the lead Red Bull. And as we’ve all learned over recent seasons, if you leave a gap then Verstappen almost always takes it.  As for the rest of the podium, that was completed by a stunning race from Alpine who saw Esteban Ocon finish second and Pierre Gasly third — taking their constructors’ championship points tally from 14 to 49 in just one race.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"49ers' Brock Purdy, Nick Bosa ruled out vs. Packers; Brandon Allen to start at QB",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5941234/2024/11/22/49ers-brock-purdy-nick-bosa-out-packers/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 22:37:48 GMT","Kyle Shanahan on Brandon Allen: ""He’s done a really good job since he’s been here. Been here two years now and guys believe in him.”","NFL SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Brandon Allen, who’s had a single kneel-down snap in nearly two seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, will start Sunday’s critical game against the Green Bay Packers. Allen will make his first start for the 49ers because regular starter Brock Purdy could barely throw a ball this week after injuring his right shoulder in Sunday’s loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Advertisement Kyle Shanahan said Purdy had an MRI of the shoulder on Monday that revealed no obvious damage. The plan at that point was for him to take it easy in Wednesday’s practice — Purdy didn’t attempt any passes that day — and to ease back into his practice routine as the week went on. But when Purdy tried to throw on Thursday, the shoulder continued to bother him and he left the field early in the session. Shanahan said that until that point, the team thought Purdy would play in Green Bay. “We thought he just needed some rest and we really weren’t concerned about him not being good this week,” Shanahan said when asked if there was long-term concern. “But when he started up Thursday, it surprised him — surprised us — how it felt, so we had to shut him down. So I really don’t know what to think of it. The MRI doesn’t look (bad), so it should be all right. But the way it responded this week — it’s really up in the air for next week. We will have to see on Monday.” 49ers quarterbacks at the start of practice. Missing: Brock Purdy … pic.twitter.com/2p0k9NIIhU — Matt Barrows (@mattbarrows) November 22, 2024    Sunday’s game will be the first Purdy has missed due to injury since taking over as starter two-thirds of the way into the 2022 season. He nearly was scratched from his second career start that year after he broke a rib while diving for a first down in a win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Purdy has said he didn’t feel that injury initially. But as he cooled down over halftime, the pain and stiffness started to take over. He had a similar reaction to the shoulder injury. Shanahan said the quarterback didn’t know when it occurred but that the shoulder became more tight as the game went on. “That’s why he was warming up a lot more than usual,” he said. “He said he had a hard time keeping it loose. Then after the game is when it really started to hurt, and Monday morning is why we did an MRI for it.” Kyle Shanahan said they were surprised when Purdy had trouble throwing the ball on Thursday. ""We were fully prepared for Brock to go."" He said Purdy's shoulder started tightening up toward the end of the game and then grew more painful after the game. — Matt Barrows (@mattbarrows) November 22, 2024  Allen, meanwhile, served as Joe Burrow’s backup with the Cincinnati Bengals for three seasons before joining the 49ers last year. He entered the NFL as a sixth-round pick by the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2016 before moving on to the Los Angeles Rams (2017-18) and Denver Broncos (2019). In Cincinnati the next year, he was a popular presence in the locker room and a good, veteran sounding board for Burrow, a rookie in 2020. Advertisement The 49ers looked at Allen, 32, in a similar way — someone who would be a good resource for the inexperienced Purdy. Last year, Allen was the third quarterback behind Purdy and Sam Darnold. This year he competed with Joshua Dobbs in the spring and summer to be Purdy’s primary backup.
Dobbs seemed like the more aggressive thrower and was a decidedly more dangerous runner than Allen. He also had gaudier preseason statistics. He was 34 of 51 for 351 yards with one passing touchdown, one rushing touchdown and an interception while Allen was 19 of 30 for 194 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. The 49ers, however, preferred Allen’s command of the offense and have tapped him as their No. 2 in every game so far. Allen has played under Rams coach Sean McVay, former Broncos coordinator Rich Scangerello and Bengals coach Zac Taylor, all of whom run a variation of Shanahan’s system. “I think Brandon’s a really good thrower, runs our offense well,” Shanahan said. “He’s done a really good job since he’s been here. Been here two years now and guys believe in him.” The 49ers also like that Allen’s playing style is similar to Purdy’s and that the offense doesn’t change dramatically with Allen running it. “I know Brandon. I was with him in L.A.,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur noted on Friday. “He’s played, he’s been in the league now a long time. But I wouldn’t expect their offense to change a whole bunch.” Without Purdy, the 49ers may need to lean more heavily on a running game that ranks seventh in rushing yards per game but lacked its usual pop — especially on outside runs — in the last two contests. That coincided with Christian McCaffrey’s return to the lineup after a two-month absence due to Achilles tendonitis. McCaffrey also didn’t practice much in the offseason or in training camp and has acknowledged that he’s still getting back in the groove. His longest run in Week 10 was 13 yards. Against the Seahawks on Sunday, he had a long of 11 yards. Advertisement The rushing attack ought to be helped by George Kittle’s return. The team’s tight end — who’s essential on the stretch zone runs — missed Sunday’s game due to a hamstring strain but has said he’ll play in Green Bay and is not on the injury report. More tenuous is left tackle Trent Williams, who needed a pain-numbing injection to play against Seattle and who will be a game-time decision Sunday as well. Defensively, the 49ers will be without sack leader Nick Bosa, who exacerbated a hip/oblique injury against the Seahawks. Cornerback Charvarius Ward is not quite ready to play after missing the last three weeks to mourn the loss of his child while defensive tackle Kevin Givens (groin) and receiver Jacob Cowing (concussion) also will miss the game. At 5-5, the 49ers trail the 7-3 Packers — and three other teams — for the NFC’s final wild-card spot. They are one game behind the Arizona Cardinals (6-4) in the NFC West. They also have lost to each of their division opponents, putting them in a bad spot for division tiebreakers. “I mean, I think we’ve had a real good week of practice,” said Shanahan when asked about the daunting task of winning in Green Bay without Bosa and Purdy. “I know it’s disappointing,” he said. “We knew there was a chance that Nick (wouldn’t play). I think the guys were a little surprised with Brock yesterday, but we’re going to have 48 guys in uniform. I know the guys believe in themselves. I believe in them. We’re missing two good players, definitely. But we have a lot of good players. … We’re going to fight our tails off and I expect it to be a real good game.” (Photo: Thearon W.

Granted, the Raiders are last in the league in rushing, but some poor fantasy soul out there will be adding Ameer Abdullah to their roster. Advertisement Abdullah, a 10-year veteran, has 82 yards rushing on 17 carries on the season. He also has 17 receptions for 76 yards and scored on a 10-yard catch last week against the Miami Dolphins. Rookie Dylan Laube and second-year player Sincere McCormick would back Abdullah up. “I’m ready,” Abdullah said Wednesday. “I consider myself the best back on this team, like every back does, and this is my opportunity to go out there and put my best foot forward.”   Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.  Abdullah rushed for a career-high 597 yards in 2015, his rookie season with the Detroit Lions. With the Carolina Panthers in 2021, he established personal bests in receptions (35) and receiving yards (272). Abdullah’s best overall season came in 2017, when he had 552 rushing yards, 162 receiving yards and five total touchdowns for the Detroit Lions. He has long been a reliable pass-catching option out of the backfield during his time in the league with four teams — the Lions, Minnesota Vikings, Panthers and Raiders. The Raiders will also be without cornerbacks Jakorian Bennett (shoulder) and Nate Hobbs (ankle), while Jack Jones (back) is listed as questionable following a return to practice on Friday after missing sessions on Wednesday and Thursday. Center Andre James (ankle) has returned to practice this week but has seemingly lost his starting job to rookie Jackson Powers-Johnson.

Survivor Pools | Fantasy football player rankings Updated through 5:25 p.m. ET, Nov. 22 Sam Darnold, QB, Vikings (foot) — Expected to play
Darnold was limited in Wednesday’s practice due to a foot injury but is now off the injury report and is expected to play Isiah Pacheco, RB, Chiefs (ankle) — Out
Chiefs Head Coach Andy Reid ruled out Pacheco for Sunday’s game against the Panthers, giving Kareem Hunt at least one more week of solid fantasy value. Hunt has put up double-digit points in PPR leagues in all but two games this season, though he’s coming off a six-point effort in Kansas City’s Week 11 loss to the Bills. Mike Evans, WR, Buccaneers (hamstring) — Questionable
Evans returned to practice this week and was expected to return in Week 12. But he showed up on the injury report again on Friday and is now questionable. With Chris Godwin on injured reserve, Evans is only competing with TE Cade Otton to be QB Baker Mayfield’s top target. Tyreek Hill, WR, Dolphins (wrist) — Expected to play
Hill is expected to play while nursing a wrist injury that will likely ail him for the rest of the season. While Hill’s teammate Jaylen Waddle has had fantasy relevance in past seasons, he has not done well this year, scoring only 8.0 PPR points per game. Tight end Jonnu Smith, however, had 101 receiving yards on six receptions in Week 11 and finished with 28.1 PPR points, so look to him if you’re in need of a TE with so many teams on bye this week. D’Andre Swift, RB, Bears (groin) — Questionable
Swift practiced in full Friday but is questionable for Week 12. If he sits, Roschon Johnson becomes an intriguing fantasy play after getting 10 carries to Swift’s 14 in Week 11. Advertisement Keenan Allen, WR, Bears (ankle) — Questionable
Allen is questionable for Week 12 after he rolled his ankle during practice. According to Courtney Cronin of ESPN, the Bears are “hopeful” that Allen will play. If he can’t go, look for Rome Odunze and DJ Moore to see most of the receiving work. Caleb Williams played well under new offensive coordinator Thomas Brown. The rookie QB threw for 231 yards, completed 74.2 percent of his passes and did not throw an interception. Chicago receivers could see improved fantasy numbers with Brown calling plays. Jonathon Brooks, RB, Panthers (knee) — Expected to play
Panthers head coach Dave Canales said he “fully expects” Brooks to play in the Chiefs-Panthers matchup, according to Mike Kaye of The Charlotte Observer. For fantasy purposes, it will be important to monitor how many carries Brooks gets compared to Chuba Hubbard, who has been one of the few bright spots for Carolina this season. Hubbard has accumulated 942 yards from scrimmage and has been running efficiently with 5.1 yards per carry. Adam Thielen, WR, Panthers (hamstring) — Questionable
Jalen Coker, WR, Panthers (quadriceps) — Questionable
Thielen said he felt good about his early-week workout but still has to “gain some ground to feel really good about playing on Sunday,” according to Panthers’ reporter Kassidy Hill. Coker missed Friday’s practice. Xavier Legette may end up getting a lot of looks, but QB Bryce Young completed only 15 passes in Week 10 and only 16 in Week 9. Brandin Cooks, WR, Cowboys (knee) — Injured reserve
CeeDee Lamb, WR, Cowboys (back/foot) — Expected to play
With Cooper Rush under center, Cooks’ injury status is much less important to fantasy managers, but nonetheless, he was designated for return from injured reserve on Wednesday. Head coach Mike McCarthy said Cooks is getting close, according to The Athletic’s Saad Yousuf. Cooks will compete with Jalen Tolbert and maybe even new-addition Jonathan Mingo for targets, while Lamb remains the only receiver to trust on a weekly basis with Dallas playing so poorly. Jake Ferguson, TE, Cowboys (concussion) — Out
Ferguson has been ruled out for Week 12. Backup tight end Luke Schoonmaker had six receptions on 10 targets and 56 receiving yards in Week 11. If you’re desperate for a tight end with so many teams on bye this week, consider Schoonmaker and hope Rush goes 32-for-55 as he did in Week 11, rather than 13-for-23, as in Week 10. Advertisement Tyjae Spears, RB, Titans (concussion) — Out
Spears has been ruled out for the Titans matchup against Houston. While Tony Pollard stands to see a slight uptick in usage with Spears out, Tennessee’s leading rusher had only 44 rushing yards in Week 10 and 15 in Week 11. Calvin Ridley, WR, Titans (illness) — Expected to play
Ridley did not practice Wednesday due to illness but is expected to play. Nick Westbrook-Ikhine had a massive Week 11 with 117 receiving yards and a touchdown, but that came from only two receptions, which makes him a boom-or-bust option. NWI has scored over 10 PPR points in three of the past four weeks, but Ridley is the only dependable wide receiver in Tennessee with the Titans’ limited offensive production. Darius Slayton, WR, Giants (concussion) — Expected to play
Malik Nabers, WR, Giants (groin) — Questionable
Slayton practiced in full on Thursday and is expected to play. He hasn’t played since Week 9 but averaged 9.56 PPR points before then. Daniel Jones was benched for Tommy DeVito, but targets will likely be similarly dispersed. Malik Nabers is, by far, the most targeted Giants’ receiver at 11.75 targets per game, followed by Wan’Dale Robinson with 8.4 and Slayton with 5.56. Austin Seibert, K, Commanders (hip) — Questionable
Seibert was a limited participant in Thursday’s practice and is questionable for Week 12. Zane Gonzalez filled in for Seibert in Week 11 and made all three of his field goal attempts and was perfect on extra points. Zamir White, RB, Raiders (quadriceps) — Doubtful
Alexander Mattison, RB, Raiders (ankle) — Doubtful
Neither Mattison nor White practiced Thursday and are doubtful for Sunday’s afternoon game. Each of them had five carries, and while Mattison had more yards (19) than White (nine), the numbers don’t bode well for future fantasy production for either of these backs. How many ways are there to say the Raiders are just plain bad? Next up on the depth chart are Ameer Abdullah and Dylan Laube. MarShawn Lloyd, RB, Packers (appendicitis) — Out
Josh Jacobs, RB, Packers (quadriceps) — Questionable
Lloyd was reinstated from injured reserve but was placed on the non-football illness list Wednesday. Jacobs has been leading Green Bay’s backfield to the tune of 4.8 yards per carry, 838 rushing yards and 186 receiving yards this season. Even if Lloyd returns in 2024, his usage is difficult to predict given Jacobs’ success. If Jacobs cannot play in Week 12, Emanuel Wilson and Chris Brooks will likely share carries. George Kittle, TE, 49ers (hamstring) — Questionable
Kittle told reporters, “I will playing on Sunday, very excited, can’t pass up playing the Packers.” Kittle’s absence was felt in Week 11, and with the 49ers battling for a playoff bid, the situation seems right for Kittle’s return. Advertisement Brock Purdy, QB, 49ers (shoulder) — Out
Purdy was ruled out Friday ahead of the Niners big Sunday game against Green Bay. Purdy’s backup is Brandon Allen who has a career completion percentage of only 56.7 percent and hasn’t started and played a full game since 2021. It would not be surprising if RB Christian McCaffrey got the ball a lot. Like, a lot, a lot. Noah Fant, TE, Seahawks (groin) — Questionable
Fant hasn’t played since Week 8 and is questionable again heading into Week 12. Rookie AJ Barner started in Fant’s absence in Weeks 9 and 11 but totaled only 42 receiving yards on six receptions and 11 targets. Jalen Hurts, QB, Eagles (ankle) — Expected to play
Hurts was a limited participant early in the week which led to an injury report appearance, but he practiced Thursday and is expected to play. DeVonta Smith, WR, Eagles (hamstring) — Out
Smith has been ruled out for Week 12. He has struggled the past two weeks with only 10.3 PPR points in the two games combined, to go with a total of nine targets and six receptions. Outside of Smith and A.J. Brown, there are no other Philly receivers to roster, even if Smith sits. Jahan Dotson has averaged only 2.09 PPR points per game on an average of 1.7 targets. Ladd McConkey, WR, Chargers (shoulder) — Questionable
McConkey did not participate in practice on Thursday. If he can’t play, Quentin Johnston, Joshua Palmer and TE Will Dissly could see an uptick in usage. In Weeks 10 and 11 combined, Dissly led the Chargers with 12 targets; McConkey had 11, Johnston saw 10, and Palmer was targeted six times. Jake Ciely has McConkey as WR15 this week and Johnston as WR24. 
  Outdoor games only. Statistics in this section come from TruMedia.  The weather hasn’t impacted many games this season, but colder temperatures and precipitation await, as seen in Thursday night’s game. According to Rotowire, the Cardinals-Seahawks matchup on Sunday comes with an expected temperature of 49 degrees and a 63 percent chance of rain. Advertisement Arizona Cardinals (6-4) vs. Seattle Seahawks (5-5) Kyler Murray has played in two regular-season rain games, and his completion percentage for those contests is 67.9 percent, compared to a career regular-season total of 66.9 percent without rain. Don’t get too excited. Beyond the small sample, in those two games he threw for only one touchdown and averaged only 159 passing yards per game. Geno Smith’s career numbers in the rain: A completion percentage of 55.6, four touchdowns and five interceptions on 6.5 yards per attempt in five rainy games. Without rain, Smith’s numbers are vastly different. His completion percentage rises to 64.6 percent, yards per attempt to 7.2, and his TD-to-interception ratio is 1.4. Teams typically move toward run-heavy gameplans with precipitation, and Arizona has the tools to do it. James Conner leads a backfield that also includes Trey Benson and Emari Demercado (questionable). Murray, too, gets yards with his legs and has 371 of them on the season already. The Cardinals average a whopping 5.2 yards per carry (second in the league) for 1,494 team rushing yards (sixth), while the Seahawks rank 26th in opponents yards per rush (4.8). Conner may exceed expectations this week. The Seahawks haven’t fared as well this year with a backfield led by Kenneth Walker III. Walker has gained over 100 yards on the ground only once this year, averaging 56.5 rushing yards per game. His rush EPA is -2.82 (compared to Conner’s 0.29) and ranks 27th out of 28 among backs with over 100 carries. But Arizona’s run defense is certainly not intimidating, allowing 127.5 yards per game (19th) and 4.5 yards per carry (21st). Wondering what the weather impact is on fantasy production? Jake Ciely has you covered like a poncho in rainy season.
 Game-specific previews and live updates are available on the day of the game. San Francisco 49ers (5-5) vs. Green Bay Packers (7-3) The Green Bay Packers are slight home favorites in their Week 12 contest against the San Francisco 49ers. Coming off a 1-point win against the Bears — secured in the final seconds by a blocked field goal — the Packers weren’t exactly dominant against a struggling Chicago team last week. The Niners are coming off a 20-17 loss to Seattle (who had lost five of their previous six games) and are in a very tight NFC West race that has the 6-4 Cardinals on top. Jordan Love and Brock Purdy have become franchise quarterbacks over the past two seasons, however the Niners will be without Purdy Sunday. Love ranks 30th in completion percentage this season, one spot below recently released Giants QB Daniel Jones. Luckily for Love, he has a receiver ranked in the top five in passer rating when targeted (minimum of 35 touches). Jayden Reed tops the list at 146.0. Read the full preview (coming Sunday).  Philadelphia Eagles (8-2) vs. Los Angeles Rams (5-5) The Philadelphia Eagles are favored on the road against the Los Angeles Rams in this NFC matchup. The Rams are coming off a narrow 28-22 victory against New England. After a disappointing 9.7 fantasy point performance in Week 10, Matthew Stafford bounced back with 295 passing yards and four TDs against the Patriots. Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua each had over 100 yards receiving and scored (Kupp had two TDs; Nacua had one). Advertisement Led by QB Jalen Hurts, the Eagles boast two talented receivers of their own, A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. But Philadelphia has Saquon Barkley, and the Rams do not, and at 273.1 yards allowed per game, the Eagles defense is a force. In contrast, the Rams D sits at 23rd, allowing 350.6 yards per game. Week 12 presents the perfect opportunity for Smith to return to fantasy relevance after Weeks 10 and 11, when he scored 3.4 and 6.9 PPR points, respectively. Read the full preview (coming Sunday).   Baltimore Ravens (7-4) vs. Los Angeles Chargers (7-3) Coming off a tough Week 11 loss to the Steelers, the Ravens are favored by less than a field goal on the road against the Chargers in this AFC matchup that has head coaches Jim and John Harbaugh meeting for the first time since Super Bowl XLVII. The Jim Harbaugh-led Chargers have been rolling lately. Justin Herbert is throwing more and ranks sixth in passer rating (102.1), J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards are handling backfield work, and Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston lead the Chargers’ wide receivers in targets, receiving yards and yards after the catch. Lamar Jackson has had an MVP season for Baltimore (excluding last week’s poor performance), but Derrick Henry has taken a step back lately with under 80 net yards in three of his last four games. Zay Flowers continues to impress (though somewhat inconsistently), while Diontae Johnson has become a fantasy drop, averaging two targets and 0.5 receptions per game. The Chargers defense is tough, and Tuli Tuipulotu has led the NFL over the past three weeks with six sacks, but Jackson has the third-most time to throw in the league. This Harbaugh brothers matchup is full of talent and intrigue. Read the full preview (coming Monday). 
 Statistics in this section come from TruMedia.  Austin Mock scours his weekly projections to spot the top values on the board. Bet picked Thursday: Minnesota Vikings -3 (-115) at Chicago Bears Caleb Williams and this Bears offense looked a lot better last week after making a change at offensive coordinator. Unfortunately for them, the Vikings’ defense is much better than the Packers’ and defensive coordinator Brian Flores getting to face a rookie quarterback is quite the bad matchup. I do have concerns about this Vikings offense since the loss of left tackle Christian Darrisaw, but they should have enough to complement their dominant defense. Advertisement Worst price to bet: Vikings -3 (-115) — Mock See all of Mock’s best bets for Week 12. 
 A weekly guide to staying alive from Renee Miller and Adam Gretz. Odds from BetMGM as of Thursday. Question from Melissa: “Six people left. What’s the best plan for the next two weeks: Kansas City (at Carolina), then Minnesota (vs. Arizona); Miami (vs. New England), then Kansas City (vs. Las Vegas); Houston (vs. Tennessee), then Kansas City (vs. Las Vegas)? Most others left in the pool have already used Kansas City and Miami, if that matters.” Congratulations on making it this far! As tempting as it would be to pick Kansas City this week, I would skip the first option because I simply do not trust the Minnesota vs. Arizona game next week. I think the Cardinals are probably pretty legit, and even if they don’t outright beat the Vikings, I could see that being a game you have to sweat through. Plus, I think Kansas City should win the next two games, and both matchups are very favorable. There’s nothing wrong with saving the Chiefs for that game against a very bad Raiders team. Now, the question comes down to Miami or Houston this week. Honestly? I like both of them; they are my picks for the week. If you had to ask me to pick one emphatically and with the most confidence, I would go with Houston. I cannot see the Titans going on the road and beating the Texans, especially with a healthy Nico Collins back in the lineup. You could probably argue that if everybody has already used Kansas City and Miami, they might take Houston this week, so it might make sense to try countering that by taking Miami. I think they will both win anyway, but I am still going to say take the Texans because I have slightly more confidence in them being the safer pick for this week. — Gretz Get this week’s top survivor pool tips.

Smith’s designation is unsurprising given that he did not practice all week due to a hamstring injury. But the news confirms the Eagles will be without one of their top receivers yet again, with Smith and A.J. Brown now having missed multiple games. Smith will be sidelined for the second time after previously missing Week 4 with a concussion, while Brown missed three games, including Week 4, earlier this season. Friday's Injury Report#PHIvsLAR pic.twitter.com/hEyV5JAj0Q — Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) November 22, 2024  The Eagles offense was mostly inefficient in its three games without Brown and Smith. They went 1-2 while failing to score in the first quarter in each game. They relied more heavily on running back Saquon Barkley and did not have their best matchup winner available to capitalize on the passing opportunities Barkley created. Advertisement Smith’s absence has a different impact on the passing game. He’s been quarterback Jalen Hurts’ most reliable target over the middle, and his proficiency to create separation on slants and gain explosive yardage after the catch won’t be easily replaced. It’s possible receiver Britain Covey (shoulder) could help fulfill Smith’s role in Week 12. Covey’s 21-day practice window opened up earlier this week, and he was a full participant in each practice. The team listed him as questionable for Sunday’s matchup. (Photo: Luke Hales / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Kane scored all three goals in the match as Bayern beat Augsburg at home following the international break. In doing so, the England captain surpassed a record previously set by Erling Haaland when he was at Borussia Dortmund. The Norwegian scored his 50th Bundesliga goal in his 50th game in the league in November 2021, beating Timo Konietzka’s previous record by nine matches. Advertisement Kane has been in imperious form since joining Bayern from Tottenham Hotspur in the summer of 2023 and it took him only 43 games to score 50 goals in the German top flight. The 31-year-old has also registered 14 assists in those matches. Despite Kane’s 36 league goals — 44 in all competitions — last season, Bayern ended the campaign trophyless, finishing third and 18 points behind the undefeated champions Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga. This term, Bayern themselves are undefeated after 11 games with nine wins and two draws, with Friday’s win putting them eight points ahead of second-placed RB Leipzig, who play on Saturday. GO DEEPER Are Bayern Munich any good under Vincent Kompany? Analysis by German football writer Sebastian Stafford-Bloor The context for this achievement is that, for 15 months, Kane has been scoring goals at a record-breaking rate for a Bayern team that has not always functioned particularly well. Yes, they had moments of power under Thomas Tuchel and now Vincent Kompany, but nothing compared with the dominance they enjoyed in previous eras. Kane has been one of the few parts of the team that has worked consistently, scoring goals through force of will at times. He still faces criticism. The week before the October international break, he and Bayern suffered a frustrating week, drawing at home to Leverkusen, losing away to Aston Villa and then losing a stoppage time lead to draw 3-3 with Eintracht Frankfurt. Kane failed to score in all of those games and, in their aftermath, the German media came as close to rounding on him. Who cares about goals against Holstein Kiel and Bochum? That was the gist. Augsburg are not a Bundesliga big beast so, most likely, this latest treble — two penalties and a late, scruffy third — will not draw much attention on its own. But, as he did last season, Kane is scoring goals in an imperfect side, within which he is still finding a balance between dropping deep and leading the line. Has he been at most fluent? Not really, but he also leads the side in assists this year and that currency — his literal contribution — is really all that matters at Allianz Arena. Advertisement What a luxury for Kompany, too. Several parts of this Bayern side are undergoing renovation. Jamal Musiala has played sensationally well at times, but the defence remains a work in progress, the midfield is missing Aleksandar Pavlovic and Joao Palinha, and — before this season — Kingsley Coman and Serge Gnabry had both suffered plummets in form. But the steady beat of Kane’s goalscoring has helped the side develop confidence and authority this season, helping also to inspire individual improvements. Gnabry and Coman are revived. Leon Goretzka provided a beautiful assist for Kane’s hat-trick goal on Friday and cracked a smile for what seemed like the first time this season. These things matter. Has Kane been a success yet? By his own admission, not until he wins something. After all, he broke plenty of records at Spurs and that was never enough for him. But he is certainly doing his part in leading Bayern towards their broader aims and living up his side of that €100million (now $104m) deal.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Yankees’ Aaron Judge on Juan Soto pursuit: ‘He knows how we feel about him’,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5941279/2024/11/22/yankees-aaron-judge-juan-soto-free-agency/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 22:04:02 GMT",Soto finished third in AL MVP ballots after a landmark season hitting in front of Judge.,"MLB Aaron Judge said he hasn’t spoken to Juan Soto since the New York Yankees lost in the World Series in late October, but he’s come up in conversation with owner Hal Steinbrenner. “He knows how we feel about him,” Judge said. Judge, the team captain and two-time MVP, added he wouldn’t care whether the Yankees give Soto — just 26 years old — a bigger contract than the $360 million, nine-year deal he signed before the 2023 season. Advertisement “It ain’t my money,” Judge said. “I really don’t care. As long as we get the best players and the most we can, I’m happy with whatever.” Judge was speaking with members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America via conference call Friday afternoon, the day after it unanimously voted him the American League MVP. The 32-year-old put up another historic season, posting a 218 wRC+ — the highest ever recorded by a right-handed hitter in either league. Judge also clobbered an MLB-best 58 home runs and 144 RBIs while hitting .322. Judge said he preferred his 2024 campaign over the run he had when he earned his first MVP in 2022. “One thing I tried to focus on a lot going into ’24, especially when you’ve got Juan Soto hitting in front of you and he’s going to be on base a lot, it’s just capitalizing with guys on base and trying to get the RBI count as high as you can, and if you’re able to do that, we’re going to put ourselves in a good position going into the postseason,” Judge said. “I would say I liked ’24 a little better, I think.” The Unanimous MVP: @TheJudge44 👨‍⚖️ pic.twitter.com/IYK9VJnepc — New York Yankees (@Yankees) November 22, 2024  Judge said he hadn’t reached out to Soto because he wanted to give him space and that he “talked to him all season.” The Dominican Republic-born star is poised to receive perhaps the richest free-agent contract in history. The Athletic’s Tim Britton projected he could strike a deal worth $611 million over 13 seasons. Soto has already met with the Yankees, New York Mets, Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies. Formal offers could start to roll in as early as next week, a league source said. Judge added that immediately after the season ended, he spent about a week in Tampa, Fla., where the team has its player development complex. He met with Steinbrenner, offering his opinions on players the Yankees should consider pursuing. The pair also brought up Soto. Judge said he’s enjoyed becoming involved in the club’s decision-making process and consulting with Steinbrenner. ﻿ “When we first met when I was a free agent at the end of ’22, that’s one of the first things he said: ‘Hey, I want to build a relationship with you and have you be a part of this. You’re going to be here for however long your contract is going to be. You’re going to be a Yankee for life,'” Judge said. “He really opened it up to be that if I had any input and feelings about things — he’s not down in the clubhouse and on the field every single day. Advertisement “I just think having that relationship to where I can communicate with him about what I’m seeing, what I’m feeling and what I see with the guys, what I see with other guys we play against, I love it. I think it’s a cool part. I think the more communication you have from top to bottom, it just makes everybody better just being honest with each other.” Judge also discussed what it was like having Soto hitting in front of him in the lineup. Soto finished third in the MVP race, just behind shortstop Bobby Witt of the Kansas City Royals. “You look at the Dodgers lineup where you have their first three guys are MVPs,” Judge said. “You’re going through three tough at-bats back-to-back-to-back there. I think having a chance for Juan to hit in front of me, I get to see a lot of pitches. He’s going to be a tough at-bat in front of me. He’s going to wear down the pitcher right there in the first inning. I think that was a big impact, having a guy like that in front of you. “If I could have eight Juan Sotos in the lineup with me, I would love that.” As for what Judge hopes for Soto? “I think the most important thing is to now let him do his thing with his family, pray about it, talk with people and come to the right decision for him and his family,” he said.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Las Vegas F1 sights and sounds, plus: New team coming soon?",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5941239/2024/11/22/las-vegas-grand-prix-f1-prime-tire/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:52:55 GMT","Welcome to Prime Tire, The Athletic's Formula One newsletter.","Formula 1 Prime Tire Newsletter  | This is The Athletic’s twice-weekly F1 newsletter. Sign up here to receive Prime Tire directly in your inbox. Welcome back to Prime Tire, where we’re wondering if we have time for a joke in this section oh wait we don’t aw shucks. I’m Patrick, my writers are at the Las Vegas GP, we have some breaking news and let’s get to it. Late (and I mean late) last night, news broke that General Motors is edging toward securing a place on the Formula One grid with its own team as early as 2026 when the field could expand to 11 teams. The news was first reported by the Associated Press. What you need to know: It’s not a lot to go on, but you can read our story here. We detailed Andretti’s ongoing effort to join F1 a few months ago. I’m sure there will be plenty more to say about this over the next few weeks. For now, on to Las Vegas … 2023 was about taking in the race’s spectacle. We entered the 2024 race week hoping to dig deeper, report on some questions we and our readers had. Here is how we’ve fared so far: How does F1 get the Strip ready for racing? Are local businesses upset with the disruption? How does F1 book celebrities at a race like this? Can you watch the race without emptying your savings? Of course, we’re still reporting all around the track on some fun stories this weekend. Make sure to check on our page every day. Now, let’s throw it to Luke and Madeline in the paddock. Before F1 got on track on Thursday in Las Vegas, I had an entertaining time finding out about F1’s new partnership with Lego, which will see a new range of products released in early 2025. The range will cover all ages of Lego products, from Duplo sets for the youngest children to the adult specialist sets that run into thousands of pieces. But importantly, the Speed Champions range will feature all 10 cars — and, impressively, they’re actually all designed differently after close collaboration between the teams and the Lego designers working on the sets. I got a first-hand look at the products today, and you can spot the differences: the Sauber has a double rear wing pylon, and the McLaren’s sidepods are unique. Even the Red Bull has its high shoulders on the engine cover. It made me feel like a big kid, but it also pushed home just how creative F1 has become in its partnership and bits to expand its audience. If kids can get their hands on F1 cars in Lego form from age three and work their way up, it could help turn them into fans for life. Pat note: Check out The Athletic‘s holiday gift guide! After any long-form story, the writer will likely have a notebook full of unused facts and quotes that did not quite fit the theme or final story word count. I wrote an in-depth story about the history of Tommy Hilfiger and F1, which ran earlier this week, and gosh, do I have so much to tell y’all. During his partnership with Lotus, the designer realized there was a market for F1 team uniforms among fans. Advertisement “My gut instinct told me that people would think it would be cool to wear the uniforms, and it may have come from my love for sports uniforms,” Hilfiger said. “Growing up, I worked in a sporting goods shop, and I was handling a lot of the uniforms for the football teams, the basketball teams, the hockey teams, the soccer teams. And in those days, the way they made uniforms was much different. They made them out of a high level quality fabrication. The numbers were stitched on in satin. They didn’t have tech fabrics then, like we have today. “But the football uniforms, basketball uniforms, baseball uniforms were made of a different type of material than you would find in sort of normal clothing. And when I started my brand, I took that inspiration and incorporated it into what I was designing. So when we started coming out with sportier looking clothes, they were very authentically built.” We were talking last night about how different Wednesday practice felt from a year ago, when a water valve cover threw the night into disarray. (Don’t worry, that should be fixed.) Instead, the running last night was relatively … boring? No incidents. Just cars rubbering in the track. The crowd even thinned out midway through FP2. (It was past midnight.) Mercedes led both sessions, but I wouldn’t place bets based on that. We should see Ferrari, Red Bull and McLaren establishing themselves tonight for FP3 and qualifying.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Heat show Thanksgiving spirit, hope '1A and 1B' options are ready for Mavericks",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940353/2024/11/22/miami-heat-thanksgiving-erik-spoelstra-bam-adebayo-pat-riley-dallas-mavericks/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:26:47 GMT","What happens when the Heat spread Thanksgiving cheer? ""A lot of people are going to have a great holiday because of this,"" Pat Riley said.","NBA NBA teams enjoy showing appreciation to their fan bases, particularly when it’s holiday time. Few teams in sports support their communities more fervently than the Miami Heat, who hosted their 33rd annual Thanksgiving Celebration on Thursday. The team collaborated with organizations to distribute 600 Thanksgiving baskets and also give 450 hot meals to underserved families throughout Miami-Dade County. Advertisement It’s hard for NBA teams to maximize five consecutive off days, but the Heat (6-7) found some solace in giving back and honing its relationship with the fans. Miami hasn’t played since Monday and won’t suit up again until Sunday. “There actually have been a lot of tears — tears of joy, tears of gratitude,” Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra said Thursday. “This is our 33rd year doing this. … It’s turned into more than it was 33 years ago. Now, it’s a festive party. “This is our backyard here, and to share on a day like this really is amazing.” Among other Heat luminaries in attendance: three-time All-Star Bam Adebayo, team president Pat Riley and Heat stalwarts Alonzo Mourning and Bob McAdoo.

He said he enjoys such events every year and will never get tired of doing them.

The biggest thing I learned about U.D. (Udonis Haslem): He was always on the frontline when he does community work. I feel like that’s the biggest representation you can have — you being there.” At this time of the year — between the dishes, high-spirited crowds and charitable moments — what was the best moment of the entire afternoon? Advertisement Riley, who earlier this week learned the Los Angeles Lakers will honor him with a statue, reflected on how important it is for Heat culture to be an extension of the NBA community, no matter the fan base or location. “I think it’s important for any organization, any business,” Riley said. “You create an environment in which everybody can flourish, and that becomes a shared vision within the organization. That doesn’t mean that a lot of people sometimes don’t agree with it, but everybody gets on board, and that’s what the important thing is. “The NBA is a giving league. I think every franchise — from the front office right on down to the players association — has this kind of spirit in their communities. … A lot of people are going to have a great holiday because of this.” On Sunday, the Heat will host the Dallas Mavericks (8-7) in their first game since Monday’s double-digit win over the Philadelphia 76ers. The Heat have played only five home games thus far, the fewest in the NBA. They’re aiming to reach .500 again but have won three of of their last five. The biggest key to Miami’s turnaround? Since Nov. 10, the Heat are fifth in defensive rating after ranking 20th. They will seek to either maintain or improve that footing against Dallas, which will be without Luka Dončić, who is expected to miss at least the next week with a wrist injury. Dallas enters this matchup with three consecutive wins after losing a season-worst four straight. The Mavericks rank seventh in overall net rating despite being a game over .500. Last season, the Heat lost both regular-season meetings, including a 19-point loss the last time the Mavericks visited South Florida. Dončić and teammate Kyrie Irving combined for 54 points in that matchup, and the latter should be comfortable picking up the slack Sunday. Irving is second on his team in points per game (24.3) and is enjoying the most efficient season of his career (career-high 54.5 percent shooting, 53.8 percent from 3). Such potency undoubtedly will test Miami’s improved defense. Advertisement That could be an opportunity for either Jimmy Butler or Tyler Herro to carry Miami’s offense and avoid the game getting out of hand. Butler recently returned from a four-game absence with 30 points and 10 rebounds. In the two losses to Dallas last season, he averaged only 13 points. Herro is maintaining a career-high 24.2 points-per-game average, but he is shooting only 40.8 percent in his last three games. After Monday’s win, Butler jokingly called himself and Herro “1A and 1B” in terms of Miami’s scoring hierarchy. If both players catch fire on Sunday, it can help Miami reach .500 again, and the team (and its fans) could have a bit more to be grateful for as the holiday season unfolds.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman says league's organizational values will not change under Trump presidency,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940820/2024/11/22/nwsl-trump-commissioner-berman/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:11:09 GMT",Women’s soccer has been subject to President-elect Trump’s attention over the last two World Cup cycles.,"NWSL KANSAS CITY — NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said that the league would prioritize its organizational values, in response to a question from The Athletic regarding the potential impacts of the incoming Trump administration on women’s health and LGBTQ+ rights and possible immigration policy changes. Advertisement “Whether [Donald] Trump is the president or Kamala [Harris] was president, we’re committed to the values of the league, and we stand for inclusivity, excellence and unity,” she said Friday during a press conference at CPKC Stadium ahead of Saturday’s NWSL Championship between the Orlando Pride and Washington Spirit. “We’re going to continually live by our values and support everyone in our ecosystem, inclusive of our fans, our players, our employees, in every community where we operate.” President-elect Trump has pledged multiple times through this campaign to “keep men out of women’s sports,” which has been a recurring platform at all levels of the Republican party during this election cycle. However, Trump has not provided specifics on what steps he would take. “You just ban it,” he said during a Fox News town hall in October. “The president bans it. You just don’t let it happen.” There has been an increase in bills from Republicans that would limit the participation of transgender athletes in sports across the United States, but so far, they have largely targeted youth sports. The NWSL issued a policy on transgender and nonbinary athlete participation in 2021, which begins with the guiding principle of “creating a safe, non-discriminatory and inclusive environment for all of its athletes while maintaining competitive equity throughout the league.” The policy does allow challenges to an athlete’s eligibility under the policy, though the league states it “will only consider requests that are reasonable and made in good faith.” According to the league’s eligibility guidelines, any athlete assigned female at birth is eligible to play in the league, while those who are designated female at birth who are transitioning to male and are undergoing testosterone hormone therapy are ineligible to compete in the NWSL, unless their hormone levels fall under certain levels. Advertisement Athletes who transition from male to female are eligible to compete if their total testosterone level is within the typical limits of women athletes over a set period. The NWSL currently only has one out transgender player, who was assigned female at birth and who identifies as nonbinary. Berman did not offer specifics when asked about whether the league has plans to handle possible issues around immigration policy changes and how, or if, international players could be affected. Over the last two World Cup cycles, women’s soccer has been subject to Trump’s attention. While he has largely focused on the now-retired U.S. women’s national team and Reign player Megan Rapinoe in 2019 and 2023, he has also been highly critical of the U.S. women’s team. Following the USWNT’s exit from the 2023 World Cup in a penalty shoot-out with Sweden, Trump posted on Truth Social that the loss was “fully emblematic of what is happening to our once great Nation under Crooked Joe Biden.” “Many of our players were openly hostile to America — No other country behaved in such a manner, or even close,” he added. On Friday, Berman did not provide much in the way of specifics of any potential additional protections the league would put in place for players or staff, especially in the context of a player having been criticized previously. “We’re committed to ensuring that our players and our staff get all of their needs met, whether that’s healthcare, other protections around mental health — any support that anyone needs in our ecosystem,” Berman said.

A 12-person jury in the High Court in Dublin rendered the verdict after six hours of deliberation, the AP reported. The woman accused McGregor of raping her at a Dublin hotel on Dec. 9, 2018, saying the assault after a night of partying left her bruised and caused her to develop post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the AP. Advertisement McGregor denied the allegations, testifying he never forced the woman to do anything against her will. McGregor said the two engaged in consensual sex, per the AP. McGregor did not comment as he left the courtroom, but posted on X that he would be appealing the decision. I will be appealing today's decision. The judge's instruction and the modest award given was for assault, not for aggravated or exemplary damages. I am disappointed that the jury did not hear all the evidence that the DPP reviewed. I am with my family now, focused on my future.… — Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) November 22, 2024  Attorneys for both McGregor and the woman did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Athletic. The woman gave a brief statement outside the court Friday. The Athletic does not typically name victims or potential victims of sexual assault. “To all the victims of sexual assault, I hope my story is a reminder that no matter how afraid you might be, speak up, you have a voice, and keep on fighting for justice,” she said, according to BBC. “I know this has impacted not only my life, my daughter’s, my family and friends, tremendously, and it’s something that I’ll never forget for the rest of my life. But now that justice has been served, I can now try to move on and look forward to the future with my family and friends and daughter.” In court, the woman testified that McGregor put her in a chokehold and threatened to kill her during the incident, per the AP. Her lawyer said McGregor was angry about a fight he lost in Las Vegas in October 2018. McGregor said in his testimony that the woman’s story was untrue. McGregor is not facing criminal charges in the case. Police investigated, but prosecutors declined to bring charges, the AP reported. McGregor lost that 2018 bout to Khabib Nurmagomedov, who submitted McGregor with a choke. The caustic atmosphere surrounding the fight sparked a melee outside the octagon immediately after it was finished, and eventually led to suspensions for Nurmagomedov and McGregor. Since then, the 36-year-old McGregor has fought three times in UFC. His scheduled fight against Michael Chandler in June was canceled due to an injury, which McGregor said then “required more time to heal than was available to me.” McGregor, a former two-division champion, hasn’t fought since breaking his leg in the first round of a loss to Dustin Poirier in 2021. He has not won a bout since January 2020. The UFC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Photo: David Fitzgerald / Sportsfile via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Phillies non-tender Austin Hays; how they'll remake the outfield remains an unknown,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5941104/2024/11/22/phillies-austin-hays-outfield-2025/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 20:16:39 GMT",The Phillies' next outfield transactions have become important. They have been active in pursuing trades and have shopped numerous players.,"MLB As the Phillies attempt to remake their outfield, the decision not to tender Austin Hays a contract before Friday night’s deadline came with little surprise. Even if they thought he could fill a role as a lefty-mashing corner outfielder in 2025, they were not in a position to commit nearly $6 million to Hays without knowing the composition of the entire outfield. Advertisement So that closed the book on a rather forgettable summer trade by president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski, who acquired Hays for a reliever (Seranthony Domínguez) whom Baltimore deemed worthy of exercising an $8 million option for next season. Domínguez had fallen down the Phillies’ trust tree. But Hays never cracked it. A team source confirmed Hays’ departure, which was first reported by the New York Post. The Phillies envisioned Hays as an everyday player when they acquired him in late July. Numerous injuries derailed any chance of him contributing down the stretch. He went 0-for-3 with two strikeouts in the only postseason game he started. The Phillies could have aimed higher at last season’s trade deadline, although very few “impact-type” hitters were moved. They took a smaller gamble to fill a specific role. It flopped. The next outfield transactions have become important. Dombrowski resisted an external addition at the trade deadline in 2023, did not pursue an outfielder to supplement the same group between the 2023 and 2024 seasons, then failed to land a suitable platoon partner for Brandon Marsh in the summer. How they’ll remake the outfield remains a great unknown. The free-agent market, outside of Juan Soto, is not teeming with answers. The Phillies have not met with Soto’s camp, according to major-league sources. They are interested. Even if they meet and submit an offer later this offseason, they are not considered frontrunners to land him. The center field pool is barren. The Phillies might return to a Marsh platoon with Johan Rojas there. Free-agent corner mashers such as Teoscar Hernández and Anthony Santander would be power upgrades but come with high swing-and-miss rates. The Phillies have an aggressive lineup and are looking for a better balance to it. Advertisement This is why they have been more active in pursuing trades, though nothing has yet to materialize. The Phillies, according to multiple major-league sources, have made Nick Castellanos available in trade talks. They’ve shopped numerous players — namely Alec Bohm and Ranger Suárez — to gauge other clubs’ interest. All things considered, it’s not shocking they would be open to moving Castellanos. But a trade is not likely unless the Phillies eat a large chunk of the remaining $40 million on Castellanos’ contract. That would defeat one purpose of trading him elsewhere. Castellanos, for his flaws, has been available to play. He’s started 452 of a possible 486 regular-season games since joining the Phillies in 2022. That counts. The Phillies have ruled out a return to the outfield for Bryce Harper, who has found a home at first base. Their best outfield prospect, Justin Crawford, could use another year of development. The Phillies, according to major-league sources, have not excluded Crawford from trade talks. He would be moved only for a big-league player with multiple years of club control. Whenever the Phillies have faced offseason conundrums, their best solution has been to throw money at them. It might not be that simple this time. These are different challenges for Dombrowski — none more perplexing than the outfield.

We mutually agreed that would be best for him and for the team.""","NFL By Charlotte Carroll, Dan Duggan and Lauren Smith The New York Giants have released quarterback Daniel Jones, the team announced Friday. “Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him,” Giants president John Mara said in a statement. “We mutually agreed that would be best for him and for the team. Advertisement “Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way. His handling of this situation yesterday exemplifies just that. We are all disappointed in how things have worked out. We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him. We wish him nothing but the best in the future.” Brian Daboll met with #giants team and informed them of Daniel Jones release before it went public and before today’s practice “This is not an easy thing” pic.twitter.com/fmM3wcrWo7 — Charlotte Carroll (@charlottecrrll) November 22, 2024  Jones, in his sixth season with the Giants after the team drafted him No. 6 overall in 2019, was benched Monday following the Giants’ 2-8 start to the season, during which he completed 63.3 percent of his passes for 2,070 yards, eight touchdowns and seven interceptions through 10 games. GO DEEPER Giants benching QB Daniel Jones, Tommy DeVito taking over as starter The 27-year-old quarterback has played in 70 games for New York the past six seasons, throwing for 14,582 yards with 70 touchdowns and 47 interceptions and tallying a 64.1 completion percentage. Jones seemed to foreshadow his release when he spoke with reporters following Thursday’s practice. “The opportunity to play for the New York Giants was truly a dream come true. I’m extremely grateful to the Mara and Tisch families for the chance to play here,” he said. “No one wanted to win more games worse than me. I gave everything I had on the field and in preparation. Of course, this season has been disappointing for all and, of course, I wish I could have done more. I’m 100% accountable for my part. I did not play well enough, consistently enough to help the team get (good) results.” GO DEEPER Giants QB Daniel Jones addresses benching, bids farewell to fans Jones will go on waivers following his release and is unlikely to be claimed by another team with $13.8 million of guaranteed money remaining on his contract. Jones signed a four-year, $160 million extension with the Giants ahead of the 2023 season. To answer the most common questions I’m seeing:  • No impact on the Giants’ cap whether they released him now or after the season.  • Jones can sign with another team immediately after he clears waivers (he’ll clear waivers). — Dan Duggan (@DDuggan21) November 22, 2024  Players who clear waivers become free agents, and Jones could have some intriguing options once he hits the open market. He could try to sign on with a playoff-caliber team in need of a quality backup. He also could try to go to a place where he might have a chance to start again this year (Jacksonville?). Or perhaps he’ll seek out a team where he could “audition” to be the team’s quarterback in 2025 (Las Vegas?). Of course, Jones could also choose to take some time away from football before picking his next destination this offseason. Cowboys EVP Stephen Jones said on @SASportsStar that they have no interest in adding former Giants QB Daniel Jones. “No, I think we’re in good shape at our quarterback spot. We think Cooper (Rush) gives us the best chance to win right now. And certainly we still want to see… — Jon Machota (@jonmachota) November 22, 2024  The Giants, who have lost their past five games, host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 12 and will move forward with a new starter at quarterback. Giants coach Brian Daboll announced Monday, after the team’s Week 11 bye, the Giants would make a change and will start Tommy DeVito on Sunday. “After evaluating and watching a lot of tape, that’s the reason we are going with Tommy,” Daboll said. “Drew Lock will be the backup. This was a necessary move for us, and I’m looking forward to working with Tommy, and he’ll be ready to go against Tampa Bay.” Advertisement My read on Daniel Jones’ release: It’s mutually beneficial, but the Giants weren’t going to make the first move. If Jones was fine showing up every day and going through the motions as QB4, they would have gone along with that. But once he asked out, they (obviously) were going to grant that wish. — Dan Duggan, Giants beat writer GO DEEPER Is Daniel Jones now QB4 on Giants depth chart? Drew Lock 'upset' he wasn't named starter Both the Giants and Jones will get a much-needed fresh start with the QB’s release. The Giants will close out the season with DeVito and Lock, but the focus now shifts to who will be the next face of the franchise. Right now, the Giants are No. 3 in the NFL Draft, per Tankathon. For now, there are three other two-win teams. The Giants would never openly tank, but in what’s supposed to be a less top-heavy QB draft, higher draft order could be paramount in finding Jones’ successor. While New York moves on, Jones finally can, too. When asked Thursday about the possibility of being released and playing with another team before season’s end, Jones said he was still focused on the Giants. He said he was “still processing and trying to think through what the best thing is for this team and what the best thing is for me.” If Daniel Jones is not claimed, a team could sign him after 4 PM on Monday. A more realistic scenario would be signing him on Tuesday or Wednesday.  He could also wait for a QB desperate team to bring him on. — Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) November 22, 2024  But now, the reality is Jones could play elsewhere. The question is, will he decide to do that and with which team? Some of the teams floating around social media that present the most intriguing options since they’re on the Giants’ remaining schedule: the Dallas Cowboys (Dak Prescott is out for the year and backup Cooper Rush has been struggling) and the Philadelphia Eagles (final game of the year where starters could potentially sit as the Eagles go on a playoff hunt). There are obviously other potential pairings, but those two present the most Shakespearean twists. — Charlotte Carroll, Giants beat writer Advertisement There is no impact for the Giants by releasing Jones now or after the season, since they’ll have plenty of cap space in 2025. The only possible cap impacts would be if the Giants waited until post-June 1 to make a cut, as The Athletic’s Dan Duggan noted. By doing so, the team would push $11.1 million in dead money to 2026. But the Giants wouldn’t have been able to spend that money until June, meaning they couldn’t have used those extra dollars in free agency when they matters most. Instead, the full $22.2 million in dead money goes into the 2025 cap year. And both parties get a much-needed fresh start with Jones’ decision to request the release. — Carroll (Photo: Al Bello / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"ACC lawsuit against Florida State should be dismissed, 12 AGs say",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940932/2024/11/22/acc-lawsuit-florida-state-clemson-attorneys-general/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:37:26 GMT","In a brief, the attorneys general said the case should be thrown out because FSU never agreed to be sued outside of Florida.","A dozen states are asking the North Carolina Supreme Court to dismiss the ACC’s lawsuit against Florida State. In a brief dated Thursday and obtained by The Athletic, the attorneys general of those 12 states said the case should be thrown out because Florida State never agreed to be sued outside of Florida. Advertisement It’s the latest step in a months-long, nine-figure, multi-state legal battle that will help shape the future of conference realignment. It started in December, when Florida State and the ACC sued each other about the ownership of TV rights and revenue for future Seminoles home games if/when FSU leaves the ACC. Clemson and the ACC filed dueling lawsuits against each other in March. This week’s argument centers on sovereign immunity. That’s the concept that generally shields state entities (like public schools) from being sued in other states. The ACC contends Florida State and Clemson waived that right by joining and remaining in the conference, which is based in North Carolina. If the ACC is correct, its lawsuits against Florida State and Clemson can proceed in the conference’s home courts in North Carolina — courts that, so far, have made favorable rulings for the league. FSU and Clemson disagree and have appealed separate rulings to the North Carolina Supreme Court. Their home states and 10 others said FSU never gave a “clear and unequivocal” waiver to allow it to be sued outside of Florida. The same general arguments could apply to the ACC’s lawsuit against Clemson. Kentucky is the only other state with a public ACC school (Louisville) that signed on. The other nine states are: Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. If their side is correct, the lawsuits will proceed only in the home courts for Florida State (Leon County, Fla.) and Clemson (Pickens County, S.C.). Their home courts have generally ruled in the schools’ favor. In April, Florida attorney general Ashley Moody sent a letter to the attorneys general of six other states with ACC public schools asking them to consider involvement because the conference’s stance on sovereign immunity is “detrimental to all of our states.” Advertisement “If the history of college football realignment has taught us anything at this point, it is that there will be some future realignment down the road,” Moody wrote then. “The universities that have ratified such an expansive view of the waiver of sovereign immunity in the ACC Lawsuit may find that the sword that they now wield will be turned on them.” Barring a settlement, hundreds of millions of dollars hang in the balance in this ongoing litigation. If Florida State and Clemson own the media rights to their future home games, they would be able to leave for another league by paying an exit fee of only about $165 million. If the rights belong to the ACC through 2036, it will be virtually impossible for the schools to join another conference until then. FSU and Clemson are concerned about the growing media rights revenue gap between the ACC and other leagues such as the SEC and the Big Ten. In a separate filing this week, the ACC asked an appellate court to raise two procedural questions to the Florida Supreme Court as it fights the suit filed by FSU.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Predicting Notre Dame vs. Army: Can Irish keep College Football Playoff hopes on track?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940903/2024/11/22/notre-dame-army-prediction-preview-time/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:12:17 GMT",Notre Dame will try to hand undefeated Army its first loss on Saturday night at Yankee Stadium. Here's what to expect.,"NCAAF SOUTH BEND, Ind. — The advertisement only works if the Irish win. As Notre Dame readies for its 12th Shamrock Series kickoff, the regular off-site games that are as much a billboard for the university as the football program itself, Marcus Freeman understands the pressure. No. 6 Notre Dame (9-1) will face No. 19 Army (9-0) in Yankee Stadium (7 p.m., NBC) having won all 11 previous Shamrock Series games, including the past three against ranked competition. The Irish are two-touchdown favorites. And they’re just two wins away from making the first 12-team College Football Playoff, likely hosting at Notre Dame Stadium next month. Advertisement The Athletic’s projections give the Irish an 83 percent chance to make the field and a 54 percent chance of hosting a game. Notre Dame sent out CFP ticketing information to season ticket holders earlier this week. So yes, it all feels like the Irish are getting closer to the postseason horizon. What Notre Dame sees when it gets there, well, that’s down to what happens on Saturday night at one of the most famous venues in sport, followed by next weekend at another iconic address. GO DEEPER How a Notre Dame alumnus helped Army turn back to the option and its winning ways Here are three keys for Notre Dame vs. Army, plus a prediction. Notre Dame’s passing game has been a work in progress all season, but there have been flickers of sustained success the past few weeks as Riley Leonard seems to be growing into Mike Denbrock’s playbook. For example, all six of Notre Dame’s top receivers caught passes against Virginia, a first since Texas A&M. That’s on top of two tight ends and two running backs. Any idea the Irish would have a true go-to receiver has felt like wishful thinking since training camp, but Notre Dame now looks like it has an offense where any target can produce depending on the coverage. And depending on the quarterback seeing the opportunity. “I think it’s (Leonard) knowing where all the pieces are, right?” Denbrock said. “And if he does get into trouble, where can I go with it? Or if I need to move in the pocket, where is everybody at? You know what I mean? “I think it’s evolved as the season has gone along where he’s gotten a better feel for where all the pieces are. And he knows and I believe he has a lot of confidence in all the guys that are out there doing the job that if I give ’em a chance, they’ll make a play. And guys have been doing that.” After Beaux Collins looked like a potential WR1 at Texas A&M, everyone else has flashed at one point or another since. Last week that was Jayden Harrison, the third of three grad transfers at wide receiver and an addition who felt more like a special teams threat than a true wideout when he signed. Instead, Harrison posted three catches for 41 yards and a touchdown against Virginia, which doesn’t include his long touchdown called back by penalty. Advertisement “On any given play, we got so many guys who can play so many different positions on the receiving end that I look out there and I’m like, ‘OK, he’s playing the one to the field, oh now he’s in the boundary, no worries,’” Leonard said. “Half the time, I don’t even have to look out there, I know these guys can make plays no matter what.” Army’s quarterback is unlike anything Notre Dame has faced this season, including Navy’s Blake Horvath last month. Both run the option, but that doesn’t mean they run it the same way. In Army’s 14-3 win over North Texas two weeks ago, Daily ran 36 times for 153 yards and both touchdowns. It was a spike in job share for Daily, although he’s still averaging nearly 23 rushing attempts per game. That means Notre Dame should have two-dozen chances to hit the 6-foot, 221-pound quarterback. The Irish know they need to take advantage. “We gotta wrap him up,” said defensive coordinator Al Golden. “We gotta find ways to get him on the ground. We need multiple hats there. It all starts up front. We gotta direct the ball where our extra hat is and not allow them to gain an advantage at the point of attack.” With the Navy performance already banked, Notre Dame should gain some benefit from already stopping an option team. The Irish just don’t want to overstate the magnitude of that edge, though. Daily won’t throw it nearly as much as Horvath. And Army seems more likely to stick to its plan if it falls behind early. “That’s the first thing we cautioned the staff and the players about on Sunday is to think there’s going to be a continuation. There’s not. This is a clean break,” Golden said. “This is a different DNA: how they formation, how they are structured, where they want to attack the ball. So, it’s different. There’s certainly some crossover. I’m not saying that. But I’m saying overall the M.O. is different than Navy.” Advertisement Army leads the nation in rushing yards per game at 334.9, more than 70 yards per game ahead of second-place UCF. Defensive tackle Howard Cross III remains questionable after suffering an ankle sprain two weeks ago against Florida State. GO DEEPER Army and its 'fanatical' coach aim for perfection. But is that enough? Notre Dame has carved out an identity in the final four minutes of the first half and the opening four minutes of the second half this season, situational football called “the middle eight” and popularized by Bill Belichick. The theory goes that a coach can manipulate the clock at the end of the second quarter to create an extra possession (or limit one), then get the ball to start the second half and put daylight between itself and an opponent. During Notre Dame’s eight-game win streak, the Irish are winning the middle eight 97-0. That’s after playing Texas A&M and Northern Illinois to a 0-0 draw during the final four minutes of the first half and the first four minutes of the second. Freeman doesn’t see this success as random. “I think we emphasize the two-minute offense and defense every week,” Freeman said. “We go good on good with different situations. Every single week, it could be the end of half, end of a game situation, but every week, our guys know we’re going to get a good-on-good period that we have to execute.” Freeman created the end-of-half scenarios in practice almost by accident, counseling with athletic trainer Rob Hunt about load management in practice. That led to Freeman giving the team a mid-practice break. Then it led to simulating the end-of-half before the pause, followed by the start of the third quarter afterward. “I’ve continued that throughout the year because I think it’s a great way to simulate a game,” Freeman said. “Hey, take a quick break. It could simulate the end of a series or end of the half, that horn blows, reload, refocus and let’s go.” Advertisement Army has won the middle eight 48-10 through nine games. When Army fell behind by a field goal during the first quarter at North Texas, it marked the first time the Black Knights had trailed all season. That deficit lasted less than six minutes. That’s how dominant Army has been all season. It’s also a nod to the schedule the Black Knights have played, including four coaches who have been fired and an FCS team. Notre Dame is a huge step up. And Army knows it, which might be to the Black Knights’ benefit. Notre Dame flexes its muscle but never gets inside Army’s head (see: Navy’s six turnovers), which is enough to pull away in the fourth quarter.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Maple Leafs' Nick Robertson is trying to break the biggest slump of his career,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938544/2024/11/22/maple-leafs-nick-robertson-2/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:10:08 GMT",Nick Robertson has one goal this season and is struggling to adjust to a new system. A new opportunity may help.,"NHL This is something new for Nick Robertson: A prolonged offensive slump. Robertson scored a ton in junior. He scored a bunch (when he was healthy) with the Toronto Marlies. In his first extended opportunity with the Toronto Maple Leafs last season, Robertson pumped in 14 goals and 27 points in 56 games playing 11.5 minutes a night – the equivalent of a 21-goal, 40-point season. He led the Leafs with five goals in the preseason. Advertisement So yeah, this – one goal in the first 17 games of his second full NHL season – is new for Robertson. And he’s trying to figure it all out. Trying to change his game. Trying to learn, for the first time in his hockey-playing life, how to draw confidence from subtler aspects of the game that don’t involve the scoresheet. When we spoke earlier this month, Robertson was feeling “pretty good” about the way his season was going despite the non-existent production. And weirdly, at that point anyway, I kind of agreed. No, he wasn’t scoring or contributing to the offence. And while that was obviously a problem for him, Robertson looked like he was becoming a more well-rounded player. He was less of a liability. He was taking care of the puck. He was holding his own defensively, even with less cushy deployment. “As frustrating as it gets, I’ve got to stay confident in what I’ve done and how I’ve been playing,” Robertson said then. “It’s not like I’ve been playing bad. I think I’m playing pretty good hockey. Some games are so-so, but overall I think I’ve been playing pretty good. The production, hopefully, will come soon as the season goes on.” Robertson’s lone goal – lone point – came late in a blowout loss to Columbus on Oct. 22, more than a month ago. Even amid injuries to a whole whack of forwards, his ice-time hasn’t gone up. He logged only 10.5 minutes in the Leafs’ win over Vegas on Wednesday, second-fewest among the forwards (not including the injured Matthew Knies). He is playing only a little more than last season, but not much. All this in a contract year for the 23-year-old, who might get a shot with William Nylander when the Leafs play Utah on Sunday night with Knies out. Robertson is trying to tweak his game to unlock more offence and also suit the style of his new head coach, Craig Berube. Advertisement Arguably no Leaf, except maybe Max Domi, has been more hurt by the team’s Berube-led reluctance to rush chance than Robertson. Most of the 14 goals he scored last season were generated that way. It was a lot of this:  The kind of opportunities which are basically non-existent for the Leafs these days. Which explains why Robertson is determined to chase down more pucks, thieve them back on the forecheck, and create opportunities for himself and others that way. Just as his coach would like. You can kinda see what that looks like during a recent game against Ottawa, where Robertson’s tenacity eventually wins him control of the puck. “I think for me, I’ve gotten better at stealing pucks and want to do an even better job at it because that’s where, (playing on the) third line, I’m gonna get offence,” Robertson said. “I gotta get the puck back, I gotta find ways to get myself into the game with that, and just focus on the puck retrievals, trying to get the puck on my stick.” Unlike Knies or Bobby McMann, however, Robertson is at a physical disadvantage for doing that kind of thing. As the smallest player on the Leafs, at 5-foot-9 and 178 pounds, it’s simply harder for Robertson to knock defenders off the puck. He knows this. “I’m a small guy,” Robertson said. “For me, it’s a lot of quickness, lifting sticks, being deceptive, reading where the (defencemen) are.” Robertson believes he’s gotten better at that, slowing the game down and reading where defenders will be. He also watches his star teammates closely. While Mitch Marner, Auston Matthews, and William Nylander draw praise mostly, and understandably, for the splashy offence they produce, all three are elite puck thieves. “I think that’s a reason why they get a lot of offence, because they steal pucks,” Robertson said. “And I think for me, it’s learning how to use my body type to my advantage to steal pucks. I’m trying to do that better.” Advertisement Marner isn’t that much bigger – at 6-foot and 180 pounds – than Robertson. In Robertson’s estimation, Marner is shrewd in how he picks and chooses “when he’s gonna go hard at a guy or when he’s gonna be patient.” Robertson hasn’t stolen enough pucks though, and generated offence off of that, to make up for the lack of rush opportunities he gets these days. He’s struggled to get shots off and get them from in tight, where, like most players, he’s more likely to score. Consider his shot map last season:  To this season:  Part of the problem: Too many of Robertson’s attempts are getting blocked or missing the net entirely. He’s been blocked 17 times in 17 games and missed the net another 17 times. In every game, one attempt is getting swatted away and another isn’t hitting the goal. That feels like a lot for a guy playing 12 minutes a night. Robertson has finished with exactly one shot in 12 of his 17 games. He continues to have a limited role on the power play, where his heavy shot could theoretically cause more damage. It’s hard to score with so few opportunities, especially when those opportunities are almost entirely self-created. Robertson did his best work last season playing with Domi, a high-end playmaker. His most frequent linemate this season is Pontus Holmberg, who doesn’t have those same skills. “Everyone’s so quick and so good defensively. I think you get shots mostly on broken plays and wearing teams down on the forecheck,” Robertson said. “It’s so hard to get shots on the inside. A lot of it is you’re getting it off a rebound inside there or you’re getting a breakaway or two-on-one. It’s so hard to really get inside. One thing Robertson spotted on video that he can improve on: Jump on more split-second opportunities to cut into the middle and shoot the puck. He’s trying to find some silver lining in this dry spell, which has seen him go 10 straight games without a point. Advertisement “I think it’s a blessing in disguise for me to teach me patience and taking pride in other areas of my game to be confident, so that when things aren’t going (well offensively) I can take pride in the things like winning puck battles, getting to the right spots, getting in the (shooting) lane (as a defender). I take more pride in that than I did last year,” Robertson said. Robertson has been on the ice for only two five-on-five goals against all season. That’s partly a product of great goaltending. However, the underlying defensive numbers for Robertson have been solid and improved from last season, albeit facing third and fourth lines for the most part. That won’t be enough though. The puck needs to start going in. Eventually, the details won’t be enough.

Manager Tata Martino officially announced his resignation due to personal reasons at the same press conference. The Athletic reported the news on Tuesday. Advertisement “(Messi’s) under contract through 2025,” Mas said. “Leo and I sit and we’ll discuss the future. As I’ve said it before and I will repeat now: I fully expect in the opening of our new stadium in 2026 in Miami and the opening of our 2026 season — hopefully, after a trophy-laden 2025 campaign — that Lionel Messi will be our No. 10.” Miami’s new stadium, dubbed Miami Freedom Park, was originally slated to open next year but in September, the club announced that they will move to the new ground in 2026. Messi’s future both with club and country has remained uncertain. The eight-time Ballon d’Or winner, fresh off a World Cup triumph with Argentina in 2022, has long kept the door open to defending that title when the tournament is held in North America. Messi, though, has finished his 2024 season. Miami were eliminated by Atlanta United in the MLS Eastern Conference quarterfinals on November 9. He played in two World Cup qualifiers for Argentina last week and will not be active competitively until the new year. Messi spoke about his long-term future and love of Barcelona earlier on Friday, in an interview with Catalonian outlet 3Cat. “My kids were born here,” the 37-year-old said. “I’ve spent my whole life living there. I feel I belong to Barcelona. “My family and I always think about the possibility of returning to live there one day. My children, my wife and I miss our life there a lot. We miss our friends.” GO DEEPER How Lionel Messi and Inter Miami will be impacted by Tata Martino's exit When he returns from that extended time off, Messi will welcome a new head coach to Miami. Reports have linked his former Argentina and Barcelona teammate Javier Mascherano as the frontrunner to replace Martino. Mascherano is currently the head coach of Argentina’s U-20 men’s side. On Friday, Mas appeared to all but confirm the hire, saying that the ideal candidate should have the ability to relate to Messi, Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and Luis Suarez. Advertisement “We’re very close to finalizing a deal with a new coach,” Mas said. “We’ll make the announcement in the coming days. I spoke to Lionel on Saturday after he and Tata had spoken. I asked him, ‘What is important to you and what is important to get the best out of our roster and starting XI. How do we improve?’ Leo shared his thoughts with me. “This is a very attractive position for a coach. We got it down to three final candidates by Tuesday. Familiarity with Leo and the other stars is an advantage in every aspect. “I want Leo to feel comfortable with the new coach who is coming in. Raul (Sanllehi, president of football operations) and I will spearhead this. Leo gave me what I asked him, which is input. That was Leo’s involvement and engagement, which is frankly all the time.” Mas, during his 40-minute press conference, said that a coach with MLS experience “would be good” but that it isn’t the deciding factor. “I think the development of the club’s (footballing) identity is more important. How do you manage a squad that has unlimited talent? Because the best version of Inter Miami has not been seen yet.” Martino revealed that he had made the decision to resign before the start of Miami’s three-game series with Atlanta, adding that it’s “strictly personal.” “I have to leave Inter Miami,” Martino said. “We can’t come back and I have to go back to Rosario.” Martino first communicated his decision to Sanllehi. He then met with Messi before speaking with Mas. “No-one on my staff knew about this final decision,” said Martino. “I didn’t want to create a distraction. Inter Miami is a very demanding environment. It can be entrapping. But I’m very happy to have been part of the club’s turnaround. We do leave with a sour taste in our mouths after the elimination.” Advertisement Martino was asked about his relationship with Messi, one that has been scrutinized for nearly a decade. The 61-year-old Martino has coached Messi on three separate occasions. First at Barcelona in 2014, followed by two seasons as Argentina’s manager from 2015 to 2016. “This is the closest we’ve been after three stints together,” added Martino. “It has a lot to do with my own professional growth and Messi’s place in world football today. It was the best time we’ve spent together.” Martino said that he will not consider any new coaching offers for several months.

Well, louder in the sense that Ryan can’t stop talking about it. He’s said it across various appearances on ESPN, he said it in an interview with the ESPN radio station in New York on Thursday, and he said it during his appearance on the “Pardon My Take” podcast on Friday morning. If you pass him on the street, he’ll tell you too. Advertisement “I’ve let everybody know I’d be interested even though I’ve got a great gig” at ESPN, Ryan said on “Pardon My Take.” “I have some unfinished business with that franchise … I just think I would get back in it if I could make a difference and I could make a difference with that team.” He added: “If I took over it’d be turned (around) in about two minutes.” Ryan also said that “I know if I get the opportunity to interview for it I’m going to get the job.” In Ryan’s defense, perhaps he knows how much owner Woody Johnson hears what people are talking about on social media. So if Ryan talks enough, maybe Johnson will hear him. Rex Ryan on @PardonMyTake, on the #Jets job: (Would you like to save the #Jets?) “I’d like to. I’ve let everybody know I’d be interested even though I’ve got a great gig (at ESPN) … I have some unfinished business with that franchise … I just think I would get back in it if I… — Zack Rosenblatt (@ZackBlatt) November 22, 2024  A potential Ryan return is a fun idea to talk about weeks before the Jets actually start their search. He’s still the last Jets coach to make the playoffs, in 2010. That was also the last time they were respected as a team to reckon with around the NFL. But that was 14 years ago, and focusing on that ignores everything that happened after that 2010 playoff run, and really what led to that success in the first place. Let’s start from the beginning: Ryan’s best results in New York came in his first two years, when he inherited the team that Eric Mangini built. They went 9-7 in 2008, Mangini’s last year, when they started hot (8-3) but faltered once an aging Brett Favre got injured. To Ryan’s credit, he did build the Jets defense into one of the league’s best, but the offense never really took off and even as he shuffled through offensive coordinators over the years, they never steered away from a “ground-and-pound” attack. Advertisement In the PMT interview, Ryan said the Jets current offense, put together by Aaron Rodgers and Nathaniel Hackett, and since taken over by Todd Downing, is “about 20 years behind its time. That’s the old West Coast type stuff. They talk like they’re geniuses and the great thing is I love playing against them because I can tell where every damn play is going. I haven’t coached for eight years and can tell you every play. That’s gotta be flushed out. You gotta get up with the times offensively.” Well, there’s not really any evidence that Ryan knows how to run a modernized offense, nor is it clear what offensive coordinator would want to work with him. GO DEEPER Why Joe Douglas never stood a chance as Jets GM Now, look at what happened after the Jets’ two successful playoff runs, in 2009 and ’10: They were a massive disappointment in 2011, going 8-8, when they were definitely hurt by the loss of legendary offensive line coach Bill Callahan (he was lured away by the offer to call plays for the Dallas Cowboys). It only got worse from there. Offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer left after 2011 and was replaced by Tony Sparano, who was fired a year later and replaced by Marty Mornhinweg. From 2012 to ’14, the Jets went 18-30 and ranked 31st in offensive EPA, 18th in defensive EPA, 29th in offensive yardage, 32nd in passing yards, 31st in red zone success rate and 31st in scoring. Ryan had Geno Smith — who has since become a quality starting quarterback — and failed to develop him. In two seasons with Ryan as his head coach, Smith threw for 25 touchdowns and 34 interceptions. In 2013, Ryan, confoundingly, inserted Mark Sanchez into a preseason game in which Sanchez suffered a season-ending injury, thus forcing Smith into the starting lineup before he was ready. This quarterback part is notable since Ryan wouldn’t be inheriting a good quarterback situation. Rodgers likely isn’t returning — that becomes even less likely if Ryan is the coach. So Ryan would be the one tasked with shepherding a team led by, potentially, Tyrod Taylor and/or a rookie. After Ryan was fired by the Jets in 2014, he became the Buffalo Bills head coach, didn’t succeed there (two seasons, no playoff appearances) and was fired. There’s also this: He hasn’t coached in the NFL, in any capacity, since the Bills fired him after the 2016 season. He interviewed to be the Cowboys defensive coordinator this offseason but Dallas picked Mike Zimmer instead. Advertisement Perhaps Ryan has learned a lot over the last decade as an ESPN analyst. One of his comments on PMT was somewhat encouraging, when he said the Jets offense needs to huddle quickly and use more pre-snap motion to get into “a great play.” But there’s not any past evidence that he’d run an offense like that. GO DEEPER The Jets' QB options in 2025 — with or without Aaron Rodgers Ryan’s Jets tenure didn’t end nearly as well as it started. His message wasn’t resonating as much in the locker room and he left a sour taste with some in terms of the way he exited. Per ESPN at the time, after getting fired Ryan addressed the team briefly, “revealing little emotion” and instead of giving a speech showed a Jets highlight film. He didn’t get along with then-general manager John Idzik (though it’s not as if Idzik has the best resume as GM either). It appears the Jets intend to hire a general manager before their next head coach, and there likely aren’t many prospective general managers that would be excited about hiring a 61-year-old who hasn’t coached in the NFL since 2016. There’s also the nature of Ryan’s TV gig: He’s been highly critical of NFL coaches and players in his role — including Jets players and coaches — and that caught some steam recently when he directed vitriol at Cowboys star Micah Parsons, who pushed back. There aren’t many modern NFL players left who know Ryan for the kind of head coach he was — to them, he’s just a boisterous ESPN personality. This is a much different NFL than the one he left behind, in terms of the physicality, the signature of his best defenses. Would his messaging resonate the same way it once did? Since Ryan last coached, the NFL has made it harder for coaches to conduct physical training camps. Two-a-days were killed off in 2011. Ryan, though, doesn’t need to convince writers or fans right now. He just needs to convince one person: Woody Johnson. And he might be right: If Ryan gets in a room with Johnson for a job interview, he has the personality, ideas and proven track record of success with the Jets to win the owner over. It would be an easy sell, in Johnson’s mind, to the fan base — and at the end of the day, Johnson wants to sell tickets. There are a couple examples over the years of head coaches returning to the job years after leaving. Art Shell coached the Raiders from 1990-94 and made the playoffs three times. He was hired again in 2006, went 2-14 and was promptly fired. Joe Gibbs coached Washington from 1981-92, won three Super Bowls, retired, then came out of retirement in 2004 to coach them again. In four seasons, Washington made the playoffs twice before Gibbs retired again. Ryan wants his own second chance. It wouldn’t be a good idea.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Eric Ramsay interview: ‘At Minnesota United, we’ve found a version of ourselves which is exciting and dynamic’",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938919/2024/11/22/eric-ramsay-interview-minnesota-mls/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 17:35:37 GMT",The head coach discusses his tactics and philosophy as he prepares his side for their meeting with LA Galaxy on Sunday,"MLS This year has played out at a breakneck pace for Eric Ramsay. In January, he was an assistant coach in Erik Ten Hag’s backroom working to restore Manchester United to their former glories. Come March, he departed for a transatlantic opportunity, becoming Minnesota United’s second head coach since joining MLS in 2017. He joined a team that hadn’t lost any of its first four games, and sustained that momentum to reach the playoffs after they missed out in 2023. Advertisement Speaking on a blustery November day in Minneapolis, Ramsay has had a relatively mundane past few weeks. His team pulled off a first-round upset against Real Salt Lake in the first round, but three full weeks will have passed between that advancement and their matchup with the LA Galaxy (Sunday, November 24, at 5 p.m. Central). It’s been a rare lull in this high-octane season — and one with several key players away on international duty. The 32-year-old met with The Athletic to discuss his rapid entry into the MLS coaching ranks, the “three distinct phases” of his first season, what guides his approach to management, veteran Teemu Pukki’s decreasing workload, and much more. How have you found this first foray into being a senior head coach, and what are the differences between an assistant and head coaching roles? I’ve always been very intentional about how I build relationships with players, partly because I’ve always had that age question mark hovering over my relationships with senior players. As a consequence of that, I’ve found the transition relatively easy.  I’ve always leaned into my coaching and my ability to help a player develop as being the number one thing that sits between me and them. Other coaches talk about that in completely opposite terms, with it being the personal relationship to focus on first. I genuinely believe that, first and foremost, a player wants to feel like the coach is going to benefit the team — and to benefit them as a football player. I find that if you can do that, then the relationship just comes naturally. Almost to a man with the group that we’ve got now, I feel like I’m in a really good place with them.  There are a couple of guys on the team who are my age and think in a very similar way to me. I’ve tried to make sure that I bring those guys in, that we have a real leadership group. I give players some autonomy as to how the team plays and try to loop them in when it comes to some decision-making. It’s definitely something that I would take forward into any role that I take on in the future. During the interview process, chief soccer officer Khaled El-Ahmad stated the importance of hiring someone who was in ideological lockstep with his vision. How has that dynamic played out since you joined? I think we’ve naturally fallen into line. It’s been interesting: what this job has demanded from me is that ability to be pragmatic and adaptable. I think this league is one that demands that probably more than most. You’ve got the obvious things around geography and climate which means you can’t only do one thing in one way.  Advertisement We’ve used more players than any other MLS team. We’ve gone through three distinct phases of player availability. We’ve almost been victims of our own success earlier on — we did well with a squad that was pre-planned to be thin given the timing of my arrival and Khaled’s arrival. The nature of the early success meant that more players than probably planned were involved in their international teams. Those players went further (in summer tournaments) than expected, and then that misalignment between the European (transfer) window and this window, we were a victim of that as well.  If we’d set out at the beginning of the year and said we wanted the team to play in ‘X’ way, it would have been almost impossible. It would have been an absolute miracle to see real consistency across those three distinct groups, across 36 players, and to see a really cohesive outcome come the end of it. That’s interesting — I think younger coaches are stereotypically assumed to be strictly adhered to a philosophy of play, a curated system. How do you take your internal influences, ranging from result-obsessed pragmatism and staunch commitment to methodology above all else?  I would say I’ve really enjoyed the necessity — and I do sort of underline that word, necessity — to be pragmatic and adaptable with this group.  I’ve really enjoyed going from week to week and making sure that we are as competitive as possible, and that we’re as well-positioned for three points come the weekend as we can be. I’ve looked at our group, and I felt like we’ve got players that are very goal-orientated — they’re very direct. We’re not a team that’s necessarily cut out for dominating possession week on week.  I feel like over the course of the last 12 games, we’ve found a version of ourselves which is exciting and dynamic. It’s led to the team having more goals than the team’s ever scored over an entire year — but we are also very difficult to beat. We’re very solid, very strong defensively, really disciplined, really well-organized. I feel like that’s a nice blend, and it’s difficult to get a team that is very restrictive in terms of what the opposition is able to create.  Advertisement We’ve got a really good rhythm. We create a lot of chances. I think that makes, particularly at home, for a really exciting team to watch. You alluded to the last 12 games, beginning after the team exited the Leagues Cup in the group stage. That elimination afforded you several weeks of training that you didn’t enjoy by arriving after preseason. What did you work on in that span? When we’ve looked back at statistics over the course of this year, you just find that the whole season is hugely skewed by that middle period. We’ve tried not to draw too many conclusions from that period, in the sense that you felt like there were so many extenuating circumstances wrapped around that it almost renders that exercise pointless.   What this iteration of the team does well is restrict the number of high-quality chances that the opposition is going to get. We were good defensively in the first half of the season, but we were always good value — or bad value, depending on how you look at it — for the opposition getting one or two clear-cut chances. We’ve made some subtle tweaks to the way we press, and some of the detail in how we defend the wide areas has meant that the back line isn’t defending as much as it was. At our best, we’ve always been very tight from top to bottom, difficult to play through. We now have a better grasp and are more detailed, much more intentional, as to when we start off our pressure. Sitting beneath that now is a team that understands its roles. I’m really confident that, going into Saturday’s game, I know what I’m going to see as a baseline. That, for me, means I can spend the days when we get the group back together talking about the subtleties of the opposition, as opposed to trying to claw together some sense of solidity in ourselves. We’re talking during another long break, into a third week since you and the LA Galaxy knew you’d face off. I’d imagine it’s been an awkward time trying to sustain momentum without overthinking the matchup. Yeah, I’ve not enjoyed these two weeks. I don’t think anyone’s enjoyed them in a lot of senses, because it feels like we’ve trained without a lot of purpose. We’ve gone and lost seven or eight internationals. In one sense, it’s been nice, because we’ve tried to keep our training very general and fun. Sometimes what you find difficult — particularly when you settle on a lineup and there are very few injuries, and you’re rolling with a really good form — is that you get a sense of “starters and non-starters.” That is just the nature of our sport. I was keen for that not to continue over the course of this period, so we’ve obviously not wanted to work tactically yet. We’ve not wanted to talk about Galaxy; we’ve not wanted to talk about the possibility of this player starting or that player starting. In the same breath, it’s then two weeks of just plodding along, I would say. I’m sure the players would feel the same. So, refreshing in one sense, but largely frustrating. It’s an odd dynamic, I’ll say. Does that short run-up become easier when you play a team that’s so stylistically different in terms of their view of possession? It’s an interesting one, because they are sort of predictably unpredictable. Even if I had 10 days with the full group, it wouldn’t be that I could nail down the three or four patterns that they will typically execute that are going to cause us a lot of problems. Advertisement Their danger lies in the unpredictability of the individuals in the middle of the pitch; Riqui Puig is huge in that sense. He has complete freedom to pop up in any part of the pitch that he would like to, so they’re not particularly positional. It’s then very difficult for you to be really concrete in how you solve every particular situation. It’s much more about how you execute principles, which is something that I talk about a lot, and how typically when we do that well, we can leave ourselves in a really good place. I also don’t want to underdo what we are able to do with the ball in organized possession. As much as we don’t often have more than 40 to 45 per cent of it, when we use it well, we use it with a really good rhythm. We’ve got players that we can get into positions that can cause real danger. I would say with Robin (Lod), we have one of the more creative, dangerous, crafty players between the lines in the league. We’ve obviously got Kelvin (Yeboah), Joaquin (Pereyra), Bongi (Hlongwane), (Joseph) Rosales — we’ve got plenty for them to think about as well. I certainly won’t be leaving our group feeling that we’re going to spend 80 per cent of the game defending and counter-attacking, because we can be and will be much more than that. One big decision you’ve made this season regards your striker depth chart. Teemu Pukki appears to sit third despite being the team’s highest earner, trailing Yeboah and Tani Oluwaseyi for minutes. How has managing that situation gone? Yeah, it’s been an interesting challenge in that sense, and I’ve approached it as I approach relationships with all the players: I’m really open, I’m really honest with players. I try to make it very clear what the expectations are, how I want the team to play, what the demands are on individuals, positions, and relationships. If players don’t fall into that, then I make it very clear as to why that’s the case. I think I have a good relationship with Teemu. I think he’s a really good guy. He’s hit the levels that he has as a consequence of ability, but also of professionalism and work and a real love for being in front of the goal and scoring goals. I’ve really taken that from this year with him, but he’d be the first to admit: it hasn’t been the year that he would have expected, and certainly not the year that probably the club had planned for Teemu.  Managing that hasn’t been easy. It’s not been easy for Teemu. He’s someone who wants to be on the pitch and wants to play, and he’s obviously experiencing a different period in his career. As best I can, we’ve tried to help him with that. I’m sure as we sit here now, there’s still a big contribution left for him in this team for sure. I don’t think anyone envisages a situation where we’re chasing the goal on Saturday, in which he’s not considered to come on because the ball seems to gravitate toward him. He’s one of those guys: a bit of a magnet for the ball in the box. Advertisement Before the 2018 World Cup, Gareth Southgate was in Minnesota for the Super Bowl. He later said that he learned a lot about curating set pieces from watching the Timberwolves, and you’ve also been spotted courtside at NBA games. Have you taken any cues from American sports? I love watching basketball courtside and being able to appreciate it. The level of concentration from a defensive perspective is insane. I feel like if you could get a group of footballers across 11 players to execute with that level of concentration and detail, you’d have a team that’s almost impossible to beat. Obviously, in basketball, the level of consequence that is wrapped around each action is so much more than in football. If you’re beaten one-v-one in the middle third, you’ve still got possibly half a pitch and six or seven players to beat before you get anywhere near the action being really consequential. In basketball, any wrong slip is incredibly consequential. I feel like when I sit courtside and I watch players that dialled in, it’s something I’d love to bottle and give our players to drink. If we could go another level in that sense, that would be impressive. I also feel like just being around that sport and talking to coaches, that idea of individual matchups is the essence of sport. I think our sport has become so tactical. Everyone is very concerned about the collective and knitting together the roles of player one to player 11, relative to how the opposition plays, that sometimes you just lose that essence of like, ‘Well, this guy is on fire. Let’s get him the ball.’ We have to try and engineer these 1v1 situations — it’s sometimes lost. I think that the basics, the essence of sport, are being brought back to my attention by watching some of that stuff. Since you left Manchester United, “Peak Barclays” has surfaced as a meme, a yearning for less predictable play models. Generally, young coaches are lauded for incorporating data analytics into their planning. Where do you fall between those two extremes? I’m really keen to not lose sight of what are some of the really important things in sport. I really like the sort of romance in the essence of sport: the moments and the individuals and their strengths. I think, as a coach, I’m much more drawn toward how you knit all that together, and don’t lose sight of what it is that these players did to become professionals. I feel like that’s the art of coaching.  GO DEEPER 'Take me back to the 2000s': Premier League nostalgia and the perils of comparing different eras  I would consider myself a modern coach, a progressive coach who has a really good grasp of data and sports science, and I can think from one end of the spectrum to the other when it comes to philosophy. I understand the component parts. I understand the mechanism to produce a team that can play in one way and a team that can play in a way that looks very different. Advertisement But I don’t want to lose sight of the fact that sport is about individuals. It is about matchups. It is about team chemistry. I also feel like coming to Minnesota, coming to MLS, has given me the chance to play with that a little bit, because there’s no preconceived idea of what I was going to bring as a coach, what the team was going to do. That sort of blank canvas has been good from our perspective, for sure. It might be an awkward time for this question — because you have one to three games left this season — but thinking ahead of 2025, do you have a sense of how you want to evolve your approach and your system?  I’ve got a really clear idea of how I want the team to look. I feel in the last 10 or 12 games, we are moving much closer to a version of that. What we’ve seen at home over the last three games, we’ve been in a really good place.  I sort of reaffirm what I said earlier in the sense that, at home in those games, the team has been very difficult to beat; really compact, really well-organized, and given away very little. When it’s had the ball, it’s played with a really good rhythm. It’s attacked quickly. It’s created loads and loads of really clear-cut chances. It looked really dynamic, really pacey and threatening at the top of the pitch. I would like to be a more refined, higher-quality version of that team next year. I feel if we can get to that point, then we’ll be a real threat. English coaches working abroad are inevitably assessed with one eye on the Premier League, especially when your previous employer is Manchester United. Do you think about your personal mid-to-long-term plan? Not really. Contrary to what people think when they look at my career, I’ve never been desperate to keep taking the next step. It’s just that at each club I’ve been at, it’s gotten to a point where I’m ready for the next thing and opportunities start to arrive. This was one of those, and I assume the next one will be similar. I’m in no rush to necessarily get back to England. I have no preconceived idea as to exactly where the next step will be, but I’m obviously one that’s open-minded to (an opportunity) that’s not in England. I feel I’ve opened the world a little bit by coming here, and I’ve really enjoyed the nature of MLS. It’s the most multicultural league in the world, I really wanted to make sure that I continue to cut my teeth in a multilingual environment. I wouldn’t be in a rush to lose that in any way. Of course, we feel like we’ve got real momentum here and we’re onto a really good thing, so I want to make sure that whilst I’m here, that continues to build.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,'We hate the Lions': Why sportsbooks are scared of a Detroit Super Bowl win,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940518/2024/11/22/detroit-lions-super-bowl-betting-2024/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 17:19:07 GMT","As the Lions roar towards a playoff berth, betting money has followed, making a Detroit Super Bowl win a major liability for sportsbooks.","Sports Betting The Detroit Lions’ Week 11 52-6 dismantling of the Jacksonville Jaguars, combined with the Kansas City Chiefs’ 30-21 loss to the Buffalo Bills, vaulted the Lions into a unique position. For one of the few times in the history of the franchise, they became the consensus Super Bowl favorite at around +325 odds. In fact, by the account of several oddsmakers, it’s likely the first time the team has been favored to win the title in 70 years. After all, the Lions have only made the playoffs 18 times since 1935. Advertisement That status has also positioned the Lions as the team most likely to keep those oddsmakers up at night after roaring to a 9-1 start this season. After last season’s inspiring run to the NFC Championship Game, the money has poured in on Detroit, which could cost sportsbooks significantly in payouts to bettors if the Lions were to win Super Bowl LIX. “They’re by far our biggest Super Bowl liability and pretty much our only one at this point,” BetMGM trader Christian Cipollini told The Athletic. “Anything inside of 10-1 [odds] we don’t tend to build crazy liability that we’re worried about, but everybody has been on them. At this point, the Lions winning the Super Bowl would be a huge problem for us. If I could remove them from futures, I would.” Adding to the growing liability on Detroit, fans tend to favor their home team with their wagers, and Michigan is one of the 38 states with legal sports betting (and the 10th-largest by population). The Lions opened the offseason in the 12-1 range to win the Super Bowl, but those odds have dropped significantly to just over 3-1 since. The betting money has followed that success. “The betting momentum in favor of Detroit started prior to the season as they attracted a large number of Super Bowl future wagers,” said Brad Bryant, general manager at Mohegan Sun FanDuel Sportsbook, noting the Lions have been one of the Mohegan Sun’s “top-wagered teams on a weekly basis.” At DraftKings Sportsbook, 31 percent of bets (No. 1 among NFL teams) and 31 percent of total dollars wagered (also No. 1) were on Detroit to win the Super Bowl earlier this week. The Lions are third in ticket count for Super Bowl futures at The Borgata in Atlantic City, where sportsbook director Thomas Gable noted Detroit has the most total dollars wagered to win the Super Bowl “by a pretty good stretch.” Advertisement “We hate the Lions,” Cipollini said, adding that the number of bets on the Lions is the first thing that he looks at every week. “I haven’t seen something like this in my time at BetMGM. Every single week, they’re our worst team. I think something like 95 percent of the bets last week [vs. the Jaguars] were on Detroit.” With an NFC-best 9-1 record and winners of eight straight games, the Lions have vaulted from a top-five preseason power rating among oddsmakers to the consensus No. 1 team in the league. Out of 10 oddsmakers The Athletic polled, nine of them had the Lions as their highest power-rated team. (One had the Baltimore Ravens slightly above Detroit.) The Lions also have the NFL’s best record at 8-2 against the spread, and bettors placing a moneyline wager or standard six-point teaser on Detroit have cashed that ticket in nine of 10 weeks. And the action isn’t only in Michigan. Bookmakers noted the increased interest in betting the Lions at several sportsbooks from Mississippi to Las Vegas. “That’s 100 percent true,” Ed Salmons, vice president of risk at The Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook, said. “Weekly bets on Lions point spread, moneyline, teasers and game over and Lions team total over.” Several other oddsmakers agreed, noting they’d seen an increase in betting on the Lions compared to previous seasons and that the public was regularly tossing Detroit in moneyline parlays and teasers. In the upcoming Week 12, Lions at -7.5 is currently the most-bet Week 12 side by both total money and tickets at BetMGM and DraftKings. “[The public] will include Detroit in parlays and tease the spread down,” The Borgata’s Gable noted. “We opened [with] the Lions -8 against the Colts [in Week 12] and took respected money right away against the Colts. Now it’s 7.5.” It’s easy to see why the public is in love: The Lions are a ridiculous 41-16 ATS (72 percent) in their past 57 games since the middle of the 2021 season. That includes a 22-8 ATS mark in the first half since the start of last season. Double-digit favorites in the NFL are 5-0 ATS this season, and the Lions are responsible for two of those covers — the 52-6 laugher vs. Jacksonville as a 14-point favorite and a 52-14 demolition of the Tennessee Titans as a 13-point favorite. It’s one thing to cover a 14-point spread; it’s another to have it be a rocking-chair win. Advertisement Looking ahead to a potential title matchup, when six oddsmakers were asked to make a spread on a Chiefs-Lions matchup on a neutral field, their responses were: Lions -4.5
Lions -2.5
Lions -2
Lions -1.5
Lions -1
And one pick-em The oddsmaker framing the matchup as a pick-em explained, “One concern I have is the coach. When you talk about Detroit vs. the Chiefs and Andy Reid, there’s a big difference there. And the Lions haven’t gotten [to the Super Bowl] yet. The Chiefs have been there.” As the Lions keep steamrolling through teams, oddsmakers are certainly rooting against a Detroit Super Bowl victory. And history might be on their side. Several of the oddsmakers contacted by The Athletic, who have worked in sports betting since the 1970s, could not recall a time when Detroit had been favored to win pro football’s championship. Per Pro Football Reference, however, the Lions were favored by three points 70 years ago in the 1954 championship game against the Cleveland Browns … who obliterated the favorites by a score of 56-10.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,NFL moves Broncos-Chargers in Week 16 for first 'Thursday Night Football' flex,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940748/2024/11/22/broncos-vs-chargers-tnf-flex-week-16/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 16:57:54 GMT",AFC West divisional tilt between two playoff hopefuls replaces Browns vs. Bengals as Prime Video's game of the week.,"NFL By Nick Kosmider, Daniel Popper and Zac Jackson The NFL has flexed a game into a “Thursday Night Football” for the first time, moving the Denver Broncos’ Week 16 matchup at the Los Angeles Chargers into prime time on Dec. 19. The two teams, led by former Oregon quarterbacks Bo Nix and Justin Herbert, were originally set to play on Sunday afternoon, Dec. 22. The Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals game that was originally slated for Thursday night will now be played that Sunday at 1 p.m. ET on Fox. GO DEEPER Broncos' biggest turnaround this side of Bo Nix: A run defense with real bite NFL owners approved a rule change in 2023 that allowed games to be flexed into a Thursday slot between Weeks 13 and 17, with such moves requiring a four-week notice. The matchup means the Broncos will now play two prime-time games in December, the first coming against the Browns on “Monday Night Football” in Week 13. The matchup against the Chargers will give a national audience a look at Nix, who won the AFC Offensive Player of the Week award following his four-touchdown performance in a Week 11 rout of the Atlanta Falcons. Advertisement The Chargers, meanwhile, have won five out of their last six games under first-year head coach Jim Harbaugh — the first of those coming in a Week 6 win against the Broncos — and remain in the hunt for the AFC West title. The Broncos, who already played a Thursday night road game earlier this season against the New Orleans Saints, had to OK being flexed since this will be their second road Thursday night game of the season. They are embracing the switch, in part, because it will give them extended rest heading into a pivotal Week 17 road game against the Bengals. “We’d rather be flexed in than flexed out,” said Broncos coach Sean Payton. “It’s a real good team that is playing real good (football). And it flexes Cincinnati out, who we play the next week, so there is a little (rest consideration). It is what it is.” Payton said his 2006 Saints team was the first one to flexed into a Sunday night matchup, against the Dallas Cowboys, but he downplayed the history of being the first team flexed into a Thursday slot. “It’s all good,” he said. “Just tell us when we’re playing.” The Chargers have now been flexed into prime time for the second time this season. Their Week 11 matchup with the Bengals was moved from Sunday afternoon to Sunday night. That ended up being an epic game, with the Bengals erasing a 21-point second-half deficit before the Chargers pulled it out late on Herbert’s 15th career game-winning drive. GO DEEPER Justin Herbert paces Chargers in 23-16 win vs. Broncos: Takeaways The Chargers are interesting. The Chargers are exciting. They are good for business. And now, they will be playing four prime-time games in a six-week stretch, starting with last week’s Bengals game. They host the Baltimore Ravens on Monday night in Week 12. They play at the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday night in Week 14. — Daniel Popper, Chargers beat writer
 Advertisement Nix had a slow start to the season, throwing only one touchdown and four interceptions across his first four games. Since then, he’s arguably been the best rookie quarterback in the NFL (13 touchdowns, two interceptions), putting him firmly alongside players like Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels and Las Vegas Raiders tight end Brock Bowers in the Rookie of the Year race. The “Thursday Night Football” stage will give Nix the opportunity to make a major statement. This will be the third matchup between Nix and Herbert, including a college clash in 2019, when Herbert was at Oregon and Nix was a true freshman starter at Auburn. Nix led a late touchdown drive to win that game at AT&T Stadium in Dallas. Herbert came out on top in Week 6 this season. — Nick Kosmider, Broncos beat writer The Bengals aren’t out of contention yet, but from a playoff appeal standpoint, the move makes sense. The Bengals are probably disappointed because the home team has won nine straight AFC North Thursday night games dating back to 2015, a streak the Browns extended with their upset of the Steelers Thursday night. The Browns now could be looking at back-to-back flex situations; they’re currently scheduled to host Miami on Sunday night in Week 17. — Zac Jackson, Browns beat writer (Photo: Dustin Bradford / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

This road swing, meanwhile, represents both a significant challenge and an opportunity. The schedule itself isn’t imposing. Over the next 11 days, the Canucks will face off against a variety of weaker sides. Their opponents are effectively a who’s who of teams outside the Eastern Conference playoff spots before the road trip concludes with a matchup against Kirill Kaprizov’s impressive Minnesota Wild. It’ll be essential for the Canucks to sort themselves out on this trip and bank enough points to tread water in the divisional standings, and that should be achievable regardless of the difficulty of the club’s current circumstances. Let’s open our notebook and get into some of the pressing items surrounding the team and the big-picture questions that Canucks management is weighing at this crucial moment of the season. I asked around this week and on Thursday afternoon was able to confirm the roster mechanics of J.T. Miller’s leave. Miller, away from the club indefinitely for personal reasons, is currently off the Canucks’ 23-man roster as an Injured Non-Roster player. Injured non-roster functions the way that normal Injured Reserve does for the most part — Miller’s cap hit still counts on the books but the club gets an extra spot on the 23-man roster — the only exception is that it’s somewhat more flexible. A player placed on IR is ineligible to return for at least a week but Miller is eligible to be activated at any time. The flexibility is irrelevant in this instance. While Miller’s absence is indefinite, he won’t be back in under seven days and isn’t expected to return to the lineup for the duration of this road trip at the very least. Advertisement As Vancouver sets out on this marathon road trip, however, the club only has 22 active players on the 23-man roster and doesn’t have the flexibility to add a call-up from Abbotsford for the moment. Their flexibility isn’t limited by roster space, it’s actually about the salary cap. As we’ve covered exhaustively over the past several months, the Canucks want to avoid utilizing Long-Term Injured Reserve (LTIR), which would provide the club with some short-term cap flexibility but would prevent it from tolling cap space daily. With an eye toward maximizing its cap space and the ability to add talent to the roster ahead of the trade deadline, Vancouver is currently eschewing the use of LTIR, even in managing the status of players that would be eligible for it like Thatcher Demko and Derek Forbort. With Miller, Demko, Forbort and Brock Boeser all remaining on the books cap-wise, the Canucks are pressed up against the upper limit with 22 active players on the roster and not enough cap space remaining to call up a 23rd. While this will create something of a roster and cap crunch for the team at the outset of this road trip, the sense I get is that in Boeser, Demko and Forbort’s case, some reinforcements should begin arriving in relatively short order. The state of the Canucks blue line has been a hot topic for fans and media through the first six weeks of the season. While Quinn Hughes and Filip Hronek have been a dominant force on the top pair, and Erik Brännström and Vincent Desharnais have formed an effective, sheltered third pair, Carson Soucy and Tyler Myers have had a tough go as a duo through the first 18 games. In nearly 205 five-on-five minutes as a pair this season, Soucy and Myers have been outshot 106-58 and have been outscored by a commensurate margin (five goals for, 13 goals against). As well as they performed in the 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs the play of the second pair has been problematic in the early going this season, and the seams have been especially evident when Vancouver has battled higher-quality opponents with more dynamic attacking depth. Advertisement This is why the club is eager to get Forbort back into the lineup. Forbort’s return will give the Canucks another defender with size and, accordingly, more options to experiment and find solutions with different second-pair combinations. I do believe that size concerns have held Brännström back, as well as he’s performed, in terms of earning an elevated role in the lineup. That said, his usage is ticking up, and all indications are that the comfort level of Rick Tocchet and his staff with leaning on the 25-year-old defender appears to be increasing with each passing game. To this point, Soucy and Myers have remained a fixed pair for every game this season. If their struggles. continue for much longer, however, the club recognizes that it’ll have to consider trying something different to find an internal fix. It was roughly a year ago that the club acquired Nikita Zadorov in a trade with the Calgary Flames, a deal that was motivated by the Canucks’ desire to shore up the defence and protect their hot start to the 2023-24 campaign after Soucy got hurt. It wouldn’t be a surprise if general manager Patrik Allvin were able to pull off something similar for a second consecutive season. That said, as Vancouver’s hockey operations department weighs its options on the trade market, the calculus appears to be moderately different than it was when the club traded for Zadorov. When it comes to the state of the blue line, a topic that has long preoccupied Canucks hockey operations leadership since they arrived in Vancouver, the organization feels like they’re caught in between the present and the future and have to be mindful of precisely how they proceed. The club is excited about the progress that Cole McWard and Elias Pettersson have made in AHL Abbotsford. We’ll likely see both players given a look at the NHL level this season, with an eye on developing them into regular contributors within a year or two. Advertisement The Canucks are also delighted about Tom Willander’s progress this season, and his evolution as a more comfortable and dynamic attacking presence from the back end in his sophomore season at Boston University. The club will likely push to sign him after the conclusion of his NCAA season. In the WHL, Sawyer Mynio is tracking exceptionally well and is widely expected to be in the mix to play for Canada at the world juniors. The club has high hopes for his professional future after this season. The Canucks sorely need a top-four upgrade short-term, though, and are working to identify and acquire a player who matches that description, but their appetite to pay a significant price in a trade is shaped by a sense of internal confidence that in a year or two the club is poised to have some credible in-house options with potential on the back end. This is really the rub for Canucks management. Nearly every contender in the league is eager to land an additional top-four capable defender and the supply of potentially available trade targets is both meagre and somewhat uninspiring. As a result of this dynamic, the prices for those defenders that actually may shake loose are astronomically high at the moment. We know that this Canucks management group isn’t going to hesitate to pay retail price — they won’t even hesitate to overpay, as we saw with Hronek — if they’re able to land a defender who would qualify as a perfect fit. If it’s a credible, multiyear top-four upgrade, the Canucks will push hard and pay a steep price. If it’s an older rental defender that the club isn’t convinced will offer a significant enough upgrade over its current options, it sounds like Vancouver may be more reluctant to move proactively and pay full freight. The Canucks don’t intend to make a trade, it seems, solely for the purpose of shaking things up on their second pair. If they’re going to dig deep into their pockets to upgrade the blue line, and it’s clear that’s what it’s going to take, my sense of it is that they want to land a multiyear fit. This is also why the tongue-in-cheek invocation of Zadorov’s name by Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman on Thursday is an interesting one. Whether or not repatriating Zadorov is actually a sensible or realistic option for the club, the five years of term remaining on his deal might be a better fit with Vancouver’s big-picture priorities than one of the more prominently discussed rental options. Advertisement Before heading out east, the Canucks returned top prospect Jonathan Lekkerimäki to Abbotsford and called up 24-year-old centre Max Sasson. Sasson, who signed with the Canucks as a college free agent in the spring of 2023, has been a standout for Abbotsford but has yet to play an NHL game. Though he’s slight for a bottom-six centre, Sasson has a high motor, plus speed, above-average hockey IQ and NHL-level wheels. He’s been solidly productive in the AHL and is a natural centre, giving the Canucks some additional positional versatility. It seems very likely that Sasson will make his NHL debut at some point on this trip. As for Lekkerimäki, who appeared in five games and scored a goal, the club viewed this NHL stint as an unqualified success. Tocchet — and the organization more generally — was impressed by how Lekkerimäki’s game translated to the NHL level, and by his defensive conscientiousness in particular. Like with Arshdeep Bains and Aatu Räty earlier in the season, the club wanted to give Lekkerimäki a taste of the NHL with the intent of sending him back to Abbotsford to apply what he learned and continue to develop by dominating in the AHL. He’ll be back soon enough. In the case of all three players, but particularly Lekkerimäki given his pedigree, the club is hopeful that some of its younger forwards will be able to be contributors by the tail end of this season. Bains, who had an especially strong outing on Tuesday night against the New York Rangers, appears to be the player who seems closest to hitting that level.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Fantasy football flex fliers: Wan’Dale Robinson, Alec Pierce can help in Week 12",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940454/2024/11/22/fantasy-football-flex-fliers-week-12/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 16:07:53 GMT",Scott Engel tells you who to grab and play after waivers have passed for this Week 12 slate that has six teams on bye.,"Fantasy Football With six teams on byes in Week 12, the mad scramble for fantasy football lineup streamers continues after the initial waiver wire run and Thursday night game. Heading into every weekend, I pinpoint players who still may be available in free agency and players on the end of your fantasy bench who you can waive or tell to “get in there.” The analysis is based on PPR scoring, and players are listed in order of preference for pickup and lineup usage. Rostered percentages are from CBSSports.com. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Wan’Dale Robinson, WR, NYG (54 percent rostered): Robinson caught five balls on eight targets last week. Tampa Bay ranks 26th in receptions allowed to WRs, and Tommy DeVito has averaged 6.2 yards per attempt so far in his career, which would not rank in the top 30 at QB right now. The Giants’ new starting QB may not take too many downfield shots and will lean on Robinson to help him move the chains on critical downs. Advertisement Luke Schoonmaker, TE, DAL (7 percent): Jake Ferguson (concussion) is not expected to play against Washington, and Schoonmaker caught six of 10 targets last week. Cooper Rush posted better numbers in his second start of the season, and the tight end is a frequent target in Dallas’ passing game. Washington’s pass defense now ranks fifth overall, but at tight end, you are looking for opportunities over matchups when needing a lineup filler. GO DEEPER NFL Week 12 fantasy football, betting cheat sheet: Mike Evans, Isiah Pacheco near returns Xavier Legette, WR, CAR (53 percent): The matchup against the Chiefs seems daunting. But Legette was targeted six-plus times in two of the last three games and caught TD passes in three of his last four home games. Kansas City is also not a complete shutdown defense against WRs, ranking 13th in fantasy points per game allowed to the position. Alec Pierce, WR, IND (38 percent): The Lions may be the best team in the NFL right now, yet they can be vulnerable to the pass. Detroit ranks 29th in receiving yardage allowed to WRs, and Anthony Richardson will not hesitate to throw to his downfield specialist. Pierce might be productive in any game script, helping to keep the Colts close or boosting his numbers in catch-up mode. Nick Westbrook-Ikhine, WR, TEN (35 percent): A run of five TD receptions in six games certainly does not seem sustainable. That said, Westbrook-Ikhine has a knack for finding the end zone from anywhere on the field, and Houston has allowed an NFL-high 16 TD receptions to WRs, including six over the past four weeks. Ricky Pearsall, WR, SF (47 percent): Pearsall was a widely favored play against Seattle last week and was held without a reception. He posted double-digit PPR point totals in his previous two games, though. On Pro Football Focus for Week 12, Pearsall has a 76.0 WR/CB matchup grade as a slot receiver against Green Bay, which qualifies as “good.” Advertisement Jalen McMillan, WR, TB (32 percent): A Week 11 bye gave him more time to recover from a hamstring injury, and the return of Mike Evans should benefit McMillan in a complementary role vs. the Giants. Devaughn Vele, WR, DEN (3 percent): The first-year Bronco is a sizable target at 6-foot-5, 210 pounds. As noted by FantasyPros, the Raiders have allowed the most fantasy points per game to slot WRs since Week 6. Noah Brown, WR, WAS (29 percent): Consider the old and fun revenge game narrative here as Brown faces the Cowboys. Dallas ranks 20th in receiving yards allowed to WRs over the past four weeks, and Brown was targeted six-plus times in three of his last four games. Michael Wilson, WR, ARI (26 percent): Wilson has a 70.9 individual WR/CB grade (“good”) on PFF this week against Seattle, and the Seahawks defense will prioritize containing Marvin Harrison Jr. and Trey McBride. Ameer Abdullah, RB, LV (35 percent): Injuries might push Abdullah into a starting role against Denver, and rookie Dylan Laube (3 percent) should also be in the mix for carries. Abdullah is versatile enough to potentially post decent totals, and Laube is the desperation plug-and-play guy. DeMario Douglas, WR, NE (42 percent): Miami ranks fifth in fantasy points per game allowed to WRs, yet when searching for plug-in types, you usually won’t find an ideal option on the free agent list or at the end of the fantasy bench. Douglas posted nine-plus PPR points in each of his last three games. Gus Edwards, RB, LAC (49 percent): The surprising Chargers get a marquee matchup with Baltimore on Monday Night Football, and the former Raven might punch in a TD to finish a scoring drive. Trey Benson, RB, ARI (54 percent): Benson may be available in some leagues and logged 18 carries over the past two games. He is a quality complement to James Conner, who could rip off a sizable run or two or potentially get in the end zone in a big game vs. Seattle. Advertisement Theo Johnson, TE, NYG (9 percent): Johnson is another option for DeVito in the middle of the field. The Giants rookie has been targeted six times in each of the past two games. Sterling Shepard, WR, TB (8 percent): Shepard gets the revenge matchup against the Giants, so a TD reception is possible. When speaking with the media, Shepard expressed no animosity toward his former team, but it’s always fun for a player to make a notable contribution against his previous team. Ja’Tavion Sanders, TE, CAR (8 percent): Another deep rookie tight end option, Sanders deserves consideration because Kansas City ranks 29th in fantasy points per game allowed to TEs. Troy Franklin, WR, DEN (6 percent): Bo Nix’s Oregon teammate caught his second NFL TD pass last week, and the Las Vegas defense may spend a lot of time on the field this week. And Nix is coming off a four-TD outing. (Photo of Wan’Dale Robinson: Luke Hales / Getty Images)  Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Don Waddell enjoys fresh start with Blue Jackets but holds good feelings about Hurricanes,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5937782/2024/11/22/don-waddell-blue-jackets-hurricanes/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:58:00 GMT","As Carolina visits Columbus, Waddell reflects on why he made a necessary move last summer.","NHL COLUMBUS, Ohio — Don Waddell surprised many in the Carolina Hurricanes organization last May when he announced, only a day after the Hurricanes were bounced from the second round of the playoffs, that he was resigning as president and general manager. The rest of the hockey world learned of his decision about a week later, a major shake-up for one of the most consistently competitive franchises in the NHL in recent seasons. Advertisement “I’d been there 10 years, six as the president and general manager,” said Waddell, now general manager of the Columbus Blue Jackets. “It was a lot, beyond the day-to-day operation of the hockey club, plus an expansion project (with PNC Arena) and other projects. “I made the decision way before the end of the season that it was time for me to move on. It was just time to find the next chapter in my life. I was very much a personal feeling. Probably a lot of things went into it, but I just felt it was time.” As the guy who ran both the business side and on-ice product, Waddell had long-established relationships all over the Hurricanes organization. So it will be a mini-reunion on Saturday when the Blue Jackets host Carolina in Nationwide Arena, and a much bigger get-back-together when the Jackets play in Raleigh, N.C., on Dec. 15. “Any time you’re with a team for 10 years, you’ve got a lot of friends there, a lot of ties to the organization,” Waddell said. “The coaching staff, the trainers, the players, everybody in the office … I had a big staff there, and there are a lot of good friends I’ve stayed in touch with. “They’re a very good team. I think they have, what, three losses? I just want (the Blue Jackets) to play hard and play our best and hopefully we win the game.” Saturday’s game also marks the return to Columbus of forward Jack Roslovic, who, after 3 1/2 seasons in Columbus, was traded to the New York Rangers at the deadline last season. He signed with Carolina as an unrestricted free agent this summer. Roslovic, who is second on the Hurricanes with 10 goals in only 18 games, will almost certainly get a first-period “welcome back” video on the scoreboard. Waddell will have to wait until next month for his greeting in Raleigh, but Saturday is a testament to the status he’s achieved as an NHL executive. He’s now been a president and general manager of three franchises, including the expansion Atlanta Thrashers, who moved to Winnipeg in 2011. Advertisement The Hurricanes could never get over the hump to reach the Stanley Cup Final during Waddell’s run, but there were significant successes. What stands out? “When I went there initially as president (2014), our attendance was among the worst in the league,” Waddell said. “When I left, we were selling out every night. “When Rod (Brind’Amour) and I took over (the roster) — he as the coach and me as the general manager — we had missed the playoffs in nine straight years. We then made the playoffs six years in a row. From where we started and where it ended up — and they’re still going, obviously — I feel good about that. I think I left them in a good spot.” On May 16, Carolina lost Game 6 to the New York Rangers, ending their second-round series. The next day, a Friday, Waddell told Hurricanes owner Tom Dundon that he was stepping down, even though he didn’t have any future plans in place. Don Waddell, 66, was hired to run the Blue Jackets in May, and it’s already clear he plans on running the organization differently than his predecessors. And that includes roaming Columbus' arena seeking out fan interaction, writes @aportzline.https://t.co/WONDAvCcfa pic.twitter.com/rjN5mLXHjZ — The Athletic NHL (@TheAthleticNHL) October 24, 2024  “I had no idea, really, what was going on around the league,” Waddell said. “We were in playoff mode, just going day by day and pretty focused on what was in front of us. “I didn’t know what Columbus was doing (with their GM search). I had permission on Sunday to talk with other teams, and I found out they were still looking. They asked me to come in and talk to them.” Waddell had developed a two-decade friendship with Blue Jackets president of business operations Mike Priest, who was running the Jackets’ GM search. He immediately shot to the top of Priest’s list of candidates, and a drawn-out process started moving forward quickly. He was hired on May 29. Priest and Waddell had been friends for more than two decades after meeting at the NHL board of governors meetings in the early 2000s, when they were both trying to get expansion franchises off the ground in non-traditional hockey markets. Never fear, Green Lantern is here!@BlueJacketsNHL GM Don Waddell went all out for Halloween this year 🎃#CBJ pic.twitter.com/bhLVUKqQTV — FanDuel Sports Network Columbus (@FanDuelSN_CBUS) November 1, 2024  That relationship with Priest was a big draw, Waddell said. So was the Blue Jackets’ young talent, especially at forward. But he was also delighted with the way the franchise operates internally. Under Dundon, the Hurricanes are known to be run more collaboratively than most pro sports franchises. That’s probably a nice way of putting it. There’s a perception that the office staff can’t order paper clips or printer ink without some level of discussion. Advertisement “A lot was done by committee,” Waddell said. “At the end of the day, though, I can honestly say, there’s nothing that I wanted to do … for the most part … nothing major … that we couldn’t get done. “But you had a lot of … how should I put this? … there were always a lot of questions about anything you wanted to do.” It’s hard to argue with the Hurricanes’ results. They’ve won division titles in three of the last four years, and they currently lead the Metropolitan Division. But Waddell seems refreshed by the setup in Columbus. “My day-to-day contact is Mike Priest,” he said. “I keep him updated on anything that’s going on, and he’s been very supportive. Anything we’ve wanted to do — whether it’s picking guys up off waivers, signing guys as free agents — he’s been very supportive. I’m a firm believer that ownership has the right to know what’s going on before they read about it. “I’d say this about Carolina and now in Columbus, though. It’s not the Don Waddell show. We have a lot of really good hockey people here in this organization who have big roles with us. Big decisions have to be made, and you want people around you whose opinions you trust. I had that there, and I have that here.” Waddell has been watching closely every aspect of the Blue Jackets organization. He has his coach in place after hiring Dean Evason a month into his Columbus tenure. Now, as his first season unfolds, he’s watching the roster closely, admiring the young talent and trying to figure out which veterans will be part of the mix going forward. This may take some time, but that’s not because Waddell plans to slow-roll it. To the contrary. “I like a lot of the young guys,” Waddell said. “We hope they continue to grow. It’s an important year for them to keep maturing, not only as players but as people. If they do that, we’re in pretty good shape for the future. Advertisement “Saying that, we’re going to have to add some more pieces next summer; we know that. Going into next summer, we’re going to have lots of cap space. We’re not going to waste it, we’re going to spend it wisely. We’ve already started talking about what areas we need to identify.” Waddell wasn’t out of work long, but he believes he’s landed well. He’s knee-deep in another project, trying to get the Blue Jackets to achieve the same sustained success as the Hurricanes, but perhaps with more postseason success. “I was really excited by the opportunity here right from the moment I heard from the Blue Jackets, honestly,” Waddell said. “And it’s been everything I’d hoped and more. The city is great. The fans have been great. The players have played hard almost every night. “We’ve been through some stuff, some rough patches (on the ice). But I really love it here. It’s been a perfect fit.” (Photo of Don Waddell at the 2024 NHL Draft: Bruce Bennett / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Sign up here to receive it directly in your inbox. Just when you think you’ve got the NFL figured out, Nick Chubb and the newly 3-8 Browns stun Pittsburgh 24-19 in last night’s thrilling, snowy game. After falling to 8-3, Steelers WR George Pickens said, “The conditions played a huge, huge part in today’s game. I don’t really think the Browns are a good team at all.” Both teams played in the same conditions, George. Full takeaways here. On November 23, 2014, the Giants called for a deep shot. Rookie WR Odell Beckham Jr. was to make an out-and-up move down the sideline, with instructions to sell a comeback route in order to help hold the safety. The play began with a misunderstanding. While lining up, Beckham had been told “don’t rush the route,” but only heard “rush the route.” He indeed rushed, failing to sell the comeback and allowing the Cowboys’ corner to remain in tight coverage. The play ended after Eli Manning, seeing the one-on-one look he wanted, targeted Beckham deep. It led to a pass interference call and this unforgettable, three-fingered, 43-yard touchdown catch:  It instantly made Beckham a legend, even inspiring the following year’s Madden cover. But it’s a catch that hasn’t been topped since, by Beckham or any other receiver. And the remainder of his career has never reached those heights again, either. How could it? Today, Jeff Zrebiec delivers the worth-the-wait story behind the catch and Beckham’s later regrets for a moment he would come to call “bittersweet.” Honestly, we spent most of today’s episode of the “Scoop City” podcast talking about our exclusive reporting on the Jets. But since we’ve done plenty on the Jets in this newsletter already this week, let’s go into the weekend on a more positive note. My co-host, Chase Daniel, and I discussed the turnaround of embattled Panthers QB Bryce Young amid Carolina’s two-game winning streak. Advertisement Dianna: I enjoy seeing this improvement. I like watching Bryce Young look so happy — he seems like he’s growing into all of this. Chase: Yeah. It’s wild to me how a benching like that can just change his perspective. Just like a little bit of time in time out. I don’t know what the hell they’re going to do with Bryce Young in the offseason. Dianna: I think they’re still trying to figure out what they want to do. I give (coach Dave Canales) credit for having the guts to walk into David Tepper’s office with GM Dan Morgan and say, I can’t make this work if we want to win games. Bryce Young is not the answer, he needs to watch. And I think he watched Andy Dalton, and I think that helped. Chase: The free agency class, the draft class are not good. Wait another year with Young — if you’re shown enough promise, that’s what you do. If not, then I think you just got to blow it up and get a guy for $10 million a year to play quarterback, to just win some games and hold the fort down. I don’t know if just drafting a guy to draft a guy, like Shedeur Sanders or Cam Ward or Quinn Ewers, I don’t know if they’re better than Young — we forget that Young was a frickin’ No. 1 overall pick. It’s in there somewhere. 🎧 Listen to the full Scoop City Podcast here. Back to you, Jacob. Every Friday, I share three stories from The Athletic that you might have missed. All offer deeper looks into the lives of players and coaches we watch on Sunday. The 24-year-old superstar receiver had started 45 regular season games prior to this season, and his 3,717 receiving yards in that span ranked ahead of names like A.J. Green, Tyreek Hill and Calvin Johnson. Yet even after that all-time great start, Paul Dehner Jr. details how Chase unlocked another level to become this season’s triple-crown leader in receptions (66), yards (981) and touchdowns (10). Yesterday, Colorado’s Travis Hunter confirmed he’ll enter the 2025 NFL draft. The Heisman Trophy favorite is expected to fetch the No. 1 pick. Once drafted, Hunter intends to become football’s Shohei Ohtani by playing both cornerback and receiver. Grace Raynor shares the early days of Hunter’s unprecedented journey. “Inspiring. Great story for starting my day,” said one reader of Doug Haller’s profile on James Conner, which offers a fascinating look at how Conner’s leadership has fueled the Cardinals 6-4 start. The cancer survivor has his team — which finished 4-12 last year — first in the ultra-competitive NFC West, a division they haven’t won since Bruce Arians’ 2015 team. Sunday at 1 p.m. ET Sunday at 4:05 and 4:25 p.m. Sunday at 8:20 p.m. Monday at 8:15 p.m. Yesterday’s most-clicked: Vic Tafur picks all the weekend’s games. Enjoy! 📫 Enjoyed this read?

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Premier League clubs have changed associated party transaction rules. Here’s what it means,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940146/2024/11/22/premier-league-apt-changes-explained/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:43:51 GMT","Amendments to APT rules gained the necessary support to be signed off on Friday morning, with Premier League clubs voting 16-4 in favour","This article, first published on October 14, has been updated to reflect the passing of the changes to the associated party transaction rules on November 22 The vote came swiftly and for the embattled Premier League, there was relief. Changes to the associated party transaction (APT) rules gained the necessary support to be signed off on Friday morning, with clubs voting 16-4 in favour of amendments deemed necessary by Manchester City’s legal challenge this summer. Friday’s meeting began at 9.05am, and by 9.23am a statement had been released. Advertisement Only Aston Villa, Newcastle United and Nottingham Forest joined City in opposing the Premier League’s proposals at a shareholders meeting in central London. But there was a lack of further resistance, with previous sceptics Wolverhampton Wanders and Everton choosing not to join the rebellion, which has given the green light to a revised set of APT rules. Most notably, it will see shareholder loans, previously exempt under the old system, integrated into the APT rules and, by extension, be included in future profit and sustainability rules (PSR) calculations. City, who had pushed for this vote to be delayed, will retain their belief that the Premier League’s APT rules are flawed, but the short-term will now bring modification rather than overhaul. The Athletic analyses where the changes to shareholder loans will leave the Premier League’s 20 clubs. They do exactly what it says on the tin: it is money loaned to a club by their shareholders. They amount to a form of funding, a means for owners to inject cash into the football project without seeking equity in return. Typically these are long-term arrangements, often free of interest payments. And clubs are certainly fond of them. Fourteen of the 20 Premier League teams in the 2022-23 season had shareholder loans recorded in their most recent set of accounts. City’s legal team were only too happy to highlight the extent of their use during this case. It was cited that £1.5billion ($1.96bn) out of £4bn total borrowings across the division — 37 per cent — were through shareholder loans. “The main motivation (behind shareholder loans) is that it’s an easier mechanism for an owner getting their money back,” says Chris Weatherspoon, an accountant and financial analyst at the football website Game State. “If they put in equity, that’s them effectively giving up any right to a return, short of paying out dividends, which hardly any club does or even can do, as most are in a position of accumulated deficits, or making their money back when they sell up. Advertisement “It’s also more tax efficient. Interest costs on debt — if owners charge them — are tax-deductible for clubs, so reduce the club’s tax burden; dividend payments aren’t. “Another point is that if there’s a need to plug a cash-flow gap quickly, lending money is easier than working through the mechanism of issuing shares.” The Premier League, until this point, had excluded shareholder loans from APT rules, saying they would “encourage investment” in clubs. City came hard at the Premier League when launching their legal challenge in June, saying the APT rules in place were “discriminatory and distortive”. They also called their existence “unlawful” and set about picking holes in a set of regulations designed to prevent clubs from earning increased revenue through inflated commercial deals. In 2021, 19 of the 20 members, City included, had been responsible for voting through the existing APT rules in 2021, with only Newcastle United abstaining. Everything, in theory, had to reflect fair market value (FMV). Only, shareholder loans have never done that. No bank would lend hundreds of millions interest-free, so why should a club benefit from such an arrangement through its owners? It was, City argued, the very definition of an associated party transaction and “at odds with the whole rationale of PSR (the league’s profit and sustainability rules)”. “The exclusion of shareholder loans from the APT rules distorts competition in permitting one form of subsidy, namely a non-commercial loan but not another, namely a non-commercial sponsorship agreement,” City were cited as saying in the verdict. And, most importantly, City’s argument over shareholder loans was accepted by the independent panel. Any money loaned to a club by their owners will need to reflect FMV and see interest rates charged in line with commercial loans. The changes will bring the Premier League in line with UEFA, European football’s governing body, which applies FMV to shareholder loans in its financial fair play (FFP) calculations. Three clubs lead by some distance: Everton, Brighton & Hove Albion and Arsenal. Collectively, those three had £1.08billion of debt owed in shareholder loans recorded in their 2022-23 accounts. Everton’s profligacy during the reign of Farhad Moshiri sees them top the list with £451million borrowed in interest-free loans from the Iran-born businessman, a sum expected to be written off if The Friedkin Group completes its looming takeover of the club. Brighton come next with £373million owed to Tony Bloom, their long-standing owner, in another interest-free arrangement. That outstanding sum had been trimmed thanks to a £33m repayment during the 2022-23 season but had previously increased every year since 2013. Arsenal’s shareholder borrowings are much more recent. A refinancing of existing debt in 2020 saw them draw down a loan from parent company Kroenke Sports & Entertainment and, as of the 2022-23 accounts, that sum now stands at £259million. The precise rates of interest on that shareholder loan have not been disclosed, but Arsenal’s last two sets of accounts showed interest paid on total debts (including £10.2m worth of debentures) to be £4.3m. That is less than half the interest Arsenal had previously paid when holding external debt. Advertisement Chelsea (£146million), Liverpool (£137m) Leicester City (£132m) and Bournemouth (£115m) are also north of £100m in shareholder loans. Still, Leicester’s figure has been markedly reduced after £194m of loans to King Power International Co Limited, the club’s parent company, got capitalised into equity in February last year. ﻿ It will not be a concern to half a dozen sides, including City, Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle and Manchester United, who held no shareholder loans when filing their most recent set of accounts. The Premier League were obliged to address the legal shortcomings of their APT rules and say the revised framework will ensure “appropriate parity between the treatment of shareholder loans and other APTs going forward”. The 14 clubs currently benefitting from shareholder loans now have a decision to make. The simplest solution is to replace those soft loans through a conversion to equity and the Premier League has provided a 50-day grace period for that to happen. Take this approach before January 11 and the matter will end there. Any shareholder loans still in place after that cut-off point, though, “must be submitted as an APT” and be subject to an FMV assessment. That will mean money borrowed from owners can be retained on its existing terms but adjustments will need to be made to this season’s accounts. An interest-free loan, for example, must now see FMV interest payments added to PSR calculations. Going on the Bank of England’s current rate of 4.75 per cent, that would mean £4.75million would need to be included for every £100m borrowed in shareholder loans. The Premier League made two distinctions in how shareholder loans will be judged: pre- and post-December 14, 2021. That was the point that the APT rules challenged by Manchester City were introduced but the Premier League board will need to determine in both instances whether the borrowing was at FMV. Advertisement Most importantly, though, there will be no retrospective assessment of shareholder loans. That ensures clubs such as Everton, who benefitted from enormous interest-free funding from outgoing owner Farhad Moshiri, while sailing close to the PSR wind, are set to escape further scrutiny. None of that is to say this thorny issue has met a neat resolution. “In no way will this be the end of the matter,” says Yasin Patel, leading sports barrister at Church Court Chambers. “Instead, it highlights a number of factors: not all of the Premier League clubs are unified in one way or another in relation to the rules. Nor will this be the end of the storm. “City have threatened further legal action prior to today’s judgment. This is now almost inevitable. City have argued that the APT Rules discriminate against clubs like themselves. They have always argued that not subjecting previous shareholder loans to a fair market value assessment would be unfair, particularly as this is applied to previous sponsorship deals. “The case between the Premier League, where 115 charges are being fought, continues in the background. But this saga has several other plots and expect City to add a further one with new litigation.“ Speaking at the time of the tribunal verdict being published, Simon Leaf, a partner and sports law specialist at Mishcon de Reya, also had his misgivings that the issue could be easily resolved. “On the one hand, whilst the Premier League may try to carry on with the existing rules and rely on what is commonly known in the legal world as the ‘blue pencil test’, where essentially they would argue that the rules should be read so that they are automatically reinterpreted in a lawful way, it would appear that Manchester City would challenge this strongly,” says Leaf. “City would, no doubt, try to argue that until formal changes to the rules are voted on and agreed by the other Premier League clubs, the APT rules are unlawful and therefore cannot be enforced. Advertisement “In my view, City may even try to suggest that the APT rules can only now work if the shareholder loan calculation applies retrospectively — which again, is likely to be problematic for the Premier League because several clubs are likely to oppose this, and may even try to challenge such a rule change themselves.” It is worth remembering that City believe all APT rules were declared null and void by the original tribunal. The amendments voted through by the 16 clubs will not alter that outlook. (Top photo: Ashley Allen/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Ruben Amorim, the Right One? Man Utd head coach mixes warmth with steel in first press conference",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940596/2024/11/22/ruben-amorim-manchester-united-press-conference/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:43:44 GMT",The Portuguese referenced the club's past but made it clear he has a vision for what his Manchester United team will look like in the future,"EPL For all the humility and warmth exuded by Ruben Amorim in his first press conference as Manchester United head coach, there was a clear message of strength to players and fans. “As a coach, you have to choose one way or another: I choose always 100 per cent our way,” he said when asked about his preference for his 3-4-2-1 formation. “I choose to risk, no doubts. I believe so much in our way of playing; they will believe too. There is no second way. Advertisement “We will adapt some players because this team was built for a different system. The principles are the same. “On Sunday, you will see the list of players, and maybe think not a lot of change, but you will see it in the positioning or the way they feel the ball.” Such clarity of thought has been communicated to players during initial training sessions this week. According to people close to the squad — speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships — Amorim’s instructions have been short and direct. He does not want to overcomplicate things to start, but he does want to instil an idea.  He acknowledged changing the system midway through the season might cause some turbulence, but he has a positive mindset that he hopes will transmit to the players. “I don’t know about repair, I feel we have space to grow,” he said. “I know it is a way of playing we are changing in the middle of the season. We have to improve the physical aspect of the team. I don’t know how long it will take. I know when in Manchester United you have to win games. “I am a little bit of a dreamer: I believe in myself, I also believe in the club, I believe in my mindset, that can help. I truly believe in the players also. The only thing I ask is hard work and that you believe in a new idea. I felt that. Until they prove me wrong, I believe in the players.” There, in that final sentence, was the steel that people who have worked with him say he possesses. It sounded like a warning shot to players, those who fail to commit themselves will face the consequences. GO DEEPER Manchester United lead the way in promoting homegrown talent. Will it continue? There were echoes of Jose Mourinho, who in his early days in England nicely meshed humour with a hard edge. Inevitably, Mourinho came up during the press conference. Amorim revealed the manager he studied under at Carrington during an internship six years ago had messaged him after his appointment at United. But while Mourinho called himself a Special One, Amorim preferred a modest moniker. He settled for the Right One. Advertisement “First thing, not just on me but all the Portuguese coaches, he showed we can be the best in the world, from a small country,” Amorim said. “But I am different from Mourinho. He was European champion and I am not. Football these days is different, and I think I am the right person for this moment.” Amorim also talked about how his age, at 39 years old, can help him communicate with a squad of young men. In Mourinho’s time, he said, those players were Frank Lampard and John Terry. “These days are different,” he added, seeming to suggest a self-managing dressing room is harder to find. He was smart in referencing those who have come before him, having the double effect of paying homage while also reminding us that many different types have failed, so he should be given time. There was also a nod to his current paymasters. “You have here different types of coaches, the guys that won everything like (Louis) van Gaal and Mourinho, the new ones that knew the club inside out like (Ole Gunnar) Solskjaer, then one of the best outside the top-five leagues in (Erik) Ten Hag. You have different coaches, the same results. We will try to do INEOS way, my way.” So not impossible, came the question. “No, of course not. Call me naive but I truly believe I am the right guy in the right moment.” There it was again. That sense of momentum was felt by staff during greetings at Old Trafford in his first week in England. He showed genuine enjoyment in touring the museum and talked to people about the heritage of the club. He and the football executive want to forge a new history, though, and there were more signs in his first public address of how he will do that. GO DEEPER The Premier League returns: Guardiola's contract, Amorim's arrival and could Chelsea be title challengers? “I think we lose the ball too often, we have to be better at running back, I think that is clear to everyone,” he said, raising a smile in the room. “I think we have to be better on the details. In the small things, I think I can help a lot.” It was no coincidence that footage from one of Amorim’s first sessions showed him urging the players to sprint back into position after losing the ball. Advertisement Those clips also painted a picture of how Amorim plans to shape United. His trademark 3-4-2-1 system was clear, with Leny Yoro, Jonny Evans and Luke Shaw making up the back three from right to left. Antony was the right wing-back, with Tyrell Malacia on the other flank, either side of Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo in midfield. Amad and Mason Mount occupied the two No 10 positions, behind Marcus Rashford up top. At Sporting CP in the Portuguese Primeira Liga this season, Amorim has played a left-footer at right wing-back in 17-year-old Geovany Quenda, but at United the other candidates for that role are right-footed. It would be a major call to start Antony in the Premier League, especially if it means a defensively-minded wing-back on the opposite side at the expense of Alejandro Garnacho. How Amorim fits Garnacho into the team will be fascinating to observe. The new head coach must assess whether the 20-year-old is willing to embrace a wing-back position or his suitability to operate in the tighter confines of a No 10 role. Bruno Fernandes is expected to partner Amad in that line of attack. GO DEEPER How can Amorim get the best out of Garnacho at Man Utd? Amorim pulling Mainoo for instructions during the session, and then allowing that section of video to go public, suggests he is a player who will feature heavily. Amorim appeared to be reinforcing to Mainoo how to find space and fire the ball forward to the No 10s — who are central to his methodology. The two deeper midfielders can be classed as No 8s, although one is typically more disciplined than the other. Manuel Ugarte seems a sure fit as the sitter, having played under Amorim at Sporting from 2021 to 2023. Rashford as a striker would be an interesting alternative to Rasmus Hojlund, given Joshua Zirkzee does not exactly match Amorim’s prototype in that position. Amorim insisted the players are ready to adapt. “In this first moment, they just want to play, it is easy, in the future we will see,” he said. “You can watch on TV but you have to train with them to see if they can play in different positions. Everyone wants to play now; if they have the opportunity to play as a goalkeeper, they will.” It was a nice line, another that raised a laugh. Advertisement In the windows to come, Amorim may be able to buy players that tesselate with his approach more closely. He was not as sure-footed on recruitment as he was elsewhere, but then again he is entering a new structure which is not yet settled itself. “I think it has to be all together because if you are a coach coming here and already chose the players, you could be wrong because the club will be here for a long time and you as a coach, you don’t know that,” he said. “We have to improve the process of recruitment, the data. I think it is all together, but the final word should be the manager, not because it is your right but because it is your responsibility. I have to understand the league and then when everything is aligned, everyone is on the same page, we can buy and sell players.” (Top photo: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

That gets an A-grade from us thanks to playing at a much stronger pace than we figured given how weak their wingers looked to start the season. That the Golden Knights have survived lately with Mark Stone missing time (something we all assumed would happen at some point), makes it even more impressive. Pavel Dorofeyev, by the way, is on pace for 41 goals. That unexpected leap certainly helps! Last week: 12

The “D” stands for “deja vu.” Advertisement Will the Oilers be better going forward? Probably. They should still be able to challenge for the Pacific Division title despite their tepid start. But we expected a whole lot better from the team many expected to be the league’s absolute best going into the season.

Dom grade: D+ With five minutes left against Detroit Thursday night, the Islanders were up 1-0. Five minutes later they went home empty-handed with not even a beloved loser point to hold on to. It was yet another missed opportunity for an Islanders team that’s been on the wrong side of mid this season. We thought this would be a 95-point team, not an 85-point one — and they’re not even on pace for that. Advertisement The Islanders are dealing with a lot of injuries so they get a slight pass for that. But this is how you re-pay us for actually believing in you guys? The good news? The rest of the Eastern playoff hopefuls look just as bad right now, so the Islanders haven’t technically lost much ground yet. Brutal, brutal loss to end the road trip for #Isles. Sixth time this season they’ve allowed a tying/go-ahead goal inside of 5 minutes to go in the 3rd.

Dom grade: F- The Bruins looked a lot better (on the power play anyway) in their first game under Joe Sacco, but there’s a lot of damage that still needs to be undone. It’s not like we expected the Bruins to be world beaters by any means, but what they’ve shown so far has been nothing short of pathetic. It was difficult to watch Jim Montgomery try to coax a weak and flawed roster into looking like a contender and he ultimately paid the price for the sins of Don Sweeney. Maybe Sacco presses the right buttons to get the team back on track — it’s not like the rest of the East poses much of a threat — but it’ll take a helluva turnaround. When a team with playoff aspirations has to fire their coach because they’re tied for second last in goal differential with the San Jose Sharks, an F-minus is the only fair grade that can be given.

Dom grade: C How you feel about the Red Wings’ start depends a lot on how you felt about the Red Wings to start. The Model viewed them as an 81-point team and at 8-9-2 they are pretty much exactly what they were expected to be. But damn is it still disappointing to see it actually happen in practice. Moritz Seider looks great, Simon Edvinsson might be the real deal, and the goaltending has been actually solid. And yet the team still stinks. It’s possible that Thursday’s comeback regulation win over the Islanders can serve as a turning point, but it’s still been an ugly, ugly start. The Red Wings just don’t look good enough.

To Ottawa’s credit, the team’s underlying numbers are indeed much improved and it is tragically ironic that the team’s major offseason fix is currently the biggest problem. If Linus Ullmark looks like Linus Ullmark more often, the Senators might be fine. But he hasn’t and so here we are. The strong xG might mean they earn a better grade in Q2.

But even with those losses on the back end, Utah should be better than what they’ve shown over the last month. The team’s offense has felt anemic most nights and Connor Ingram has been a shade of himself between the pipes.

In other words — Q1 could not have gone better. The Flyers look better positioned for a high pick thanks to their weak start which should get their rebuild back on track. On top of that, all the players the team needs to look good are looking great right now.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Ruben Amorim live updates: Manchester United manager’s first press conference ahead of Ipswich game,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/ruben-amorim-live-updates-manchester-united-press-conference-today/6Kx2t7p2gFKf/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 14:56:45 GMT",Follow live coverage of Amorim's first press conference as Manchester United boss as he previews Sunday’s Premier League game against Ipswich,"live Updated 9h ago Ruben Amorim faced the press for the first time as Manchester United head coach today after taking over from Erik ten Hag. The 39-year-old cut a confident figure as he smiled throughout his first pre-match press conference, being asked about Jose Mourinho, his playing style and his influence on the club's recruitment, among other things. On Sunday, he will take charge of his first Premier League match as his side face Ipswich Town away from home at 4:30pm GMT/11:30am ET — the match will be covered live on The Athletic. Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here. With his first press conference under his belt, Ruben Amorim will now be turning his full attention towards Sunday afternoon's visit to Ipswich. It is in the primetime slot (4:30pm GMT/11:30am ET) and will be covered live here on The Athletic — here is the full Premier League schedule this weekend. Saturday Sunday Monday Advertisement With so much to ask Amorim in such a short time period, there were no questions on the injured players in the Manchester United squad. Although, it is worth staying tuned to The Athletic between now and Sunday for updates on the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire who will all hope to play a role against Ipswich. One of Amorim's more interesting answers came after he was asked whether the United role is one of football's impossible jobs. The new man outlined each of the post-Ferguson managers (bar David Moyes) and what they brought to the club, before saying ""You have different coaches, the same results. We will try to do Ineos way, my way."" It's far too early to say whether Amorim will be a success at United. But you do get the sense he's not going to compromise on his ideals this season. Amorim cut a relaxed and confident figure in his first press conference.  The 39-year-old was asked multiple questions about his compatriot Jose Mourinho, but was keen to stress he is his own man. ""I am a different guy."" was one of his more repeated phrases. Fans will find it hard not to nod along as Amorim outlined his belief in the squad and the things needed to improve. United's new head coach brought up his age, and how it might help him relate to a new generation of players. He also brought up how his club need to improve their physicality and get better at tracking back. That's all from Ruben Amorim in his first press conference as Manchester United head coach. And we want to hear your thoughts. Let us know what you thought to Amorim's first meeting with the media by emailing us at livebloguk@theathletic.com. Amorim was very clear in his response when asked whether he will look to implement his playing style immediately at United. ""As a coach you have to choose one way or another, I choose always 100 percent our way. ""I choose to risk a bit. I believe so much in our way of playing, they will believe too. There is no second way. ""We will adapt some players because we don’t have a different profile. Maybe on Sunday you will see the starting 11 and not feel a lot of change but you will see it in the game and the positioning or where they receive the ball."" Advertisement Amorim was asked how important it is to rebuild the belief within a group of players who have gotten used to disappointment this season. ""That is for sure but it is normal when players don’t win games, you start to be suspicious of the way of playing. You can understand when they walk to the game or the warm up, you can understand if they are confident or not. ""I think they have to help them but they are ready to cope with the demands of games in the Premier League. You see sometimes they have a bad first half and then second half they will change, so they have to find that mindset."" Amorim's clear belief in his abilities comes through loud and clear, even if there is humility also. He acknowledges that changing formation midway through a season is a risk, but he is 100 per cent confident in his methods. The players may be similar on Sunday against Ipswich, but their positions will change, he says. Whether some of these players can adapt remains to be seen, but he is adamant they all want to get on the pitch anywhere right now — even as goalkeeper. I asked Amorim if the players are open to playing in different positions to the ones they played in under Ten Hag. ""They want to play. In this first moment, they just want to play, so it is easy. ""In the future, we will see. You can watch on TV but you have to train with them to see if they can play in different positions. Everyone wants to play now, if they have the opportunity to play as a goalkeeper, they will. They are open to change some positions. No manager has lasted three full seasons yet at United since Sir Alex Ferguson left, but Amorim feels two and a half years — the length of his contract — is enough to know if he's the right man for the job. ""I have two years and a half of contract. I think two years you can understand if I am the right manager to go in this process. ""We will need more time, if you look to the other clubs who are winning this league, they are doing this process for a long time. But they are winning, that's why they time to do their project. ""I understand we will need more than two and a half years, we have to win something, somewhere but in two years you can understand if you want to continue on this path or change. We'll see how long it will take."" A trickier question followed for Amorim, one hooked on his belief in the same group of players who 'got Ten Hag sacked'. ""It is belief, you have to believe and I believe in them. When I started this week, you can say one week three training (sessions) but they are open to different things.  ""The only thing I ask is hard work and you have to believe in the new idea and I felt that. Until they prove me wrong, I believe in the players."" Advertisement The old favourite 'impossible job' was then brought up before Amorim was asked what he views as his biggest challenge. ""I really don’t know the biggest challenge, I will found out during these months. ""You had here different types of coaches; the guys that won everything like Van Gaal and Mourinho, the new ones that knew the club inside out like Solskjaer then one of the best outside the top five leagues in Ten Hag. We have to improve as a club and acknowledge we need time, every coach needs time and we have to win games. ""You have different coaches, the same results. We will try to do our way, the INEOS way and my way."" Asked again if it was the impossible job, he said: ""No, of course not. I believe that. ""Call me naïve but I believe I am the right guy in the right moment. I could be wrong but the earth will still turn so I'm not worried about that. I truly believe I am the right guy."" United fans have been curious to know of the difference between Amorim being a head coach rather than a manager. The new United man is not thought to have the same level of input on player trading as his predecessors, and will share duties with Dan Ashworth, Jason Wilcox and others. However, don't think players will arrive at the club without his say so. That was clear from his answer to the last question, particularly where he said he has a ""great responsibility"" when choosing players. A key question on recruitment was the next one that Amorim faced. ""I think it has to be all together because if you are a coach coming here and already chose the players, you could be wrong because the club will be here for a long time and you as a coach, you don’t know that. ""We have to improve the process of recruitment; the data and the profile of the players we want. I have to have a strong position on that because I'm the coach. I think it is all together, but the final word should be the manager, not because it is your right but because it is your responsibility. ""I have to understand the league — that is important — and then when everything is aligned, everyone is on the same page, we can buy and sell players."" Amorim has repeated a couple of times how he feels he is the right man in the right moment for United. He acknowledges that unlike Jose Mourinho, his compatriot who he worked under during an internship at United, he does not arrive as a European champion — but he has a clear idea for how his team will play, even if that means some adaptation from players. Another question about Mourinho, this time on his start to life in England with his famous 'special one' press conference. ""First thing, not just on me but all the Portuguese coaches, he showed we can be the best in the world from a small country. But I am different from Mourinho.  ""You look at Mourinho and felt he could win everywhere, he was European champion and I am not. I'm a different guy in a different moment. Football nowadays is different and I think I am the right person for this moment, because I am a young guy, I understand the players. ""Mourinho at Chelsea, the young guys were like Lampard and nowadays is so much different."" Advertisement The new United head coach was asked where he can make some easy wins in improving the team from the one that has struggled this season. ""In simple things, I think, if you want to speak about the team and the way we play, I think we lose the ball too often, we have to be better at running back, I think that is clear for everyone and I think we have to be very good on the details. ""Sometimes we are hoping to change big things, but I think it is the small things. We have to improve on the small things. In the small things, I think I can help these players a lot."" Amorim was then asked if he had heard from Jose Mourinho after taking the job. ""He sent me a message, he told me that it's a lovely club, a big club with lovely people. In that he is correct, it still is. ""But a lot of things change, we are in a different building now, we are building a new one. I am a different guy and I hope to teach something to my players. ""The club is still big, it is still the best club in England and we want to win. That's all."" Asked about his ideas regarding playing style, Amorim gave a thoughtful response. ""It is not revolution. Football is not so different with five players at the back, three players at the back or four players at the back. ""I cannot see (it will be) evolution, we have to wait and see. But we will play a different type of football. We have our ideas. I'm not saying they're the best ideas but it is our way of seeing football. ""It's not revolution or evolution, it's change."""

I'm still uncertain the team will have the pace to best Ferrari and McLaren, which are definitely in the ballpark at the front. Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez didn't go for a soft tire run in FP2, meaning it's hard to say where Red Bull stacks up in the competitive picture. But watching Verstappen's onboard, he really didn't seem comfortable with the balance of the car. The Austin upgrade was intended to help improve the connection he felt between the car and the road, and while there has been progress, today wasn't the most ringing endorsement of a step forward. For F1, there'll be positivity that Thursday went by without a hitch for its sessions. I am curious about the lack of fans in the main grandstand, though.

Despite a poor lap that left him in the bottom five, he's come back out on medium tires for the remaining running in FP2.  Alex Albon's car has been removed from the track and the drivers are free to resume running.  Alex Albon, whose car was being worked on for an issue with its fuel system about 10 minutes ago, has stopped out on track, causing a red flag.

FP1 saw significant track evolution as more rubber was laid down, I expect we'll see more of the same here.  Both George Russell and Sergio Perez come on their radios to report that their helmets are allowing too much venting, allowing too much cold air to come in. The air temperature at the moment is 47 degrees Fahrenheit.  Sixteen of the 20 drivers are out on the track in the first five minutes of FP2.

With that said, tonight, I am willingly seeing “Gladiator II” on opening night. That’s how excited I am for it. The 76ers are really in trouble, everyone The story of the week has been the 76ers’ disastrous start to this season. Joel Embiid has played in four games, but they haven’t won any of them. Paul George has played in eight games, yet Philly is 1-7 in those – likewise for Tyrese Maxey. Overall, the Sixers are 2-12. That’s the worst record in the league. Entering the season, they had the league’s eighth-best championship odds. They also have the worst offense in the NBA, George just hyperextended his knee for the second time in about a month and there was a team meeting that immediately got leaked to the media. Advertisement The Sixers are a trainwreck right now. The information from the team meeting following a big loss to the Heat wasn’t all that damning, really. Maxey told his good friend Embiid he needs to be on time for everything. It sounds like there was good conversation about how players want to be coached and how coaches want the players to approach things. However, the takeaway from the Sixers about this report was wondering how it got leaked. Embiid called whoever leaked it, “a real piece of s—” (perhaps he was quoting). Embiid then kind of played the victim a bit in his comments while sort of taking accountability for what’s going on. PG spoke on his own podcast with teammate Reggie Jackson about all things Sixers and the team meeting. Both of them couldn’t believe the meeting information got out.  You can excuse so much of the lack of success so far with the injuries, and it’s a real reason why they’re bad. But this bad? That can’t be real. They’ve been eviscerated when Embiid, George or Maxey are on the floor. And the trio has only played six minutes together. Rookie Jared McCain has been their best player on the season. On his podcast, PG said this: “To be quite frank, he’s been our most consistent player on the floor so far… We definitely have to step our shit up because he can’t be our most consistent player.” There are two things keeping people from completely burying the Sixers right now. First, I think people still believe that a healthy, in-shape version of this team can be dangerous in a playoff scenario. This team was supposed to contend … for the title, not Cooper Flagg (although their pick is top-six-protected in this lottery). Second, the East is so atrocious that they still have so much time to get into the top six in the conference. They have so much time in general, but the Sixers haven’t shown anything to believe in them yet. Maybe they haven’t had a true chance because of the injuries, but they still need to show us something. Luka Dončić is out with a wrist injury 🏀 Mavs star is out at least a week. Dončić hurt his wrist in the blowout win over New Orleans. He’ll be reevaluated next week. 🏀 What is each team’s biggest concern so far? The Athletic’s NBA staff has the answers. 🫡 Hubie Brown will call one more game. The 91-year-old legend will be scheduled at some point on ESPN this season for one final celebration. Salute to one of the greatest.  Advertisement 🇺🇸🏆 The Celtics go to Washington! They celebrated their championship at the White House. And owner Wyc Grousbeck shed light on when he might be out. 🤕 Cade Cunningham got hurt. In Detroit’s overtime loss in Charlotte, Cunningham took a hard fall in the fourth quarter and appeared to hurt his tailbone.

 We’re not done with the 2-12 Sixers! Because this situation has become so dire, I decided to assemble The Panic Panel! Whenever a situation calls for it, TPP can give us a shot of reality. I decided to phone a friend (or five) to ask them a very simple, yet important question: On a scale of 1-10, how f— are the 76ers and why? Jason Concepcion | Writer, podcaster and Knicks fan: I have it at 7 and mounting. Why not higher? It’s early in the season, Embiid and PG certainly could start playing better, and McCain is a bright spot. That said, what we’re witnessing is a basketball coup. This is Maxey’s team now. The only way Joel gets it back, is by asserting his dominance by continuing to come in late until HE DECIDES when to come in on time. Ian Karmel | Comedian, podcaster and writer, and Blazers fan: 7. That’s the highest I can give a Philly team while the Cowboys are this bad. Pablo Torre | Podcaster and Process Truster: 8. I think it’s safe to say that the Sixers were significantly more fun when they were trying to lose games on purpose. Mo Dakhil | Writer, podcaster and former NBA video coordinator: 7. It looks like a complete disaster in Philadelphia with all the injuries and the team meeting leaks. That said, if Philly can get healthy, it can go on a run. The Sixers are only four games out of the sixth seed; that’s a good week in the NBA. The challenge is that the turnaround has to begin now, and the margin for error is low. If the Sixers were in the West, this would be a 100 on a scale of 1 to 10. Advertisement Jay King | Celtics beat writer, podcaster and Gerry McNamara fan: Forty? Four hundred? Four billion? They are beyond f—. They are built to win now, with Joel Embiid at 30 and Paul George at 34, and have won two of their first 14 games. Even if Embiid and George work themselves back into top form, which doesn’t feel like a given after their hobbled starts, the supporting cast around them does not appear ready for the big time. The 76ers rank dead last in offense. That means they haven’t scored as much as the Trail Blazers or Wizards. Sure, the injuries have sunk the 76ers, but does anybody trust Embiid and George to both stay healthy? Even Philadelphia’s most promising development, Jared McCain’s immediate readiness, comes with complications. Can a team really defend at a championship level with two 6-foot-3 players in the top four? I haven’t even discussed the locker room, which is already in flames, based on all of the reporting. Though lucky the rest of the Eastern Conference is also in shambles, the 76ers are headed nowhere good. Magic end Lakers’ six-game win streak The Lakers were up four points with 27 seconds left in the game after Anthony Davis split two free throws. Then, Franz Wagner hit a layup, and the Magic played the foul game again. They were just desperate to find a win on the second night of a back-to-back in L.A. after the Clippers ended their six-game win streak the night before. Davis then missed both free throws with 18 seconds left, setting the stage for Wagner to be the hero. He put on his cape and knocked down a 3-pointer with 2.1 seconds left to put the Magic up 119-118. The Lakers inbounded to AD, who then missed a turnaround 18-footer by a lot. Wagner had 37 points, 11 assists, six rebounds and four steals and outdueled LeBron James in the fourth. He’s been playing out of his mind lately, as the Magic have won seven of eight. LeBron and AD combined for 70 points and 19 rebounds. Hornets 123 (6-9), Pistons 121 (7-10) in OT: The Hornets and Pistons only play close, tense games apparently. Earlier this season, Brandon Miller got a tip-in at the buzzer to beat Detroit. Charlotte needed him to take over in this one, and he did. Miller scored eight of his 38 points in overtime, after LaMelo Ball fouled out literally one second into the extra period. Ball had 35 points and nine assists. The most impressive part of this game from Miller was definitely snatching the transition lob.  Raptors 110 (4-12), Wolves 105 (8-7): The biggest takeaway from this game on the internet will be the Julius Randle-Rudy Gobert-Anthony Edwards moment. And it was a pretty hilarious/dramatic moment. My takeaway is this Raptors team is starting to get healthy, and they are better than their record. Scottie Barnes had 17 points and six assists in his first game back after missing 11 games. RJ Barrett had 31 points and Chris Boucher had 22 off the bench. Everybody’s takeaway should be that this is the only court the Raptors should have:  Spurs 126 (8-8), Jazz 118 (3-12): If you were wondering why the Jazz are one of the worst defensive teams in the league, just go watch the fourth quarter of this game. They gave up 41 points to a Spurs team without Victor Wembanyama. Eight different players scored in double figures for San Antonio, led by Harrison Barnes’ 25 points. Spurs rookie Stephon Castle had another strong game … LeBron James is taking notice. 📫 Love The Bounce? Check out The Athletic’s other newsletters.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Ben White out for 'months' with knee injury: What this means for Arsenal and Mikel Arteta,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5919670/2024/11/22/ben-white-injury-surgery-arsenal/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 14:43:12 GMT","Mikel Arteta has confirmed that Arsenal defender Ben White is going to be out for &#8220;months&#8221; after undergoing a procedure on his knee during the international break.

White played the full game in the 1-1 draw with Chelsea before the break but he has been dealing with multiple issues since the start of the season. Advertisement The 27-year-old has been a virtual ever-present when fit over the past two seasons but he started on the bench against Manchester City in September and then missed the next two fixtures. Jurrien Timber and Thomas Partey have played at right back in his absence and Arteta will now need to call on the duo during a busy festive schedule. “Ben is gonna be out for months, unfortunately,” Arteta said on Friday. “It’s been different kinds of struggles. It’s never been the same thing. We had to make a decision. It’s not been improving in the last few weeks, unfortunately. “We know that Ben is going to push every boundary but it got to a point where we have to protect the player and we decided to do the surgery. He agreed with that and unfortunately, that’s going to keep him out for a few months.” Arteta could not confirm exactly how long White will be missing for. “I don’t know at the moment,” the Spaniard said. “We have to see how he reacts post-surgery. I don’t expect him to be half a year, but I cannot tell you exactly.” White being out for this length of time is a blow for Arsenal, just as it felt they were getting the majority of their squad back fit. The chemistry down the right flank is fundamental to Arsenal’s attacking play and it has already been disrupted by Martin Odegaard’s ankle ligament injury which kept him out for two months. Arteta would have hoped to have his trusted trio — White, Odegaard and Bukayo Saka — available for a prolonged period of time but White’s injury now forces him to recalibrate his thinking. Full-back has been an area in which injuries have dogged Arsenal most often this season with Timber, Calafiori, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Kieran Tierney and Takehiro Tomiyasu all missing games through injury, or the entire season so far in the case of the latter two. Advertisement Timber played at right back in White’s absence and was outstanding in his three Premier League games there, but he has had to deputise at left-back the past month as Calafiori received treatment for a knee injury. But Timber has also suffered a couple of niggles that saw Thomas Partey shifted to right back. The Netherlands international is the most likely to start at right-back against Forest and his more conventional skillset should allow him to support Saka with overlapping runs. Saka has been increasingly doubled up on and against Newcastle he was isolated with the lack of team-mates to drag defenders away from him. Arteta has only named the same full-back combination in back-to-back Premier League matches on three occasions this season. Timber and Calafiori is the only pairing that has played three consecutive games but both offer Arsenal the ability to invert, dribble and attack the final third, arguably giving Arteta his most fluid and flexible mix of full-backs. GO DEEPER After an unusually difficult start, is this the moment Arsenal's season really begins? There was better news on some other fitness doubts, including Leandro Trossard who picked up a hamstring injury on international duty with Belgium, and England duo Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka who stayed at Arsenal after hobbling off against Chelsea. “Trossard seems to be OK,” Arteta added. “He trained this morning and he seems to be feeling good. We will assess everything with the doctor right now. But that’s good. “Bukayo and Declan as well. They had the first partial session today. So, very good as well.” White’s absence may be mitigated with the return of left-back Riccardo Calafiori, who is also fighting to be in contention after missing five games with a knee injury. “Riccy trained today,” he said. “His rehab has gone really well. He was able to do certain things last week with the physios. He trained on the pitch this week, he trained with us today as well. He will be in the squad.” (Photos: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Eze has been absent since sustaining a hamstring problem in the first half of Palace’s 2-1 Carabao Cup victory over Villa on October 30, and was eager to return for the Premier League clash but Glasner has ruled him out of contention. Advertisement There is better news for Palace with Will Hughes returning from suspension after missing the 2-0 defeat by Fulham before the international break after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season. Palace’s players were given the first week of the break off, while those returning from injury trained for the entire fortnight. Cheick Doucoure came through an hour of a behind closed doors under-21 friendly during the international break unscathed and also trained with the under-21 side. Jefferson Lerma is available again after missing the last two games with a hamstring injury. Eddie Nketiah is still out, while there is hope Adam Wharton could return after Palace’s match with Newcastle United next week. GO DEEPER Injuries for Eze and Wharton should not obscure growing signs of a Palace resurgence “Ebs would like to be involved in tomorrow’s game, but I took the decision not to take him with us to Villa,’ Glasner said. “It’s a little bit too risky. He trained during the week, but it’s too near when (the injury) happened. “We have to protect the players. When we see our schedule after the Villa game, with eight games in December, we can’t take any risks. We had a long chat today, because he’s very ambitious. He’s a great guy, he worked really hard and he wanted to be with us. “He feels he’s ready, and it’s him who wants to play. I want him to play but we have to protect him. Yes we lose him for one game, but we win eight or nine days. Maybe then we win eight games, and we all hope to win at the Emirates in the Carabao Cup. “We have 15 games in December and January, and we need him for 15 games, not just one.” Glasner confirmed he has held discussions with chairman Steve Parish and sporting director Dougie Freedman about the January transfer window, and says he would like to increase the number of players at his disposal. The manager took the decision to limit his squad to 20 senior outfield players, which has been further depleted by injuries, but is now looking to add reinforcements. “We talked before (the break), about the plan for January. We found an agreement and talked about it. But the most important thing is to realise it.” “We go with 17 outfield players and three under-21s, it would not be a good idea to sell and not bring anyone in.” GO DEEPER Stormzy, Wilfried Zaha and the Crystal Palace connection: Inside the rise of AFC Croydon Athletic (Warren Little/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Sharks stock report: Who's up and who's down through 22 games?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940005/2024/11/22/sharks-nhl-stock-up-stock-down/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 13:56:31 GMT",The Sharks are through a quarter of the season. It’s a good time to take stock of individual performances.,"NHL It might not seem like much to go from 5-15-2 to 6-11-5 from one year to the next, but the San Jose Sharks could tell you how it feels different now. In Ryan Warsofsky’s first season as head coach, the Sharks are no NHL big shot. But this revamped club is not the pushover it was on numerous nights last season. The Sharks are still at the bottom of the Pacific Division and on the lowest rung of the 32 teams, but Warsofsky has them in virtually every game and even winning points in a few close ones. Advertisement Take a late third-period goal in Philadelphia that got them a point. Or erasing a three-goal deficit in Pittsburgh to force another overtime. Or their most recent game Thursday in St. Louis where Alex Wennberg scored with 8.8 seconds left to pull the Sharks into another extra session, making two points possible when they shouldn’t have been. Even a road loss to one of the league’s best in Dallas had them one shot away from another tie game until the Stars iced the win with two empty-net goals. The Sharks aren’t good, and they’ve only begun building a new foundation, but this won’t be a club that finishes with only 19 wins or a minus-150 goal differential. Wins against them won’t come as easy. “We’ve come to believe that and come to feel that, understand that we’re never going to give up,” Warsofsky said. “We can come back from any deficit. We’ve done a good job of that this year. There’s obviously some areas in the game that can continue to improve. “I give a lot of credit to the group in there to stick together. We’ve been through a lot the first 22 games. Even this last 2 ½ weeks the travel, the time change, the difference. We haven’t practiced much. The execution was a little bit lower the last couple games. I think more fatigue kind of set in a little bit.” One-fourth of their schedule is behind them and it’s a good time to take stock of performances through the roster. We’ll keep Yarsolav Askarov out of this as he’s played only one game with the Sharks, but his debut Thursday was an auspicious one as he shook off a Nathan Walker goal 11 seconds in and stopped 29 of 31 Blues shots. We’ll also leave out Logan Couture and Thomas Bordeleau as Couture hasn’t played as he deals with injury issues and Bordeleau has been in the AHL after being set back by a lower-body injury through the preseason. Macklin Celebrini, Mackenzie Blackwood, Mikael Granlund, William Eklund, Fabian Zetterlund Let’s see, there are the four goals and three assists that Celebrini has totaled in only 10 games that he’s played. Or what about the strong backchecking that he’s already committed to doing as an 18-year-old center playing top-six minutes? Or that he’ll keep his team alive with a diving play to break up a sure empty-net goal? Or that each charge into the offensive zone invokes excitement and possibility? Maybe we’ll just consider what he did on Monday for his first game-winning goal. MACKLIN CELEBRINI IN OVERTIME!  HIS FIRST NHL GAME-WINNING GOAL!#TheFutureIsTeal pic.twitter.com/cMOjEA2Hyf — Hockey Daily 365 l NHL Highlights & News (@HockeyDaily365) November 19, 2024  Celebrini missed 12 games due to a hip issue and it hasn’t been perfect (Wednesday’s game in Dallas is an example). He has ground to make up in the Calder Trophy conversation, but some good health and production on the power play could close the gap on early leading candidates, such as Matvei Michkov and Logan Stankoven. Advertisement Blackwood, meanwhile, isn’t going to be among any league leaders, but he’s been outstanding with a .908 save percentage while saving nearly four more goals than expected, per MoneyPuck. The impending free agent also had a 44-save shutout against his former club, the New Jersey Devils. There’s a reason Warsofsky has reunited Granlund with Eklund and Zetterlund as his wingers. They just work together. Last season’s best line is leading the way again. Granlund’s great revival in San Jose continues as he’s at a point-per-game pace while scoring nine times and leading the team in assists (15) and points (24). Eklund had an early stretch of seven points in seven games and is now cooking again with seven points in his last six, including a two-goal game against the Red Wings. Zetterlund isn’t shooting the puck as much, but he’s scoring at a higher rate while posting better defensive metrics in 5-on-5 play. Tyler Toffoli, Jake Walman, Alexander Wennberg, Timothy Liljegren Toffoli has given San Jose immediate payoff for its $24 million investment with a hot start and another current goal spurt to lead the club with nine. The one thing that keeps him from the “stock way up” column is that the Sharks give up more defensively at 5-on-5 when he’s on the ice. Walman has been the team’s best defenseman. He plays a high-event game that can get him into trouble on occasion, but it’s also produced chances the Sharks have capitalized on. He’s flourishing after getting lost in the crowded defense mix in Detroit. He has 10 points in his last eight games and he’s a plus player at even strength. Wennberg has helped the Sharks upgrade at the center position. The 30-year-old Swede is doing what the team needs need in the third-line role. He’s been their best defensive forward when it comes to expected goals against per 60 minutes of 5-on-5 play (2.44); he’s winning faceoffs at a career-best 54.4 percent and he has chipped in two overtime winners. Advertisement Meanwhile, the Sharks are seeing the strong underlying numbers that Liljegren brought to Toronto and there’s nothing wrong with having a plus-1 rating in 10 games since the trade. Will Smith, Vitek Vaněček, Jack Thompson, Henry Thrun, Luke Kunin, Ty Dellandrea, Barclay Goodrow, Carl Grundstrom, Nico Sturm The 19-year-old Smith is still finding his stride while occasionally sitting as part of a development plan. He has been moved to the wing and is now playing on a line with Celebrini. It’s tough to be too critical of someone just starting out in the NHL, even if he was a top-five pick in his draft year. Smith, who got both of his goals on Oct. 31 against Chicago after not appearing on the scoresheet in his first eight games, has flashed his vision and playmaking, but it’s also taken him some time to find the right pace consistently. While Blackwood has stepped forward as the No. 1 in goal, Vaněček has been capable in most of his starts. Two games — a seven-spot allowed against Vegas and his last injury-abbreviated outing in Pittsburgh — have skewed his numbers worse than what his play has been. Thompson has shown some offensive instincts from the blue line, but the pickup of the right-shooting Liljegren has cut into his ice time. Thrun handled more minutes when Walman was sidelined for a few games, but the third-pairing role suits him as he tries to keep a spot that younger, high-upside prospects are pushing toward. The remaining five are doing what you would expect from veteran grinders mostly slotted on the bottom two lines. All have made the Sharks deeper up front and more competitive on a nightly basis. Kunin and Sturm, who are on expiring deals, are the holdovers from last season. Kunin’s gritty play sets an example for more talented mates to follow, while Sturm remains a faceoff ace and penalty killer properly suited as their 4C. Goodrow, Dellandrea and Grundstrom are the additions and won’t put up many points, but they’ll battle and compete. If anything, Goodrow is probably playing more minutes than he should. Mario Ferraro, Jan Rutta, Danil Gushchin, Givani Smith There weren’t any expectations of the Sharks’ defense morphing into a group that squeezed the life out of teams, but three regulars who eat a consistent number of minutes on the blue line being in this section isn’t a promising sign. Advertisement The good thing with Walman’s overall fine play is that it takes some of the load off Ferraro, who was tasked with a top-pairing role last season. The bad thing is that Ferraro’s play has taken a turn for the worse with a little less responsibility. Per Evolving-Hockey, his xGA/60 has shot up to 3.63 after posting a 2.99 in 2023-24. Offense isn’t Ferraro’s forte but he’s a non-factor so far, as is Rutta. Rutta’s defensive metrics are slightly better, but he’s also been tasked with fewer minutes against top lines. Though they’re just two parts to the penalty kill, the unit’s competency helps. (San Jose is tied for 12th). Gushchin is back in the AHL as he couldn’t parlay a strong preseason into a material impact in his 10 games with the Sharks. He had one assist and 13 shots (33 shot attempts) on goal. Smith has long been a part-timer, but after appearing in 36 games last season he has appeared in only five of the first 22 contests. His ice time is also down from 7:49 on average in 2023-24 to 5:47. Cody Ceci, Klim Kostin Going from a Stanley Cup finalist in Edmonton to a recent bottom-feeder with San Jose was going to do a number on Ceci’s metrics. But the veteran, who was acquired from the Oilers in August, has the worst xGA/60 (3.48) among their defensemen. Natural Stat Trick also has him being on the ice for 104 more scoring chances against than what the Sharks create in 5-on-5 play. He’s also been on the ice for 21 even-strength goals against, tying him with Ferraro for the most on the team. The disparity in high-danger chances (99 allowed, 52 generated) outdistances any other player. Even though the offseason changes to the forward group made a spot in the lineup more tenuous, Kostin has been a disappointment. Warsofsky has given the 25-year-old more turns lately, but he hasn’t played 10 minutes in any game since the season’s first week. Kostin has been more physical in his return to action, but he has only eight shots on goal in his 11 contests after scoring five times in 19 games following his acquisition from the Red Wings.

Gabehart is moving into the role of competition director, JGR said, a position where he will oversee and work closely with the crew chiefs and engineers on all four of JGR’s Cup teams. JGR also fields cars for drivers Christopher Bell, Chase Briscoe and Ty Gibbs, the grandson of team owner Joe Gibbs. One of the crew chiefs Gabehart will work with in his new role is Gayle, who led Gibbs’ team the past two years. 🚨 NEWS 🚨  Joe Gibbs Racing has promoted Chris Gabehart to Competition Director. Chris Gayle will become crew chief for @dennyhamlin and the 11 team. Crew Chief for the 54 team will be announced at a later date. pic.twitter.com/iooRWcmzJb — Joe Gibbs Racing (@JoeGibbsRacing) November 22, 2024  Gabehart has a sterling reputation within the garage. He is regarded as a crew chief who knows how to find every sliver of speed, devise savvy strategies, and motivate masterfully. In an anonymous survey The Athletic conducted with all 16 playoff drivers in September, Gabehart received eight votes as the crew chief they would most want to have. (Cliff Daniels, Kyle Larson’s crew chief, received the second-most votes with five.)

GO DEEPER Anonymous NASCAR playoff drivers poll: Title favorite, preferred format and more Hamlin and Gabehart began working together in 2019, a union that rejuvenated Hamlin’s career and saw him evolve into a perennial championship contender. Prior to Gabehart leading the No. 11 team, Hamlin failed to win a race during the 2018 season, led a low number of laps (380) and ranked 11th in points. But during his six years with Gabehart, Hamlin ranked second in the series in wins (22) and laps led (6,072), qualified for the Championship 4 playoff finale three times and ranked fifth or better in points in five of six years. The Hamlin-Gabehart team was the second longest among active driver-crew chief pairings, surpassed only by crew chief Alan Gustafson and Chase Elliott, who’ve been together since 2016. Gabehart is the 10th notable crew chief this offseason to either shift to a different role within their respective organization or join an entirely new team. JGR tasked the veteran Gayle with filling Gabehart’s big shoes. In addition to his two years with Gibbs, Gayle served as crew chief for Erik Jones for four years. Last year, Gayle guided Gibbs to a first-ever playoff appearance. This followed Gibbs winning Rookie of the Year honors in 2023, and the 2022 Xfinity Series championship — both of which came with Gayle as his crew chief. (Photo of Gayle: Jared C.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Jameis Winston is playing just well enough to complicate the Browns' future plans at QB,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5939954/2024/11/22/browns-steelers-jameis-winston/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 13:43:33 GMT",Nothing about this season has been normal. Could Winston serve as a bridge quarterback until the Browns settle on a long-term solution?,"CLEVELAND — The door to the locker room swung open late Thursday night and Jameis Winston jogged down the hallway singing “Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way.”  Winston has certainly been a holiday gift of sorts for the Browns these last few weeks. But he’s also perhaps complicating their plans.  Advertisement In four starts since replacing Deshaun Watson at quarterback, Winston has guided the Browns to a pair of victories — over heavyweight division rivals Baltimore and Pittsburgh, no less. He already leads the team in passing yards and touchdowns, and his charismatic nature has provided some memorable sermons and lighthearted social media clips in what has otherwise been a dreary season and a miserable trudge to the finish line.  Winston’s first snow game Thursday was a success. Yes, he fumbled and threw an interception on a night the Browns inexplicably insisted on continuously throwing the ball in a snowstorm. But he also threw for 219 yards, completed a huge fourth-down pass to Jerry Jeudy in the fourth quarter and handed the Steelers a bitter 24-19 loss on a night weather certainly was a factor.  GO DEEPER Browns stun Steelers 24-19 in snow as Chubb scores late TD: Takeaways We’d already seen the best and worst of Winston seven days apart after he threw for 334 yards and three touchdowns in a win over the Ravens, only to follow it with three interceptions in a loss to the Chargers. That’s who he is. It’s who he’s always been.  I’ve never gotten the impression the Browns ever considered Winston a potential long-term fit at quarterback. It’s worth noting he was demoted to third string not long ago. That was not intended to be a one-week hiatus. The Browns were migrating toward Dorian Thompson-Robinson as the backup as Watson floundered.  When Watson went down with the Achilles injury against the Cincinnati Bengals, I wrote they should turn to Thompson-Robinson — again, with the understanding Winston wasn’t really viewed as a long-term solution. The Browns were able to nab Winston as a free agent on a one-year deal worth $4 million, which is essentially minimum wage for quarterbacks. They tried trading him on cutdown day but found no real offers, so they kept him and eventually released Tyler Huntley.  Advertisement Clearly, in a quarterback-starved league, no one else seemed to believe in him, either. We haven’t seen Winston for an extended period since his infamous 33-touchdown, 30-interception season in Tampa Bay in 2019.  After watching mid-career resurgences by Geno Smith, Sam Darnold and now Baker Mayfield, it would be foolish to assume Winston couldn’t do the same.  JAMEIS WINSTON AIRBORNE IN THE SNOW FOR SIX!#PITvsCLE on Prime VideoAlso streaming on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/BWdtg7I83A — NFL (@NFL) November 22, 2024  Nevertheless, DTR is the quarterback who was drafted here and whom the organization has now invested two years of development.  The biggest flaw to DTR can’t be fixed. He looks too small and fragile to survive an entire season. He gets hurt seemingly every time he plays. The Browns like his potential, and in a lost season it just makes sense to get a long look at a player you drafted and make a definitive conclusion on what he is or isn’t before setting the rest of the offseason quarterback plans. Winston is not allowing that to happen.  Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Winston is 30 and only 20 months older than Watson. He has a bit of present-day Joe Flacco to him in a body a decade younger. Winston, like Flacco, can spin it for a lot of yards, but the interceptions can also spin a team into a ditch and out of a game quickly.  I wrote near the end of last season Flacco could not return to this team under any circumstance. This franchise was in a much different place a year ago and was still trying to make Watson as comfortable as possible. That’s no longer true. Now it’s about what is best for the franchise moving forward, not Deshaun Watson.  Could Winston, at minimum, serve as a bridge quarterback next year until the Browns settle on a long-term solution? His schtick can wear on teams — again, look at the lack of interest around the league — but there’s little debate he can pile up yards in this league. Since taking over as the starter in Week 8, Winston is among the leaders in yards per pass attempt.  A brrrr-illiant performance by Jameis Winston earned him our Star of the Game ❄️🤩#DawgPound | @RhettNFL | @MJD pic.twitter.com/XEQjSP4vPr — NFL GameDay (@NFLGameDay) November 22, 2024  Now that we have nearly five years of data on Kevin Stefanski, what seems clear is the most important trait in his quarterback is not turning the ball over. At least that’s true when he’s running his offense, not whatever this version is they’re trying to blend with Ken Dorsey as offensive coordinator.  Advertisement If this season has taught the Browns anything, hopefully it’s that Stefanski’s system wasn’t the issue. Kyler Murray has the Arizona Cardinals in first place running the same offense — Cardinals offensive coordinator Drew Petzing was on Stefanski’s staff for three seasons and essentially took this same offense to the desert. The Cardinals are in first place at 6-4 and Murray has often raved this season about how much he loves Petzing’s system.  “Within this system that we have now, I feel like there’s a lot of room to grow,” Murray said in September. “If I can just be myself and play the game, the sky’s the limit.” Murray has 12 touchdowns and three interceptions in 10 games.  If Winston can minimize the turnovers, he’s at least worth looking at as a short-term fix. If he continues as the starter, he might play the Browns out of position to draft one of the top quarterbacks in this draft, which further muddles the plan. It’s a complicated situation with no simple solution that Winston, strangely, isn’t helping by playing well enough to win games.  Nothing about this season has been normal. And a 2-8 team beating an 8-2 division rival on a Thursday night just bakes into this cake of absurd. Stefanski is now 15-13 against the AFC North, which isn’t too bad given the Browns’ history and the quality of the opponents.  GO DEEPER Browns show resilience and poise in grinding out snowstorm win over Steelers For now, the Browns have to keep starting Winston. There was joy in the locker room Thursday night after a big win over a bitter rival. Myles Garrett got to strut after outplaying T.J. Watt following their Defensive Player of the Year verbal feud, Greg Newsome aggravated George Pickens enough that Pickens tried fighting him after the game ended and for only a moment, it felt like Turkey Jones and Terry Bradshaw in this rivalry all over again. Yes, the Steelers are likely headed back to the playoffs and the Browns are headed back to the top of the draft board.  Whether they’ll be looking for a quarterback with the first pick might have to do with how well Winston plays the rest of the season. They’re in a tough spot. I don’t know how he can convince them he’s a capable long-term solution, but I don’t know how they take him out of the position, either. At least not right now.  After Winston finished his postgame interview with the Amazon crew, he dived off the television set and into the snow head first and started making snow angels.  Jameis Winston has the whole TNF crew making snow angels in celebration of a Browns victory.

He started both of Croatia’s Nations League fixtures over the recent international break but was substituted at half-time during his side’s 1-1 draw with Portugal on Monday. Advertisement Guardiola, who will remain City’s manager until the summer of 2027 after signing a two-year contract extension, confirmed that Kovacic is set for a spell on the sidelines. Before City’s game against Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, Guardiola said: “Kovacic is injured. He will be (out for) a while. Three weeks, one month.” The Athletic exclusively reported on Tuesday that Guardiola had agreed fresh terms on a new deal to take him past 10 years service for the Premier League club, with his previous contract due to expire at the end of the current campaign. The Spaniard provided a positive update on the defensive trio of John Stones, Manuel Akanji, and Nathan Ake, who have all been sidelined with injuries. He said: “John (Stones) trained yesterday. Manu (Akanji) trained yesterday. Nathan (Ake) is coming back to training. We didn’t have central defenders but now we have three. Just Ruben (Dias) is out but hopefully, he is coming back soon.  “Some players have recovered a little bit. I don’t know if they are ready to play (for) 90 minutes or play from the beginning, but to see the training sessions and see their faces is really good. A boost for all of us.” Analysis by Manchester City correspondent Sam Lee Given the overall theme of Pep Guardiola’s press conference was his new contract, it might be easy to overlook the significance of Kovacic’s injury but his absence really does leave City in a hole given their other absences. Fortunately, they appear to have several of their defenders back, but given they were already trying to find ways to cover for Rodri, losing the guy who has been the automatic replacement — and in reality the best option for the holding midfield role — is a real blow, especially with games against Tottenham and Liverpool coming up in the next week or so, and then Aston Villa and Manchester United, among others, within the period that the Croatian could miss. Advertisement Ilkay Gundogan has not been in his best form since returning in the summer and could now be required to fill in in midfield while John Stones could be another option but he has had an injury-disrupted season so far and it might be a big ask. It is likely that Guardiola will opt for a two-man holding midfield partnership, and if it is not Stones and Gundogan then it could well include Rico Lewis, who has been increasingly relied upon in midfield in recent weeks.

Van de Ven, 23, suffered the injury in the 10th minute of Tottenham’s 2-1 victory over City in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup on October 30. The 23-year-old was in tears as he walked down the tunnel and had to be consoled by team-mate Yves Bissouma. Advertisement He missed Tottenham’s next three matches in all competitions and was left out of Netherlands’ squad for their Nations League fixtures against Hungary and Bosnia. Speaking before Spurs’ defeat to Ipswich Town on November 10, head coach Ange Postecoglou said the centre-back would return after the international break but it appears he will be out for a little longer. “Micky’s still a good couple of weeks away,” he told Sky Sports. “He’s out on the grass training, but he’s still a couple of weeks away. We’re hoping by the middle of December he’ll be back and available to play.” Van de Ven previously missed two months of the 2023-24 campaign due to a hamstring injury. “We’ll get the advice from the medical team and the people working with him,” Postecoglou added. “I think there’s always a natural cautiousness with somebody who has a reoccurring problem but at the same time you don’t want to treat him with too many kid gloves around him because otherwise he’s still go to go out there and play at some point. “But it’s fair to say we’re taking all the appropriate steps and Micky will be a good judge of that as well and where he’s at.” Spurs will be hoping the defender recovers in time to feature in their Carabao Cup quarter-final tie against Manchester United on December 19. Postecoglou has also revealed that fellow central defender Romero will miss the trip to the Etihad Stadium on Saturday evening while young winger Mikey Moore “will still be out for a little bit of time” after picking up a virus before the international break. “Romero won’t be right for tomorrow’s game,” he said. “We are hoping he will be right for next week.” Analysis by Jay Harris This is a huge blow for Tottenham ahead of a busy few weeks which includes difficult fixtures against Manchester City, Roma, Bournemouth and Chelsea. Van de Ven instantly became a fan-favourite after he joined them from Wolfsburg in July 2023 for his crunching tackles and ability to powerfully drive forward with the ball out of defence. His exceptional recovery speed is also crucial to the success of Postecoglou’s high defensive line.

Davies is naturally a left-back but has played in the middle of defence on multiple occasions under Postecoglou.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How AJ Green is emerging as a defensive stalwart for the Bucks: 'This guy can defend',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5932289/2024/11/22/aj-green-bucks-defense/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 13:15:52 GMT","Using techniques he's developed on offense, Green recently has been getting the Bucks' toughest defensive assignments — and succeeding.","NBA In the third quarter of Wednesday’s game against the Chicago Bulls, the Milwaukee Bucks had a problem. Bulls shooting guard Zach LaVine, who hit a flurry of tough shots to cap a strong performance to give himself 20 points in the first half, hit his first two shots of the third quarter as the Bulls started to claw their way back from a 12-point halftime deficit. Midway through the third, LaVine had made eight of his first 10 shots. The Bucks needed to find an answer on defense. Advertisement As Gary Trent Jr. entered the game, Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo briefly thought he had figured out how his squad would slow down LaVine. But Antetokounmpo quickly realized the answer was already on the floor: AJ Green. “There was a play, I think, in the third quarter, I saw (AJ) guarding Zach LaVine and (Gary) was in the game and I was like, ‘Switch,'” Antetokounmpo said after Wednesday’s game. “And then I thought about it and I was like, ‘No, stay.’ Because he’s been playing great.” Here’s the play immediately after Trent entered the game. “His defense is incredible,” Antetokounmpo said Wednesday. “He’s staying down on pump fakes. He’s using his body very smart. I think two years ago, he would get himself in foul trouble. He’d use his hands a lot, maybe jump a little bit on the pump fake, get the guy to shoot two easy free throws. But now, he’s just solid.” Since first becoming a serious title contender in the 2018-19 season, the Bucks have spent their offseasons looking to add 3-and-D players through the draft and free agency. While Green might not have been a much-hyped signing or a first-round pick, his play this season suggests the undrafted free agent may be the guy the Bucks have been looking for all along. “He moves his feet so well, he puts his body (in position) so well and he’s an underrated defender,” Antetokounmpo said. “In my opinion, he’s a really, really good defender and he shows in practice. He shows it in games, you guys are seeing that. Like he’s not a liability on defense, he’s actually one of our better defenders on the team. “So, I’m very, very happy that he’s out there with me. He makes our defense better and when we grab the rebound and go the other way, he’s a threat from everywhere.” Advertisement As Antetokounmpo noted at the end of his description of his teammate’s improved defensive capabilities, Green, who Bucks general manager Jon Horst originally signed to a two-way contract out of the University of Northern Iowa in the summer of 2022, found his way onto the floor because of his 3-point shooting. Being able to consistently knock down shots is what earned him the trust of Mike Budenholzer in his rookie season and Doc Rivers in the second half of his second NBA season. But putting in the work to get better on defense is what has led to consistent praise from Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard and Rivers. On Monday against the Rockets, Antetokounmpo — who knows a thing or two about spectacular defensive plays — highlighted this second-quarter possession by Green as one of the best defensive possessions of the season:   Not only did Green successfully avoid three ball screens while keeping Reed Sheppard, the third pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, outside the 3-point line, he then switched onto Jalen Green, the Rockets’ leading scorer, and kept Green out of the paint before blocking his shot attempt at the end of the shot clock. “He just slid his feet. He stayed in front of the ball,” Rivers said of Green’s defense against the Rockets. “They kept trying him and we’re like, ‘You’re picking on the wrong guy. Like, this guy can defend.’ “But he’s young, they don’t know his name and they decided, well, let’s attack him and it went in our favor most of the time.” When Green stepped on the floor during his first two seasons, most scouting reports noted that he could shoot it and the Bucks were going to run various actions to try to get him open from 3. Rarely did those same scouting reports warn players about trying to score against Green on the other end. Advertisement As he has matured and attempted to solidify his spot as a rotation player, Green has found that one of the skills he has honed over the years as a knockdown shooter can also be useful on the defensive end. When Green goes through his pregame routine in Fiserv Forum, he sprints around the floor, pretending to whip around screens and flipping his hips to square his body to the basket to fire off 3-pointers from unusual angles. While it might not be the first connection people make, the same movements that allow Green to bend around a pindown screen shoulder-to-shoulder with one of his teammates also allow him to avoid a screen at the last second or stay connected to a ballhandler as opposing big men try to hit him with screens on defense. Watch Green stay connected to Rockets guard Jalen Green on this double drag screen in Monday’s game: The way Green sprints to catch up to the Rockets’ leading scorer after the first screen and avoid the second screen is the same way that Green would try to shake free from a defender running around a double screen on the offensive end. “On offense or defense, it’s all about movement and footwork,” Green told The Athletic. “And some of the ways you need to move can be very similar.” Rivers joked after Wednesday’s game that he hopes scouting reports don’t catch up and teams keep attacking Green for the rest of the season. Lillard has been around Green for a year and while he believes his teammate has made it clear he is a good defender, opponents might keep testing Green far longer than one would expect considering the current results. “He’s strong. He has good feet. He’s smart. He’s competitive,” Lillard said. “He’s tough and I think he understands who he’s guarding. You know, he’s a student. They put these sheets on our chairs in the locker room with information about everybody and you see him looking at it. He asks a lot of questions and stuff like that. Advertisement “So I think everybody might be surprised because he’s a 6-3 white guy, but I mean, if you look at him physically, he’s strong, he moves well. And like I said, he’s smart, he’s tough, and he’s actually a good defender, so I think that might catch people by surprise.” When told of Lillard’s appraisal, Green was not shy about his feelings on the topic. “I love it though,” Green said with a smile. “That’s fine with me. I try to take pride in playing defense and rising to that challenge and doing it for the team. The team needs it and so I look forward to it.” This is how Green has responded throughout the season when asked about getting targeted on defense. When the Bucks took on the Celtics in Milwaukee, Celtics stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, who are among the league’s preeminent mismatch hunters, spent much of the afternoon attacking Green. Asked about getting targeted by the Celtics in the Bucks’ 113-107 loss, Green told reporters he enjoys the challenge. “Absolutely, (it’s fun),” Green said with a smile, when asked about isolation defense possessions against Tatum, Brown, and Jrue Holiday. “I think every game, you have to have that mindset of you want the matchups and you want to prove that you get stops guarding those guys. So, yeah, it’s fun to compete and see what you got.” Often, when Green speaks about what occurs in a game, he talks about competition. After a stretch of games in which the Bucks were getting beat to loose balls to start the season, Green made it a priority to dive on the floor to secure extra possessions. “It’s really just trying to compete and make it hard,” Green said. “Guys are good and you’re never going to stop somebody completely. Each night, it’s going to be a different guy, so just trying to be consistent in how I compete and how I try to make it difficult defensively.” Advertisement Despite his strides, Green is not a perfect defender. He makes mistakes and he was a major part of the botched switches that left Alperen Şengün wide open underneath the basket on the final play of Monday’s game, but Green did not run from that mistake. He owned it and talked about trying to get better. “It’s a lot of just learning and being aware and learning and then applying and figuring out what you need to get better at and then how to get better at that,” Green said on Monday. “So, a lot of watching film, thinking about it, talking about it with our coaches and the strength stuff. How do I get better at this thing? Is it a positional thing? Is it a physical quality? “So just a the cycle of learning, how do I get better at it, work on it, learning, just a never-ending cycle.” If that cycle continues to yield positive results, Green should continue to earn a larger part in Rivers’ rotation and could end up being a true two-way weapon for the Bucks. For now, Green making an impact defensively has been a pleasant surprise for a team struggling to find its footing at the start of the season.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Inside Poona Ford's resurgent season for Chargers defense: 'He’s really hungry',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938996/2024/11/22/poona-ford-chargers-defense-bills/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 13:01:42 GMT",Ford signed a veteran minimum contract with the Chargers after barely playing for the Bills last season. He's been a revelation.,"NFL EL SEGUNDO, Calif. — Poona Ford knew all he needed was a chance. What he did not know is where it would come from — or if it would arrive at all. Ford had just endured what he described as a “real frustrating” 2023 season with the Buffalo Bills. After five quality years with the Seattle Seahawks, Ford signed a one-year deal with Buffalo in free agency. He ended up out of the defensive line rotation. Advertisement Ford was a healthy scratch for three straight games starting in Week 3. By Week 6, he was back on the field because of injuries. But in early November, the Bills signed Linval Joseph off the street, and Ford was back to the bench. He was inactive for six straight games after the Joseph signing. In total, Ford was a healthy scratch for nine of the Bills’ 17 games. “After a while, I was just like, f— it,” Ford said. “It is what it is at this point.” Ford looked ahead into an uncertain future. In March, the opportunity arrived. The Los Angeles Chargers called. They were led by a new regime of coach Jim Harbaugh and general manager Joe Hortiz. This was not just a shot to make a roster. This was a shot to start. This was a shot to get the reps he needed to reestablish himself on the NFL stage. “Having somebody that believes in your abilities,” Ford said, “it makes you want to give them everything you got.” GO DEEPER 'Starting to believe': Jim Harbaugh makes Chargering a thing of the past in win over Bengals In 10 games so far this season, Ford has repaid Harbaugh and Hortiz by being one of the most impactful free agent signings in the league. Ford signed for a veteran minimum base salary. He has vastly outperformed his contract. Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter has led a dramatic turnaround with his unit. The Chargers have the best scoring defense in football. Ford’s performance, both as a run defender and pass rusher, has been instrumental in the Chargers’ defensive resurgence. “I took it and ran with it,” Ford said. Ford has been a stout and disruptive presence on the interior since the very first game of the season, a 22-10 win over the Las Vegas Raiders. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. That game was locked in a scoreless tie late in the first quarter when the Raiders faced a fourth-and-1 from their 41-yard line. Las Vegas opted to test the middle of the Chargers’ defensive line. That proved to be a mistake, thanks to Ford. As quarterback Gardner Minshew II took the shotgun snap and handed to running back Zamir White, Ford quickly shifted to his right. He then extended into the chest of center Andre James and occupied the “A” gap between James and left guard Cody Whitehair.    Ford then powered forward to take the lead blocker, tight end Michael Mayer. And Ford was strong enough to maintain his leverage on James.  He gave up no ground to Mayer.  And Ford smothered White for a 1-yard loss.  Turnover on downs. The Chargers took over in Las Vegas territory. Four plays later, they kicked a field goal for their first points of the Harbaugh era. “There’s a level of consistency and physicality,” defensive line coach Mike Elston said of Ford. “He raises everybody’s game around him.” Ford’s run defending continued to be a spark for the Chargers defense. This was a second-down run stuff on the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Najee Harris in the first quarter in Week 3. Ford bench-pressed right tackle Broderick Jones in a one-on-one matchup, shed the block and then stone-walled a Harris cutback after a 1-yard gain.        Ford’s presence in the run front has allowed Minter to devote more resources to the back end. The Chargers play with more light boxes than any defense in the league. They have aligned with six or fewer defenders in the box on more than 80 percent of their plays, according to TruMedia. Despite this, the Chargers have been a good run defense. Through 11 weeks, they ranked fourth in defensive EPA per play against designed rushes, according to TruMedia. Advertisement “He’s been really the anchor for us in the middle of the defense,” Minter said. “He’s allowed us to do different things in our coverage because of our ability to stop the run at times with less people. He’s certainly a big, big piece of that.” Here is an example from late in the third quarter of the Chargers’ Week 6 win at the Denver Broncos. The Broncos came out in 11 personnel, a three-receiver package. The Chargers matched with five defensive backs in their big nickel package. That left the Chargers with six defenders in the box.  Ford aligned over left guard Ben Powers. As quarterback Bo Nix took the snap and handed off to running Jaleel McLaughlin, Powers tried to drive Ford laterally.   Ford was patient, waiting for his opportunity. Then he attacked and once again got extension.  As McLaughlin tried to hit the hole, Ford used that extension to shed Powers.  And he got the solo tackle for no gain.  Ford was already outperforming his contract early in the year with his play in run defense. What has turned this into a truly profound season — and one that should put him firmly in the Pro Bowl conversation — is how he has impacted the game as a pass rusher in recent weeks. Ford has a sack in three of the past four games. He has tied his career high in sacks on the season. The counting stats have come during this four-game winning streak. But Ford was showing signs of his pass-rush capability earlier in the season. Late in the first half of the Broncos game, Ford took likely points off the board by drawing a hold. The penalty wiped out a 46-yard completion from Nix to receiver Courtland Sutton that would have moved Denver into field goal range. Ford beat right guard Quinn Meinerz on the play.      The following week at the Arizona Cardinals, Ford saved a touchdown on a coverage breakdown in the Chargers’ secondary. Cardinals receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. was wide open after winning on a double move.      Quarterback Kyler Murray, though, was knocked off his spot by a bull-rush pressure from Ford. And Murray could not get his eyes downfield in time to find Harrison.   The sacks were going to come. That was evident because of how Ford was rushing on a snap-to-snap basis. He has won convincingly and in varied ways on his sacks. He has won with agility. He was won with speed. And he has won with power. “For a guy that’s built like a nose tackle, he’s really twitchy,” Minter said. “He’s fast, quick off the ball, uses his hands really well.” No sack was more impressive than this spin move against the New Orleans Saints in Week 8.     “He’s really hungry to kind of prove himself as the caliber of player that he kind of knows he is and we think he is,” Minter said. “He’s doing that so far.” Ford agreed that he arrived in L.A. with a certain edge, because of “how they tried to do me” in Buffalo. However, when asked what kind of statement he thinks he’s made this year, Ford looked up from his seat at his locker with a puzzled expression. Advertisement “Statement?” he replied. “It’s not a statement to me, to be honest.” Why not? “Because I’m not surprised,” Ford said. “I’ve been doing this s—. That’s about it.” He just needed the chance to play. The Chargers saw the upside. They are reaping the benefits. “He’s the kind of player that does,” Harbaugh said. “It’s all what he’s doing, whether that’s in the meeting environment, the training environment, the practice environment, game environment. He’s all about his business and doing his job at a really high level.” (Top photo: Michael Owens / Getty Images; screenshots via NFL+) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Can Joe Philbin unlock potential in Raiders' offensive line? 'We're not reinventing the wheel',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938966/2024/11/22/joe-philbin-raiders-offensive-line/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 13:01:09 GMT","""I still love teaching,"" said Philbin, the Raiders interim offensive line coach and former Miami Dolphins head coach.","NFL HENDERSON, Nev. — One can list many things that must happen for the Las Vegas Raiders to snap a six-game losing streak Sunday against the Denver Broncos, or even just win a game or two the rest of the season. But there is no question what is at the top of the list. The offensive line has to play better, and the 2-8 Raiders have enlisted the help of former Miami Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin, 63, to help shepherd that. Philbin started coaching offensive linemen 38 years ago at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute and cracked the NFL 17 years later. Advertisement “I still love teaching,” Philbin said Tuesday. “I still love going to practice and then watching the players perform at a high level on Sundays. And I love the guys I am working with.” Philbin, who came on board this year as a senior offensive assistant, took over as offensive line coach two weeks ago when James Cregg was fired — along with offensive coordinator Luke Getsy and quarterbacks coach Rich Scangerello — because the Raiders were dead last in the league in rushing. (They are also 27th with 33 sacks allowed, though some of those are on quarterback Gardner Minshew II.) Philbin said he made “minimal tweaks” at practice last week. The Raiders set a season high with 22 first downs and the timing was better in the passing game in the 34-19 loss in Miami, but they had only 60 yards rushing. “We’re not reinventing the wheel,” rookie center Jackson Powers-Johnson said. GO DEEPER How did the Raiders roster get so bad? A series of unfortunate events “The fundamentals of the game haven’t changed, and the offensive lineman’s job is to create space for the running back,” Philbin said. “How do you that? You have to hit your aiming point, you have to play with leverage and then you have to sustain blocks. “In pass protection, I use the analogy of man-to-man defense in basketball. The quarterback is the hoop, and the further away you keep your guy from the hoop, their shooting percentage is less and less. This game is simple, but not easy.” The Miami game was the first start for the group of left tackle Kolton Miller, left guard Jordan Meredith, center Powers-Johnson, right guard Dylan Parham and right tackle DJ Glaze, and the hope is they start a streak together. “You just hate that we keep changing all these pieces because at some point, you’d like just to have five guys there, continuity, chemistry,” coach Antonio Pierce said. “That’s really the glue to our team, when you can have that … you won’t have these mistakes and mental errors that we had early in the season.”  Miller and Parham are the only two still standing from the season-opening lineup, as Powers-Jackson, the team’s second-round pick, made his first start at right guard in Week 4 (for Cody Whitehair) before replacing the injured Andre James at center two games ago. Meredith filled in for an injured Parham for three games before taking over at right guard last week. Glaze stepped in for an injured Thayer Munford Jr. in Week 4 before beating him out. Advertisement “We’ve got a great group of guys to work with,” Philbin said. “Great pros that have given great effort. Things don’t happen overnight, but we’re taking incremental steps. We have a long way to go, and I have to do a better job of giving us a better design in the running game. Pierce and new interim offensive coordinator Scott Turner talked about how the communication has to improve up front, and Philbin thinks it has in Powers-Jackson’s two starts making the calls at center.

He has an exuberance for the game, which is good. … When in doubt, you can overcommunicate to make sure that the five offensive linemen, tight end and running back are all on the same page pre-snap.” Though there is an urgency to win a game, there is no rushing the process of this group getting better during the practice week. “Joe has been great for us, fundamental-wise,” Parham said. “And we’re taking our time, nothing is being rushed. We may spend more time on our footwork than the scheme some days. And we need to be a little more intentional with our communication, whether it’s in the film room or on the field. “We’re saying assignments out loud in the meeting rooms now, so everyone knows what the other guy is doing.” Parham was a third-round pick, as was Glaze this year, and Miller was a first-rounder and Powers-Johnson a second-rounder. There’s some pedigree there. Miller established himself as one of the better left tackles in the league but had a rough start this year after missing all of training camp recovering from offseason shoulder surgery. GO DEEPER Can the Raiders get the QB they need in the 2025 NFL Draft? If not, where should they turn? “He has rare knee-bend for a man of his size,” Philbin said. “And his movement skill is excellent. He missed a lot of practice, so these next seven games, all those reps he has not gotten will pay dividends. He is what you’re looking for in a left tackle in this league.” Unlike his cohorts, Meredith was undrafted (out of Western Kentucky in 2021) and has scratched and clawed his way up the depth chart. He was waived after an initial training camp with the Los Angeles Rams, was signed and waived three times by the Raiders, then spent two weeks on the Cleveland Browns practice squad in November 2022 before returning to the Raiders. Advertisement “Jordan Meredith … we haven’t talked enough about him, but Jordan’s done a hell of a job filling in, and the way he’s been playing, he’s earned the right to be a starter going forward,” Pierce said. Meredith said Philbin’s approach is the key to the coach’s history of success and why there is hope for this group. “Slow is smooth and smooth is fast,” Meredith said. “That’s kind of the way he teaches. The speed picks up as the week goes on, and by game time, you are in peak shape.” The Raiders hope they are in better shape than they were a week ago and then will just go from there. “It’s easy for me, with the remote, to hit rewind 20 times and draw a yellow line or circle on the video screen with my finger,” Philbin said. “But they don’t have that luxury. … With the play speed, the different looks and the different blitzes, there’s a lot going on and it happens very fast.” (Photo: Jeff Moreland / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Should the Giants trade Mike Yastrzemski? The pros and cons,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938233/2024/11/22/sf-giants-mike-yastrzemski-trade-options/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 13:00:04 GMT",Yastrzemski is one of the Giants’ most valuable players. Can they really get better by trading him?,"MLB In the previous two installments of this three-part series — the first on LaMonte Wade Jr., and the second on Camilo Doval — it took a lot of highfalutin words to reach an expected conclusion. Yes, the San Francisco Giants would trade (player) if the deal made their team better. They would trade (player) if another team overpaid with their offer of prospects, but they would keep him if they weren’t getting good offers. They’d probably trade Logan Webb for Jackson Merrill, Michael King, Ethan Salas and $10 million in international bonus money, too. Advertisement This one will be a little different. Mike Yastrzemski is a lot of things, and an important one to remember is that he’s a helpful baseball player. There isn’t a roster in baseball that wouldn’t improve with him on it, and if you’re rolling your eyes, boy, are you underestimating just how many outfield positions there are to fill in baseball. There are 90 starting spots, and if you add in a couple reserves for each team, that’s 150 outfielders that have to be sourced every year. Here’s where Yastrzemski ranked in WAR among all outfielders (min. 20 games) since his rookie season: 2019 — 31 out of 198
2020 — 2 out of 137
2021 — 41 out of 206
2022 — 41 out of 195
2023 — 42 out of 195
2024 — 47 out of 181 Other than the outlier season, Yastrzemski has been remarkably consistent. The best way to describe him goes something like this: If he’s your best outfielder, that’s not great. If he’s your second-best outfielder, it’s probably an average outfield. If he’s your third-best outfielder, that’s probably a pretty sweet outfield you got going there. And if he’s a fourth or even fifth outfielder, that means you’re presiding over an embarrassment of riches. It’s not hyperbolic to suggest that there was a decade-long stretch where the Cleveland Guardians might have won at least one championship with a couple extra Yastrzemski-level outfielders. Yastrzemski is a player who helps teams win baseball games, yes, but he’s other things too. He’s ill-suited to be a primary offensive contributor, either in the leadoff spot or in the middle of an order. He’s an excellent corner outfielder, but he’s a less dynamic center fielder. And, unfortunately, he might be a luxury for a team on a silly, self-imposed path to austerity. Trading him is less about the players coming back in a trade and more about the roster and payroll space that opens up. Advertisement So let’s see why the Giants would even think about trading away a player who could help them. There’s no sense in spending two minutes on a GIF, only to use it once. Especially when it might be the GIF of the offseason.  Yastrzemski will likely make close to $9.5 million next season. That’s slightly underpaid compared to the $/WAR metric on FanGraphs, a stat that every organization has their own version of. But if the Giants are setting a soft, internal salary cap that’s below the fake salary cap, that’s a lot of money for a good player on a roster that needs more very good players. Let’s say that Yastrzemski’s salary on another team gives the Giants a chance to sign, I don’t know, Teoscar Hernández. He’s an outfielder who would offer more dingers and less defense than Yastrzemski, which might be a worthwhile swap for a team that needs more dingers and has the highest ground-ball rate in the league. You might be saying, “Hey, couldn’t the Giants afford both of them? They seem like very complementary players.” However, you already know the answer to that is “No. And please try the new 16 oz. Colby Cheese Stout, just $18 ($24 for commemorative souvenir cup).” Yastrzemski’s contributions are harder to appreciate on a roster where he’s hitting fifth or leading off, as he won’t have the runners on base or the hitters to drive him in, respectively. He’s a little-things-right player on a big-things-wrong roster, and while that doesn’t mean he isn’t helping the Giants win more games than they would without him, the team should always be hunting for outfielders who are even better. If freeing up his reasonable salary is how that gets done, they’ll have to consider it. However, another consideration is that of opportunity cost. Baseball teams are allowed to use only three outfielders at a time, despite my constant letters to the commissioner’s office, and the Giants already have two in place for next season. Heliot Ramos deserves the chance to build on his All-Star season, and he’s young enough to hope his ceiling is even higher. Jung Hoo Lee is still something of an unknown, but the previous regime gave him a good chunk of money, and the new regime would be silly not to leave him alone in the leadoff spot until they figure out what they have. Advertisement Behind them, the Giants have Luis Matos and Wade Meckler, a pair of outfielders with similar, confusing skill sets. Neither one of them should be handed a starting job, but both of them are about as likely to turn into an everyday player as Ramos was to turn into an All-Star. As in, not especially likely, but likely enough to keep a close eye on them. Grant McCray hit for just enough power to make him interesting. And there also might be outfield innings for Tyler Fitzgerald, depending on what else happens this offseason. Don’t forget that the plan for Marco Luciano might be a move to the outfield, which is an idea that’s just wacky enough to work. Not a single one of these other options is likelier to be as valuable as Yastrzemski in 2025, but if they trust the younger outfielders enough, they can feel more comfortable moving Yastrzemski if it helps them improve a different position. And, of course, the more obvious consideration is still there. If another team wants to help the Giants fill a roster hole or improve their farm system in a Yastrzemski trade, that might be reason enough. The problem with the 2024 Giants is that they didn’t win enough baseball games. They should be looking to add wins in 2025, not subtract them. By getting rid of Yastrzemski, they’ll be getting rid of their fourth-most (according to Baseball-Reference) or fifth-most (according to FanGraphs) valuable position player, which would be a funny way of adding wins. He’s not the problem. He’s a part of the solution, which is to get superstar players and surround them with helpful players. The Giants don’t need to sell their watch to buy a hairbrush, and they don’t need to sell their hair to buy a watch chain. You can’t really expect the Giants to replace Yastrzemski‘s production from Meckler, Matos, McCray or M. Luciano without more evidence. That’s something to hope for, not plan around. And it’s going to be much harder to replace Yastrzemski’s value without — wait for it — spending even more money. There’s a switch-hitting outfielder without platoon splits on the market, and he hit 44 home runs despite playing at a park that’s just as tough on right-handed hitters as Oracle Park. He just turned 30 in October. Seems like a match, right? He’ll make about twice as much as Yastrzemski for five years, when he’s roughly the age that Yastrzemski is now. This is Anthony Santander, and all the Giants would have to do is convince him to take their money. Except if the Giants are trading Yastrzemski, it’ll be to free up money for one of their other priorities, either in the rotation or at shortstop. They’d need to take from the outfield to improve the roster elsewhere and hope they come out ahead on the balance sheet. They might just prefer to keep the helpful player and add other helpful players, freeing up salary another way, or simply going over their intended budget a little bit. That’s not just a free book idea for Michael Lewis (call me to hammer out the details), but a way to help the Giants win more games than they did last year. In a lot of ways, Yastrzemski is a canary in the coal mine. Keeping him and adding players around him is what a normal team would do. It’s what a team that’s trying to compete would do. This is less about the Giants getting an offer they can’t refuse and more about how they view their place in the baseball ecosystem in 2025 and beyond. My guess is that he sticks around. If he’s traded, it will be for entirely avoidable and unpalatable reasons. (Photo: Gary A. Vasquez / USA Today) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How Michele Kang became one of the biggest investors in women's soccer,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940050/2024/11/22/michele-kang-womens-soccer-investment/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 12:47:26 GMT","Kang sees this moment in women's sports as a ""tipping point"" for investment, something that can't be stopped","NWSL In a Parisian café, amid the excitement of the Summer Olympics, businesswoman Michele Kang sat down for breakfast with U.S. Soccer CEO J.T. Batson. The two were scheduled to meet for an hour between the U.S. women’s national team’s semifinal win and its eventual gold medal victory over Brazil. While they had met before, they had never spoken at length. Advertisement Three hours later, the two were still there, not just talking, but in the weeds on big, foundational ideas around the women’s program. When they finally parted ways, they left with the seed of an idea that would eventually turn into the second-largest donation U.S. Soccer has received. On Tuesday, U.S. Soccer announced Kang — majority owner of the Washington Spirit, Olympique Lyonnais Féminin and London City Lionesses under her global multi-club organization Kynisca — was donating $30million (£24m). The funds are earmarked over the next five years for women’s youth national team camps, talent identification and scouting, and female coach and referee education and mentorship. GO DEEPER Spirit owner Kang pledges $30million into women's soccer programs “I had a lot of coffee,” Kang deadpanned when asked about that Paris breakfast during an interview following Tuesday’s press conference in New York City. “Michele started asking really good, insightful questions on things and ultimately got to some core issues,” Batson told The Athletic. Kang wanted to know how U.S. Soccer was thinking at a federation-wide level and Batson walked her through the long-term vision, even if that vision didn’t have secured funding and resources attached yet. These questions had been on Kang’s mind for years since she gained majority ownership of the Spirit in 2022. She knew the NWSL would need more coaches and more referees with expansion and more games. She could see the lack of technical staff at the youth levels around D.C., too. “While the professional league and professional teams’ trajectory and investments are great, it could be really temporary if we don’t have all these underlying foundational blocks,” she said. It wasn’t just the investment that needed to happen, it was attention — but that wasn’t on her alone or the NWSL. When the breakfast meeting in Paris happened, Kang had finally found an avenue for those ambitions. Advertisement “We geeked out for a few hours on what the mission-critical, core-enabling functions that we’re going to need for soccer in this country, and women’s soccer in particular, to be the best in the world,” Batson continued. “And everything led from there.” While Tuesday’s announcement earned its fair share of attention, the eye-popping investment is to be used in areas of U.S. Soccer that don’t get a lot of shine and certainly won’t get a lot of headlines over the next five years as the work is carried out. That was a motivation for Kang in many ways — this isn’t for splashy projects, such as the national training center. “It is equally — potentially more — critical that we have all the systems in place. Because if you don’t have the coaches, if you don’t have the referees, it just doesn’t work,” she said. “That’s why I felt it was important that not only I personally believe in it, but I wanted to bring attention to these issues, hoping that more people will join in and invest in it.” Kang is not one to accept things as final. “I hate following any convention if they say, ‘You’re not supposed to do it.’ I always asked why it wasn’t acceptable. So unless I understood the rationale, I wouldn’t do it,” she told The Athletic in an interview conducted in May 2022, shortly after she became the majority owner of the Washington Spirit. “So in that society where young people, especially kids, are supposed to follow the rules, I was a problem child.” Growing up as the youngest of three girls in South Korea, Kang was more curious than rebellious, always asking why. Her mother was called to her school multiple times, not because Kang was causing trouble — she was a top student — but because she would question teachers, rules and expectations. Kang’s parents had been waiting for a boy who could carry the family name. She arrived instead. She has credited her father for instilling a sense of equality and possibility in her from the beginning. He was a professor, one of the first Koreans after the Second World War who earned a U.S. government scholarship to study in America, which also meant he didn’t serve in the Korean War. Advertisement Kang was a self-described tomboy growing up. She played sports, a lot of them. Basketball was her favorite. In elementary school, she was the second tallest kid in her class. “I was going to be a basketball player, but I found out there was somebody the same age as me who played basketball in another school. She was already 6ft 2in and I said, ‘Well, I’m never going to be number one, forget it,’” Kang recalled. She played soccer and volleyball, but tennis became her primary sport before the need to study won out. Kang planned to earn her college degree at home. While her father had studied abroad in America, her parents wanted her to graduate from a Korean college to help preserve her cultural identity. She started at a co-ed college of economics, but she was the only woman enrolled. Things in South Korea were also tumultuous at the time. President Park Chung-hee was assassinated in 1979, followed by a coup led by General Chun Doo-hwan. Chun arrested his political opponents and limited political opposition. Martial law was put in place and student-led protests were violently suppressed. “The country was in turmoil. Campuses were shut down because typically, students were at the forefront of the demonstrations,” she said. Her parents were worried that if Kang was involved in those demonstrations, or arrested, it would be the end of her life as she knew it. So she devised a plan. Her parents would eventually be responsible for a dowry if she married. Instead, she told them, “When I get married, you don’t need to spend a dime. Just give me a fraction of that money so that I can pay my tuition, just one year, as a college student.” While she believed her parents would have usually said no — they had to borrow money to pay for that year of tuition — the worry over her future amid the demonstrations and dangerous political unrest got her a yes. Advertisement “I guess you could say that was my first business deal,” she said with a smile. When she got to the University of Chicago in 1981, she thrived. She turned one year into two, working in the summer as a waitress and adding a second job at the library once the semester rolled around. “There was a sitcom, ‘Cheers,’” she said. “The song, ‘You want to go where everybody knows your name’ — I wanted to go where no one knew my name because of where I grew up. With my father as a professor, I was always so and so’s daughter, so and so’s granddaughter. I absolutely hated it. I really wanted to go somewhere where no one knew who I was. If I fail, I fail, but at least it’s going to be on me as opposed to getting any special treatment.” She loved the school, loved the feel of the campus and the quad that reminded her of Oxford University. She would walk back and forth, believing she’d get smarter by absorbing the energy of the place. She went to graduate school at Yale School of Management. Coming out of her MBA, Kang said she had three 10-year plans. In the first 10, she wanted to go into consulting because the project-based nature of the work appealed to her. One day it would be supply chains, the next branding, the day after that telecommunications or manufacturing. She wanted to learn how every element of a business works. The next 10 years, even though she hated the concept, she would go to a Fortune 500 company to learn the organizational part of being in the business world and to acquire leadership skills. “At the end of the day, business is not about how smart you are, how many functional capabilities or the expertise you have, it’s about organization,” Kang said. “How do you get people below you, sideways from you, above you, how do you get them to do what you need them to do? How can you get them to work with you to accomplish common goals?” And in the third decade, she was going to become a Fortune 500 CEO. Advertisement “That’s also why I left Korea, right?” Kang said. “I could have gotten my business career going, but I wanted to try in a bigger pond.” In the end, instead of becoming a CEO, she started her own company, Cognoscente — a healthcare technology company — in 2008. She effectively did what she set out to do, even if she didn’t nail her own timeline. Kang had a plan for the fourth decade, too: giving back and public service. And in 2019, she found women’s soccer. After the U.S. won the 2019 Women’s World Cup, while also fighting for equal pay, there was a reception for the team on Capitol Hill. Tom Daschle, the former Democratic senator from South Dakota, who also served on the Cognoscente board, invited Kang. Daschle would eventually join the Spirit investor group a couple of years later, under the team’s previous ownership. “To tell you the truth, I didn’t know there was a professional league in this country,” Kang told The Athletic in 2022. “In part because my life had been all about work. I didn’t have time to do anything else.” She met Steve Baldwin, then the majority owner of the Spirit, at the reception, along with players and fellow potential investors. By December 2020, she joined as a minority investor with a 35 percent stake in the team. The soccer part was nice, but what appealed to her most was having a hands-on impact on women’s empowerment, especially around pay and equity issues. Four things had helped her through her journey, she said: “Dignity of work, dignity of self, independence and being able to get the same opportunity.” With women’s soccer, she could provide opportunities. But the path to becoming the first woman of color to own a majority stake in the NWSL was not straightforward. In 2021, negotiations for her to gain a controlling stake of the Spirit turned sour between her, Baldwin, and the other primary investor, Bill Lynch. When she made a $35million offer to buy the Spirit in December of that year, it was unheard of for the league. The expansion fee for the Kansas City Current had been a mere $5million; the sale of the majority stake of the Seattle Reign to Lyon in 2019 had been completed at a valuation of $3.51million. Advertisement Those numbers seem quaint now, but the astronomical rise in NWSL team valuations wouldn’t have happened in the same way without that first $35million offer from Kang. Over the past couple of years, her international ambitions came to fruition via a global multi-club organization. It started with a majority stake in Lyon’s women’s team, one of the best European club teams with regular Champions League appearances. Then she snapped up one of the few independent clubs in the top two flights of the English soccer pyramid, the London City Lionesses. The formal announcement of the multi-club organization came this summer, with Kynisca announcing its name and an “innovation hub” focused on the health and performance of women athletes, billed to be the largest of its kind. Kang, via Kynisca, also led a $2million investment in Ida Sports, which designs cleats and shoes for female players, and invested in media company Just Women’s Sports. She also joined the investor group that bought the Baltimore Orioles earlier this year at a $1.725billion valuation. Kang has also branched into other women’s sports with another deal that happened at the Paris Olympics, donating $4million over the next four years to USA Rugby to support the women’s sevens team leading into the 2028 Olympics. USA Rugby called her donation “transformative.” That deal came together even faster than the one with U.S. Soccer. Kang walked into the sold-out Stade de France, surprised by the atmosphere. She ended up next to the chair of USA Rugby and they struck up a conversation. “It was literally the most expensive game I’ve ever been to,” Kang joked Tuesday. “I really did not expect to do that. But I just felt that (the team is) so talented that they should not be deprived of investment and just like what I’ve been trying to do in my own small way, bring attention and hope people begin to see it, and more people will join.”     A post shared by Washington Spirit (@washingtonspirit)  That’s the way Kang usually talks about her larger projects: as some small way of changing the game. But for all the praise she gets, there are still skeptics of her motives and her methods — especially the multi-club model. She’s addressed at least one of those critiques head-on. “I am fully aware of the negative connotation of multi-club (ownership), especially on the men’s side,” Kang said following her purchase of London City. “I will submit to you that on the women’s side, multi-club is a necessity, not luxury or greed. Because we need to invest to professionalize women’s football to the level that they deserve and the potential that women’s football has. We need to invest. Because of the lack of media dollars, there isn’t that much money to invest.” Advertisement After Tuesday’s $30million announcement, it’s harder for critics to accuse Kang of acting in bad faith. Still, she has the edge of ruthlessness regarding business; she wants to make money at this. It’s never been a charity. Instead, she saw an opening and was among the first to leap. She also knows there are risks. Kang doesn’t believe in guaranteed outcomes, just opportunities. “This is a tipping point. Once it happens, it’s on its own trajectory. You can’t stop it,” she said Tuesday. “But we have to make sure we’re investing in the right things at the right time. Otherwise, this could fall apart.” One of those investments is doing just fine. After going to New York City to announce her U.S. Soccer donation, Kang headed to Kansas City to watch her first team, the Spirit, vie for the NWSL championship against the top-seeded Orlando Pride on Saturday night. She’s feeling the nerves, especially after two late winning goals in the playoffs at a sold-out Audi Field. “I kept telling the players after the quarterfinal and the semifinal that at this rate, I don’t think I’m going to live out my natural life span,” Kang said laughing. “I only have one heart.” Pablo Maurer contributed to this report.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Magic's Franz Wagner adds to NBA All-Star case with game-winning 3 over Lakers,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5939985/2024/11/22/franz-wagner-orlando-magic-game-winner/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 12:38:15 GMT",Wagner piled up 37 points and 11 assists along with the dagger in L.A. And it didn't come as a surprise to his teammates or coaches.,"NBA LOS ANGELES — The shot is what fans will remember; Franz Wagner called it the biggest of his young NBA career. For the Orlando Magic, however, the real story is everything that led up to the shot. On Thursday, the Magic’s star forward finished off one of the best games by an Orlando player in recent memory — and possibly wrote his own All-Star origin story — with a game-winning 3-pointer over Cam Reddish with 3.1 seconds left, sending the Magic to a 119-118 win over a Lakers team that had won six straight. FRANZ CALLS GAME@franzboogie https://t.co/KIkC3lwYLt pic.twitter.com/0yat4TOPa1 — Orlando Magic (@OrlandoMagic) November 22, 2024  The shot gave him 37 points on a night when he also had 11 assists, capping the first 35-point, 10-assist outing by a Magic player in more than 20 years. This wasn’t just something that popped out of the blue, though. Talk to the Magic about Wagner’s practice habits, work ethic and approach to the game, and it becomes clear that nobody was surprised by his performance … or that he could carry the team to seven wins in its last eight games during star forward Paolo Banchero’s absence with a torn oblique muscle. Advertisement “He’s been doing this for a while,” Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said. “He’s continued to step into that role where he has to dominate and be the focal point.” It’s not like he hasn’t had big moments before, either. Wagner was a key player on the Germany team that won the 2023 World Cup, hanging 22 on the U.S. in a semifinal win and 19 in the gold medal game against Serbia. But on an NBA stage, this was his breakout moment. So when Anthony Davis left the door open for the Magic by missing two free throws with 18 seconds left, Wagner grabbed the ball from Goga Bitadze, and the other Orlando players got out of the way and watched him operate, trusting the work he’d done to prepare for this. “People talk about good (shot), bad (shot), lucky, unlucky,” Mosley said. “He works on that. That’s the thing, he works on those big shots, 3 … 2 … 1 … take the shot.” Wagner wanted to get a more favorable matchup than having Davis’ monstrous presence on him, so he engineered a switch to get Reddish instead — still a big, long defender. He was originally hoping to probe a pathway to the basket to take advantage of the long-striding finishing skills that have made him a star, but when he didn’t see a clear opening he went for Plan B and got to his stepback going left for the game-winner.   “We were down two, I got lucky with them missing a couple of free throws at the end, and we didn’t have any timeouts,” Wagner said. “At first I had [Anthony Davis] on me, and found a way to push that matchup a little bit. They were set up pretty well, so I didn’t really see any driving lane. “I was thinking best shot (and not just shoot the 3). I would have taken it to the basket too, but I didn’t see any driving lanes, and I was a little taller than Reddish so I tried to shoot over him.” Advertisement But again, don’t focus just on this play and this shot. Instead, look at everything that led up to it, from the work he did in the summer on this 3-point shot, to the first half he spent patiently attacking LA’s defense with skip passes to the weak side, to the end-game situations he rehearsed in practice. And watch him after the shot went in, too: He fist-bumped his chest but then marched to the bench, cold as ice, and pointed a single finger to everyone for one more stop. It was only after Davis’s last shot went awry that he pumped a fist, chest-bumped Jalen Suggs and Jett Howard, and was quickly mobbed by the rest of the bench. The fourth-year forward known as “Boogie” in the locker room has averaged 27.5 points, 6.3 assists and 6.0 rebounds during his last 10 games, all of which came without Banchero. The 37 points were a season high and the 11 assists a career high, but he’s threatened those totals multiple times in the past two weeks — this wasn’t some wild outlier. The story, then, isn’t that this one shot happened to catch net. It’s that the 6-foot-10 forward’s ball skills evolved to the point that he basically operates as the team’s point guard, and that his scoring is so potent that everyone in the building knew he was getting the ball on the final two possessions (he also drove for a layup with 20 seconds left) and he still scored. Nobody understands that more than his older brother, housemate, carpool partner and Magic teammate, Mo Wagner. “He did all right,” the elder Wagner said. “If he’s not making that shot, I’m kicking his a–.” He then added more seriously, “It’s very cool to have a superstar in your family. It’s awesome, the way he works, how determined he is, how diligent he is, how obsessed he is, it’s incredible. The fact I can be able to see it is awesome too.” Advertisement And it was perhaps fitting that he won the game on an off-the-dribble 3-pointer, the one skill that gave him the most trouble during 2023-24 when he slumped to 28.1 percent from distance. That percentage includes a game-tying, last-second attempt in this same building a year ago that was blocked by LeBron James. “A lot of stuff is mental too for us players,” Franz Wagner said. “For me to get over the hump a little bit over the summer and carry that into the season means a lot. “I’ve come a long way since I came into the league, (but) last year was at times a struggle for me. Progress is never just linear; you just gotta stay level-headed.” After the sweet payback of Thursday’s shot, he’s back up to 34.4 percent in 2024-25. And that has come despite Banchero’s absence often leaving him with a more challenging shot mix off the dribble like the one that beat the Lakers. “I do work on my off-the-dribble 3 a lot, and you work on it for those moments,” he said. “I just stepped into it with confidence.” And after that shot, and Jonathan Isaac’s defense to foil a desperation shot by Davis at the buzzer, the Magic team jumped out on the court to celebrate what may end up a defining win for this emerging group … as well as one that helps net Wagner a first All-Star trip. “Yeah, Boogie’s special,” Suggs said. “That was like a movie moment.” “It was a crazy experience, crazy adrenaline rush” Wagner said. “It’s great to see your teammates so happy for you.” (Photo: Ronald Martinez / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Nazir Afzal, who served as Chief Crown Prosecutor for North West England between 2011 and 2015, said “the statistics in sport are as heartbreaking as you can possibly imagine”, and called for governing bodies to self-fund a mechanism through which victims can report their experiences. Advertisement In November, a Premier League footballer accused of rape was further questioned by police, while the English Football Association (FA) also opened a safeguarding inquiry into a separate leading Premier League figure who has previously been investigated by the police for a number of sex offences. Neither can be named for legal reasons. Last month, The Athletic also reported former Fulham Ladies captain Ronnie Gibbons’ allegations that the club’s then-owner Mohamed Al Fayed sexually assaulted her on two separate occasions in 2000. Subsequently, The Athletic also reported on three ex-Fulham Ladies players’ deep concerns that their allegations of sexual abuse at the football club in the 1990s and early 2000s were not properly investigated by the Metropolitan Police or the FA. “Those women were brave to come forward,” says Afzal. “There has been so much silence, and abuse requires silence to happen. There will only be justice if victims speak up and receive the opportunity to document what they experience.” GO DEEPER Mohamed Al Fayed accused of sexually assaulting Fulham Ladies captain at Harrods Speaking on Tuesday afternoon at Women in Sport’s 40th anniversary conference, Afzal argued that one solution was for sport to self-fund an independent safeguarding regulator. “The reality is that we don’t talk enough about abuse,” he said. “We don’t talk about the fact that one in four women will suffer domestic abuse. We don’t talk about the fact that one in five are sexually assaulted. We don’t talk about the fact that more than 3.1 million British adults were sexually abused as children. Those are government figures and that’s the scale of the pandemic. “And the sad thing is, the statistics in sport are as heartbreaking as you can possibly imagine. You have the same issue. People are being silenced. People don’t feel able to speak up. Whistleblowers have faced enormous repercussions as a result of what’s happened to them, and all those things happen simply because they want to speak up. Advertisement “So what do we do differently? The simplest thing is ensuring that you get your voices heard, so regulation is absolutely key. Having a safeguarding regulator is absolutely important. “The smaller (sports) shouldn’t have to pay, but you need an independent agency to provide that level of independent scrutiny as to your performance. That will build public confidence, that will ensure the victims are properly heard.” The proposed Football Governance Bill, which will contain an independent football regulator, currently makes no provision for safeguarding or abuse cases.

Sign up to receive it directly to your inbox. Hello! Robert Lewandowski is still flying — supported by some youngsters on the wings. Oh, and the Premier League is back! On the way: 🗣️ Lewandowski exclusive 🇺🇸 Howard’s Pulisic rebuke 🔧 Reforming MLS Cup play-offs 🤕 Defining ‘an injury crisis’ Robert Lewandowski may be 36 years old, but if you thought he was showing signs of slowing down, you’re seriously mistaken. Barcelona are flying this season. So is their No 9. And he’s been talking exclusively to The Athletic’s Pol Ballus. What’s interesting is the Pole’s significant role in a side of precocious talents from the factory that is La Masia, the club’s academy. He’s 19 years older than Lamine Yamal and Pau Cubarsi and 16 years older than Gavi. Advertisement Perhaps their “more fearless and self-confident nature” is keeping him young, but they will do well to listen to a man who has been a mainstay in an era dominated by Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. His numbers are crazy: 525 goals in 674 games for Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich and Barca, 84 in 156 for Poland, 11 league titles and a Champions League. Only the duo mentioned above have more than Lewandowski’s 99 goals in Europe’s premier competition. You wouldn’t bet against him reaching a century on Tuesday against French side Brest. He should have a Ballon d’Or as well, after he was cruelly robbed when football was curtailed by Covid-19 in 2020. “I think I’ve been close to that elite level (of Messi & Ronaldo) in some moments and even beat them in different games,” he says. “I think we can say I was around!” For sure. Lewandowski’s remarkable 2020 campaign came under head coach Hansi Flick. The pair achieved great success together at Bayern and their union is proving fruitful — Barca’s prolific start to La Liga this season is testament to that. The key ingredient? Communication. “When he tries to explain something, I can understand straight away the way he wants to convince us to play,” Lewandowski says of Flick, who joined Barcelona this summer.  Compare that to his relationship with Xavi, who did not believe he had the pressing ability to lead the line anymore. The Spaniard was later pushed off the plank and, this season, Lewandowski has scored 19 times in 17 games — more than any other player in Europe’s top five leagues. I love that Lewandowski is an old-fashioned No 9. He is lethal and his role at Barcelona fits like a glove. He is in the final year of his contract, which has a clause that will trigger a another season if he plays more than 50 per cent of minutes in the 2024-25 campaign. Barring injury, he is going to do that. “I feel that I am where I dreamt to be, in the right place with the right people,” he says. 📲 LIVE coverage of Ruben Amorim’s first press conference as Manchester United head coach is here. My mouth is still ajar following the shock exit of Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami from the MLS Cup. Upsets are not necessarily a bad thing, of course, but the format of the event — which continues this weekend — remains deeply flawed. Don’t fret though, Jeff Rueter is at hand with his proposal to reform the play-offs. Advertisement He suggests MLS should introduce an initial group stage: two sets of eight, split into east and west, with teams seeded based on their regular season placement, which feeds into a knockout bracket. The benefits are pretty straightforward: Real Madrid have eight injuries in their squad. Premier League clubs are suffering, too. But when does it become a ‘crisis’? We asked resident football language expert Adam Hurrey (aka Football Cliches)… An injury crisis is unlike any other club crisis. It doesn’t, surprisingly, trigger a cracked-badge graphic on the back page of a tabloid newspaper, but it can nonetheless derail a club’s season. But what’s the casualty threshold for a true injury crisis? Injury crises tend to unfold over two to three weeks, but to be beyond the realms of merely “injury-hit”, a club must have no fewer than eight players on the proverbial treatment table at the same time (that is, around a third of a registered 25-man Premier League squad), but this isn’t just about numbers. An injury crisis must traditionally deprive a manager of all of their “recognised” centre-backs or centre-forwards, leading to the indignity of a makeshift option (a central midfielder dropping back or a flimsy winger deployed aimlessly as a No 9). At this point, managers talk in viscerally basic terms of getting “bodies” back to revive a squad that, in Redknappian terms, is “down to the bare bones”.

As you may have seen, Spurs this week introduced a really different brand new club logo. At the same time, they have also remastered the famous Spurs font, expanded the text to include new widths and introduced a new palette of supporting colours. These are true actual words from their website. GO DEEPER Spurs have 'remastered' their 'brand identity' - but what does that actually mean?

Never been done before. Not by Wolves, whose simple wolf head badge was introduced four years earlier in 2002. Not by Liverpool who switched to a simple Liver Bird in, erm, 1955. To be fair to the Club (sic) of firsts, they have managed a few lately like giving Ipswich Town and Crystal Palace their first victories of the season, am I right? Lads, it’s a cockerel, it looks absolutely fine, just stick it on the shirt and say no more about it. Tottenham Hotspur announce their new logo! ⚪ pic.twitter.com/1zaIoLStLX — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) November 18, 2024  Luckily, Row Z has obtained an exclusive transcript from the brand executive meeting where the idea was conceived. Brand exec 1: “Right, it’s been nine months of work, we’ve spoken to 300 fans, staff and players and it’s crunch time, we need to finalise the new logo. “Remember, the remit is; it needs to nod to the club’s proud history and look to its bright future while being bold, original, striking, inoffensive, woke, non-woke, right-wing, left-wing and vegan-friendly. “Any ideas, team? What have we got?” ***silence in the room*** Brand exec 2: “Well, I did have one idea. How about… and bear with me here…we keep it exactly the same as it was before, but we get rid of the name?” Brand exec 1: “I like it.” Brand exec 2: “Yeah? You don’t think we should come up with something more complex and intricate to reflect the amount they’re paying us for almost a year’s worth of work? Brand exec 1: “No that’s it, that’s literally perfect.” Brand exec 2: “Great! Done by lunchtime. Big 10 me brother!” Brand exec 1: “YES!” Brand exec 2: “God, we’re good.” Brand exec 1: “It’s what we do.” Brand exec 2: “It’s just what we do.” Brand exec 1: “And to dare is to do, am I right?!” Advertisement Brand exec 2: “Yeah, and also, to dare is to don’t change much? It totally works.” Brand exec 1: “Soya matcha green tea cream frappuccino blended beverage to celebrate?” Brand exec 2: “You read my mind.” For PR guff, Spurs have still got absolutely nothing on FIFA who this week unveiled a trophy for the Club World Cup, the competition no one wants to play in or watch. If you were designing a trophy for a football competition and wanted to draw on some inspiration you might think of iconic players, maybe? Or matches. Perhaps stadiums. Not FIFA. They’ve looked to the periodic table, astronomy and space travel’s historic Voyager Golden Records. Nope, no idea. That’s like saying the shiny-topped World Cup globe trophy was inspired by the glistening round head of MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace. “Every glint of gold reflects the relentless pursuit of greatness,” FIFA said of the prize for the Club World Cup, a competition which will feature the Inter Miami who were literally handed a place just because Lionel Messi is in their team. Maybe they’re in for the pursuit of marketing greatness? The trophy is here! ✨ Crafted in collaboration with @TiffanyAndCo, this trophy will be awarded for the first time to the winners of the inaugural #FIFACWC taking place next year. #TakeItToTheWorld pic.twitter.com/x1Wo1T1Lf4 — FIFA Club World Cup (@FIFACWC) November 14, 2024  The trophy includes wording in 13 languages (but not Welsh) and preserves “club football’s heritage for generations to come”. Shame no one will be able to watch the heritage unfold with no broadcaster yet willing to stump up the cash to screen it. Anyway, the best thing about the trophy is two engravings dedicated to president Gianni Infantino, including one line which says the tournament was inspired by him, which is a bit like Infantino having ‘inspired by Adam and Eve’ tattooed on his left buttock. Talking of a waste of time and money, Neymar’s injured again. The Brazilian has barely played for Al Hilal since joining last year with a host of injury problems, which, to be fair, sound pretty horrendous (he spoke this week of being tempted to retire). Still, there is a silver lining for Neymar in the form of his bank account. Al Hilal are believed to have paid around £80million ($100m) to buy him from Paris Saint-Germain and are reported to be paying the 32-year-old £90m ($112m) a season, plus a mansion, a fleet of luxury cars and a private jet. Given he’s played just seven times for Al Hilal (one goal, three assists) and for 438 minutes in total, that works out as costing the club around £2m ($2.5m) per minute so far. Which kind of puts in perspective getting enraged by being overcharged for that oat latte you bought this morning (OK, just me). We might think the Premier League is getting worse for dark arts, but it’s still child’s play compared to South America. Venezuela hosted Brazil in an important World Cup qualifier last week and they really, really needed a result. Really. Venezuela are the only nation in South American qualifying to have never reached a World Cup, but they’re in with a chance this time and were desperate to cling on to a point. Advertisement It was 1-1 deep into stoppage time — and, bear in mind, Venezuela were already down to 10 men and had saved a Brazil penalty — when Brazil had a corner. The home team managed to clear it, but to ensure that there was absolutely no way Brazil were about to score, someone did this… Venezuela set off the water sprinklers to stop a Brazil attack in injury time 🤣🤣  pic.twitter.com/VHlAaK08ey — Swearing Sports News (@SwearingSport) November 16, 2024  It was the kind of top-level s***housery that Neal Maupay would stand and applaud. So when the opposition goalkeeper feigns injury this weekend to get a little tactics break for their team, just remember it could be a lot worse. GO DEEPER Infuriating, embarrassing - and funny: What players really think of 'shithousing' And finally, this week, if you’re having a bad day or you’re a bit down in the dumps, just remember that, unlike Bradford City’s Lewis Richards, at least your bad day isn’t happening live in front of thousands of people. Or a few hundred thousand more who have watched this clip.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How the Edmonton Oilers' prospect pipeline is growing stronger at centre,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938013/2024/11/22/edmonton-oilers-prospect-pipeline-centre/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 12:00:22 GMT",It's clear that centre is a position of strength for the Oilers in the NHL and at all levels of the system.,"NHL Stanley Cup-winning teams are inevitably built “up the spine” with impact centres, goaltenders and defencemen. For the Edmonton Oilers, the centre position has been occupied by Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl for most of the last decade, with Ryan Nugent-Hopkins in the middle for years before spending more time on the wing in recent seasons. Advertisement That’s the kind of quality up the middle every NHL team covets. As McDavid, Draisaitl and Nugent-Hopkins age, it’s important for the team to restock the position. For new general manager Stan Bowman, the age in this group (Nugent-Hopkins and Adam Henrique are past 30, and fourth-line centre Derek Ryan is 37) is a warning sign. The team needs young players, on inexpensive contracts, ready to take over. As it happens, the Oilers have quality marbled through each level of the system. Edmonton’s NHL depth chart at centre is so strong that head coach Kris Knoblauch routinely runs one or more pivots on the wing. This is a ridiculous depth chart. The 31 other NHL teams would move heaven and earth to approach this level of elite quality and depth. The group is aging, and in the case of Nugent-Hopkins and Henrique time on left wing has increased in recent seasons. Both men have had a tough time scoring this season, and both have played poorly for stretches. This happens over a long season, and the erosion of talent can’t be dismissed as a possible reason. Still, the organization should be able to ride this group to a Stanley Cup victory next spring without a tweak. Edmonton sent away two young centres with strong NHL futures over the summer in Ryan McLeod and Dylan Holloway. That’s a significant loss of talent in one position over a short period. The Oilers added Henrique via free agency (he was their own free agent after a deadline deal) and then deemed Ryan capable of another year in the middle. Management didn’t plan on Noah Philp having a strong impact during training camp and preseason, but his emergence as a viable NHL recall was welcome news. The Bakersfield Condors have had injuries at the position this season, but Philp is delivering strong results in the AHL. Advertisement At even strength, his goal share (8-5, 62 percent) is well clear of the other Condors when Philp is off the ice (25-29, 46 percent). These are small samples but Philp delivered even stronger numbers two years ago as an AHL rookie. At this level, he’s an even-strength difference-maker. An NHL recall has already happened, and another one appears imminent. There’s a chance Philp won’t see Bakersfield again the next time he flies to Edmonton. The other young centre worth mentioning is Jayden Grubbe. He’s a little younger (21) and has had some ups and downs this season but plays a rugged style and makes his presence known. Through the first 14 games of the season, he has just four assists (all at even strength) and owns an even-strength goal share of 47 percent (7-8). That includes a difficult recent run (4-7 over the last several games) but Grubbe’s rookie year was successful in this area. He has been playing with Seth Griffith at times in more of a feature role as the Condors coaching staff is doing a fine job of marbling youth and experience across the roster. There’s no hurry for Philp or Grubbe. Nugent-Hopkins and Henrique are signed long-term to play behind McDavid and Draisaitl. The Philp surge allows the team to look for an internal option in case of injury or a veteran (like Ryan) falters. Both AHL prospects are right-handed centres, win battles and possess a range of skills. Sam O’Reilly is years from making his NHL debut, but his skill set is ideal for the organization. A right-handed centre with all the tools, he was regarded as a strong draft option by both Corey Pronman and Scott Wheeler at The Athletic in the days leading up to the 2024 draft. Pronman used words like “two-way center, competes hard and has physicality; quality skill and vision and can create chances” while Wheeler wrote “natural center,  plus-level skater and athlete. He projects as a potential well-rounded, complementary pro.” Advertisement O’Reilly isn’t scoring at elite levels but is productive in all three game states for the OHL London Knights this season. On the power play (0-3-3) and penalty kill (1-1-2) his offence is getting results, and he’s now over three shots per game. At even strength, O’Reilly is a little shy in scoring (3-4-7 in 18 games). On the other hand, he owns a five-on-five goal share (13-7, 65 percent) that’s far superior to the Knights attack when he’s off the ice. With O’Reilly on the bench during even-strength play, the Knights are 39-32, 55 percent. The OHL doesn’t publish time on ice rates, but O’Reilly is involved in all three game situations and having a 200-foot impact at even strength. It’s difficult to shine on an elite team as an even-strength outscorer, but O’Reilly is delivering on draft-day promise. Edmonton’s amateur scouts deserve praise for O’Reilly, while the addition of William Nicholl in the seventh round looks like a stroke of genius. Nicholl didn’t play much for London in his draft year, and it’s easy for NHL scouts to miss talent due to lack of playing time. Nicholl is a “draft and follow” pick, so named because no one was quite sure what to expect. There’s no strong resume. So far this season, Nicholl is thriving with his minutes. Here’s a look at how much damage he’s doing this year compared to last season. Nicholl is on fire in the OHL, generally regarded as the world’s best junior league. The only ways for a true talent to fall in the NHL Draft from the OHL are injury and lack of exposure to scouts. Oilers scouts saw him good. We’re a long way from calling Nicholl a home run, but a recently chosen prospect (from the seventh round) who’s third in team scoring is notable. He’s rolling with top-end talent and the play isn’t dying on his stick. As we get closer to our December top 20 prospects list, it’s clear goaltending and centre are positions of strength for the organization. Advertisement Fans worried about O’Reilly’s early offensive production can be heartened by his even-strength outscoring and the low percentage of his offence that’s coming from the power play. The Knights aren’t feeding him cherry minutes, and even-strength points are tougher. His penalty killing prowess is another bullet point on the resume. Nicholl’s offensive explosion is both impressive and a small sample. It should be recognized as a big step forward but needs to be seen over the entire season. Among the two AHL centres who are considered prospects of note, it’s Philp who’s pushing for NHL work this season. After a year away from pro hockey, his performance is impressive.

Good morning! Play in the snow today.  I don’t think we can say last night’s Browns–Steelers game was the best of the NFL season. Was it my favorite, though? Absolutely, for two incredible reasons: Last night felt like the Super Bowl for the 3-8 home team, while the division suddenly gets more interesting with Pittsburgh slipping to 8-3. Can we play every game in the snow? Also, some overnight news: The Athletic’s Andrew Marchand reported that Jason Kelce will host a late-night TV talk show on ESPN for five weeks starting Jan. 4. Imagine the traditional late-night show, make it about sports and run it through the Kelce filter during the NFL playoffs. Voila. I asked Andrew if he thinks it’ll land:  “I don’t think Jason Kelce will be this generation’s David Letterman, but could this turn into another Pat McAfee-type show? Maybe. At 1 a.m., no one is picking up huge Nielsen numbers, but the point for ESPN is to be younger and cooler on social media and YouTube. It’s worth a shot.” Read the full report here.

Brutal news out of Washington, where NHL legend Alex Ovechkin — who had been enjoying a sparkling season — will miss the next four to six weeks with a fractured left fibula.

Which teams are being underrated? Plus, the game of the weekend.","NCAAM Let’s get straight to the good stuff. “Game of the season” — even this early on — is not a superlative I hand out lightly. But there’s just no other way to describe Baylor’s 99-98 double-overtime win against St. John’s on Thursday night. It was the exact kind of palpitation-inducing, stand-up-and-scream-at-your-TV game that makes college basketball so fun. Advertisement For any of you poor souls who either A) were watching another eye-bleeder of a “Thursday Night Football” game, or B) went to bed early, St. John’s stormed out to an 18-point first-half lead. Rick Pitino’s team basically could not miss. But then Baylor, mostly behind Norchad Omier’s bully ball, plus a combination of Jeremy Roach and Jayden Nunn jumpers, chipped away. Finally, with under three minutes left in regulation, the Bears took their first lead of the night. Roach — the Duke transfer, and one of Baylor’s three high-profile additions this offseason — stepped to the line for a one-and-one that would ice the game, only to miss the first free throw, allowing Kadary Richmond enough time to hit a teardrop at the other end and send the game to overtime. After a back-and-forth slog, Baylor led by five with 1:36 left. Then Richmond, who by this point was limping, went back into takeover mode, scoring five straight to force a second overtime. Which is when things got really fun. St. John’s hit three of its eventual 14 3-pointers in double OT, and after the teams traded baskets, the Johnnies still led by five with 18 seconds left. The win was all but guaranteed. Then VJ Edgecombe — Baylor’s five-star freshman guard, playing back in his native Bahamas — drained a prayer of a 3 with six seconds left to make it a one-possession game. Baylor fouled on the ensuing inbounds, and after Zuby Ejiofor, who finished with a team-high 22 points and 10 rebounds, missed both free throws, it left Roach enough time to hit the winner: JEREMY ROACH FOR THE WIN! Baylor stuns St. John's in double overtime!pic.twitter.com/EsBVde7711 — Heat Check CBB (@HeatCheckCBB) November 22, 2024    For St. John’s, it’s a tough loss, but Pitino’s team, in the long run, is going to be just fine. Richmond — who finished with 14 points, seven assists and four rebounds — still doesn’t look totally comfortable, which should be nightmare fuel for the rest of the Big East. And Scott Drew’s Baylor squad has rebounded as well as possible from that opening night disaster against Gonzaga. The Bears still have plenty to clean up, but the offseason additions of Roach and Omier — who combined for 44 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists, including half of Baylor’s points in the two overtime periods — are clearly paying off. Advertisement I’ll take a rematch of that one in March, please. Let’s start with the latter of the two — Kam Jones’ 17-point, 13-rebound, 10-assist masterpiece vs. Purdue. Not only was this the first triple-double by any Marquette player since Dwyane Wade in the 2003 Elite Eight, but it was Jones’ first career game with either 10 rebounds or 10 assists. So, truly a breakout effort, the kind that puts the country on notice and puts Jones in any way-too-early National Player of the Year conversations. We would also be remiss not to mention that this was Jones’ first game since learning of the death of his old high school coach, and it’s beautiful that he dedicated a night like that to someone he held so dear. Jones led Marquette in scoring the past two seasons, but can we talk about his passing? The 6-foot-4 senior had never averaged more than 2.4 assists per game for a season, but he’s more than doubled that as a senior, with six dimes a night. He’s averaging a career-high 22.6 points per game, tied for the sixth-most amongst high-major players. Purdue cut its deficit to three points early in the second half, at which points Jones scored or assisted on six of Marquette’s next seven successful possessions. He started out with this feed: Then this ridiculous, contorting finish: And finally an, “LOL try to stop me” pick-and-roll layup: All of that before he scored eight of Marquette’s last 13 points, to put the game on ice. You’re going to be hearing a lot more about Jones this season — and Marquette, for that matter. The Golden Eagles have been one of the most fun teams to watch the first month. But that other triple-double that caught my eye? The one that, at least nationally, hasn’t gotten nearly the love? Jaland Lowe going for 11 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists against VMI on Monday. I get that the caliber of competition isn’t the same, but look at this dime. There just aren’t many guards in the country capable of making a cross-court, one-handed (Lowe is a lefty, so this is at least his dominant hand) pass through three defenders off a live dribble: And as for Pitt, fun fact: The Panthers are one of just 12 teams, as of this writing, with a top-25 adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency rating, per KenPom. The others include the top four teams in the country, plus six other ranked squads. But Jeff Capel’s team isn’t being talked about in nearly the same light, despite already owning two top-100 wins. Maybe that’s because the Panthers don’t have a singular star. Ish Leggett, who won ACC Sixth Man of the Year last season, has been the most consistent scorer, and college journeyman Damian Dunn has rediscovered his old form. (He played four seasons at Temple and a fifth at Houston). Advertisement With three straight high-major foes on the docket, we’re about to find out just how “for real” Pitt is, but as of today, I feel confident saying the Panthers are the ACC’s third-best team, behind only Duke and North Carolina. Marquette and Pitt aren’t the only teams I’ve been impressed with that still aren’t getting the love they probably should be. Three others: Xavier: Wake Forest beat Michigan, and Xavier beat Wake Forest … but it’s Michigan that’s ranked? Huh? The rankings will work themselves out, but Sean Miller’s squad is easily my pick for “most aesthetically pleasing” team. The Musketeers just play a gorgeous, modern version of basketball; they’re leading the nation in assist rate, at 77.3 percent. Yes, the most-experienced high-major team in America shares the ball well. They are 13th in 3-point percentage, with Indiana State transfer Ryan Conwell leading the way at a blistering 52.6 percent on 7.6 attempts per game. Among Xavier, Marquette, Creighton and UConn, the top of the Big East is gonna be a bloodbath. Inject it straight into my veins. Texas Tech: Before Thursday night’s loss to Saint Joe’s — shout out to the Hawks, who also beat Villanova — I can’t remember the last time a team rated so favorably by KenPom was unranked entirely. Texas Tech is a victim of the dreaded “ain’t played nobody” affliction that so many teams deal with in nonconference play, but UConn, Iowa State, Creighton and Cincinnati haven’t either. I’m not excusing Thursday’s one-point loss, which came via a free throw in the final 15 seconds, but I’m still buying all the stock I can in Grant McCasland’s team. New Mexico transfer JT Toppin has been a star — he had 22 points and 18 rebounds on Thursday night — and ranks fifth in KenPom’s NPOY rankings, a deserved placement for one of the best glass-cleaners in America. The Red Raiders went cold from 3 for the first time against the Hawks, but there’s more than enough depth here to compete with the Big 12’s best. Indiana: Ranked 16th nationally and tops of any Big Ten team, Indiana isn’t getting totally disrespected, but should we be talking about this team in an even loftier light? Mackenzie Mgbako has looked incredible, especially as a supersized 3-man next to Oumar Ballo and Malik Reneau; he was really the swing guy for IU this season, because if he couldn’t stretch the floor, this whole experiment might not have worked. Mackenzie Mgbako scored in a lot of different ways last night vs SIUE 31 points and 9 rebounds on 13/17 shooting, 4/5 from 3pt range pic.twitter.com/pVFfMyXQBi — ᗩᑎT ᗯᖇIGᕼT (@itsAntWright) November 7, 2024  Mgbako won’t shoot 63.6 percent from 3 all season, but between his deep shooting and his interior finishing, he’s been an ideal fit between those aforementioned bigs and Myles Rice. The Washington State transfer has been similarly awesome, albeit a little turnover-prone. I put Indiana right there with Purdue and Illinois as my Big Ten favorites, and it’s entirely possible Mike Woodson’s team rises into the top 10 if it wins the Battle 4 Atlantis next week. It’s not time for a full-throated discussion about Alabama — the Crimson Tide just dropped 100 points on No. 25 Illinois, and that was with preseason All-American Mark Sears sitting basically the last 12 minutes — but something just doesn’t seem totally right about Nate Oats’ team. “So you think Alabama sucks, huh?” Sigh. No. But for a team that had a reasonable case to be No. 1 in the preseason, with a returning All-American, three incoming top-35 recruits and a high-profile transfer big, the pieces haven’t all fit quite like expected. Advertisement Obviously, some of that goes back to Sears, who — according to Oats — asked not to be put back into the Illinois game because his teammates were playing so well. That’s noble, and about the best thing a legitimate leader can do. But his struggles are the reason that was even plausible. Here’s Sears’ shot chart from last season, per CBB Analytics:  Vs. his shot chart so far this year:  Sears isn’t hitting his above the break 3s at nearly a similar rate as last season. His 44 percent mark on such 3s last season ranked in the 94th percentile nationally; presently, his 30 percent rate is in the 48th percentile, or about half what it was. Sears is too good a shooter to struggle like this all season, and I’d comfortably bet on him and Oats rectifying those woes. But I’m more interested in Sears’s struggles at the rim. He was in the 99th percentile last season in shots at the rim, with 5.6 per game, but he’s getting to the cup only 3.2 times a night this year — and he hasn’t been particularly effective when he has, shooting almost seven percent below the national average in such situations. As for the team at large, the issue seems pretty simple: Alabama just isn’t shooting it as well. Last season: 37.3 percent from 3, 77.2 percent on free throws. This season? 30.8 percent from 3, 71.4 percent on free throws. Given the way Oats wants to play, there’s always going to be some shot variance with the Crimson Tide’s results — usually in a good way — but four Bama players had career-best 3-point seasons last year. That simply hasn’t matriculated. (Jarin Stevenson, who canned five 3s vs. UNC in the Sweet 16, is 0-for-16.) I’ve said before that I’m a big believer in the law of averages, and Alabama is going to be fine, but it might be more of a “very good team that can make the Final Four” than “elite team that should be a national title front-runner.” Same, same … but different. Alabama’s tough nonconference schedule
  Duke at Arizona. C’mon. Another chance for Caleb Love to play the Blue Devils? It’s delicious. Because I’m clearly feeling list-y, the three things I’m most watching for (live from the McKale Center) are: How does Khaman Maluach combat Arizona’s versatile frontcourt? Duke’s 7-foot-2 center has been solid — 9.5 points, seven rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game — but Tommy Lloyd can throw multiple looks at the freshman. Tennessee transfer Tobe Awaka has been an absolute monster on the glass — he’s top 10 in both offensive and defensive rebounding rate, per KenPom — but he’s only 6-foot-8. Then there’s Motiejus Krivas, the 7-foot-2 Lithuanian, one of the few players in the sport who can physically match Maluach, but he’s played only 13.3 minutes per game while rehabbing an offseason ankle injury. Maluach doesn’t have to carry the interior load alone, Maliq Brown and Cooper Flagg will both be in the mix, but how the freshman responds in a road environment could be crucial. Advertisement Will we get Good or Bad Caleb Love? Love in Arizona’s first two games: 13.5 points, 3.5 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game, while shooting 45.8 percent overall and 38.5 percent from 3 (on 13 attempts). Love against Wisconsin: 6 points, two rebounds, two assists, while shooting (hold your nose) 15.4 percent overall and missing all six 3-point attempts. Oh, and he fouled out in 25 minutes. Duke knows Love, and it has to hope it doesn’t get the guy who has averaged 16.9 points vs. Duke in eight career games. Which team hits 3s? Outside of its loss to Kentucky, Duke has made 11, 17 and 16 3-pointers in its three wins (all against sub-150 ranked teams). Arizona, meanwhile, has made 20 3-pointers all season, shooting an abysmal 27.4 percent from deep. That would easily be the worst of any of Lloyd’s Arizona teams. KJ Lewis and Trey Townsend, especially, need to get going in that regard, or it’s tough to see how Arizona has the scoring to keep up with a Duke team averaging 88.5 per game. For that last reason especially, give me Duke, even on the road. Plus, it’s only poetic that if Love got the last laugh against Mike Krzyzewski three seasons ago, Duke gets one final win against him.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Shedeur Sanders' recruiting pitch to bring talent to Colorado is playing out as promised,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938065/2024/11/22/colorado-football-shedeur-sanders-deion/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 11:05:56 GMT","To get to where they are now, the Buffs needed much more. The quarterback, teammates say, knew it, which is why he went to work.","NCAAF BOULDER, Colo. — Terrell Timmons Jr. was, like so many now, sold on the grandiose vision. The transfer wide receiver was convinced Colorado would make a stunning charge toward a conference title not just because of the Buffs’ famous coach — but powered by his new quarterback, Shedeur Sanders. Sanders had a direct hand in swaying many key players to take the risk. Advertisement “Two is going to take us there,” Timmons said before the start of the season. A guarantee that, at the time, could’ve seemed a smidge idealistic. But three months on, Colorado is not hard to find at 8-2, ranked No. 16 in the College Football Playoff rankings and in control of its own destiny in the shortening race toward a Big 12 Championship Game appearance. A Colorado win over Kansas on Saturday inside Arrowhead Stadium combined with No. 16 BYU beating No. 21 Arizona State on the road and Utah beating No. 22 Iowa State at home Saturday would clinch the Buffaloes a shot at the conference crown. They can also get there by winning out, including against Oklahoma State on Black Friday.  Yes, the Buffaloes are headlined by their effervescent head coach, Deion Sanders, the Heisman Trophy front-runner in two-way rarity Travis Hunter — and their quarterback. Shedeur Sanders is a pretentious lightning rod to some, a celebrity athlete with a celebrity father to others, and is in contention to be the first quarterback selected in next year’s NFL Draft. He has thrown for 3,222 yards and 27 touchdowns and seven interceptions through the first 10 games and is completing 72.9 percent of his passes, tied for second place in the FBS with Ohio State’s Will Howard. GO DEEPER If Shedeur Sanders wants to be drafted No. 1, he needs to act like it But to get to where they are now, the Buffaloes needed much more. Shedeur, teammates say, knew it, which is why he went to work. Beyond the endless reels of social media interview clips, beyond being one of the most efficient quarterbacks in college football for a second consecutive season, perhaps Shedeur Sanders’ most impressive feat was his role in aiding in building this Buffs roster. His stardom helped lure a likely successor, too. On Thursday, Colorado landed a commitment from five-star quarterback Julian “JuJu” Lewis, a former USC commit. During Lewis’ first visit this summer to Boulder, he posed in a Colorado uniform on a gold throne as Shedeur handed him a set of keys, signifying what he would be inheriting. Advertisement Deion Sanders made no bones about flipping rosters if something isn’t up to snuff. He’s cleaned house at a historic rate. And after a humbling 4-8 season in 2023, Colorado had no choice but to beef up its offensive line and add to an already talented wide receivers group that featured Hunter, Jimmy Horn Jr. and Omarion Miller. Shedeur Sanders went recruiting, too. Timmons said Shedeur reached out on social media to gauge interest after Timmons entered the portal from NC State last December. “I would say 2’s approach is a very pro-mindset,” Timmons said when asked to describe working with him now on a day-to-day basis. “He’s very detailed with everything he does in the film room, on the field, off the field, everything. He’s very intelligent. You can tell he really looks up to Tom Brady with just the way he moves and operates.” When former Ohio State running back Dallan Hayden was in Boulder on his official visit after entering the portal in April, Hayden said Shedeur wanted to sit down with him and explain what this year’s offense would need. In January, Shedeur came across tape of former FAU wide receiver LaJohntay Wester, who had entered the portal a few weeks earlier. “I pulled up his film, and I was recruiting him myself,” Shedeur said in April. “I pulled it up myself and was like, ‘Nah, we need this guy. This is the guy we want, this is the guy we need on the field.’” Like his dad, Shedeur sold Wester on the vision of what it could look like if it all came together in Boulder. In his first year with the Buffaloes, Wester has nine total touchdowns and has been one of most dynamic receivers in the conference. In last week’s 49-24 win over Utah, Wester had a 76-yard punt return for a touchdown. “He’s just a complete quarterback,” Wester said of Shedeur last month. “I’m glad to be on his side.” Another new wideout, former Vanderbilt transfer Will Sheppard, caught two touchdowns against Utah. At 6-foot-3, Sheppard is Shedeur’s most physically imposing receiver, an ideal complement to the all-around skill of Hunter and the speed of Wester and Horn. While the receiving corps was boosted in the offseason, Hunter remains Shedeur’s go-to option. Hunter leads the team with 74 receptions, 911 yards receiving and nine receiving touchdowns. Advertisement The pair spoke of the chemistry they’ve developed earlier this month on Shedeur’s podcast “2Legendary.” “You’ve just got to have that brotherly bond, even outside of football,” Hunter said. “If you trust me outside of football, of course you’re going to trust me on the field.” For this pass-happy offense to reach its apex, more trust was needed elsewhere, too. As stellar as the second year in Boulder has been for Shedeur, the first was equally maddening. Despite being one of the most efficient quarterbacks in the country and having a 27-to-4 touchdown-to-interception ratio, he was also the most sacked quarterback in college football. He was sacked 52 times in 11 starts. Shedeur called former Indiana right tackle Kahlil Benson after he went into the transfer portal last November to introduce himself. That same day, former UTEP guard Justin Mayers went into the transfer portal, and he had five missed calls from the same number. The guy who kept trying him? His future quarterback. A few months after he signed at Colorado, Mayers posted a video on his own YouTube channel of Colorado’s offensive linemen snowmobiling in the mountains above Breckenridge, Colo., with Shedeur. One of those linemen was former five-star left tackle Jordan Seaton, who jokingly jumped out of his blocking stance shin-deep in snow with Shedeur laughing nearby. Shedeur, Seaton has said in various interviews, was one of the main reasons he chose the Buffaloes. As the race for Seaton’s signature heated up last December with other high-profile programs vying for his talent, Shedeur FaceTimed Seaton showing off his pricey diamond necklace and said, “We can shine together.” Seaton was a mandatory blindside addition for the Buffaloes to try to keep Sanders upright. Still, the Buffaloes rank 94th in allowed pressure rate in 2024 (33.6 percent), only slightly better than last year’s brutal year in which they were 110th (36.7 percent). Shedeur and the line also have allowed 31 sacks through 10 games, which is 17 fewer sacks than this point a year ago. Advertisement Seaton said Shedeur’s desire to dissect defenses from the pocket and not overreacting to mistakes has helped his learning curve as a true freshman left tackle. “Having a calm quarterback makes me more calm,” Seaton said last month. “It’s like Mike and Ike with me and Shedeur.” Clint Trickett knows the range of Shedeur’s magnetism. Now Georgia Southern’s pass-game coordinator, Trickett recruited Shedeur while an assistant at Florida Atlantic four years ago. Before Shedeur joined his dad when Sanders took the Jackson State job in September 2020, Shedeur had committed to FAU. “You want to have a quarterback who is your lead recruiter and who is that driving force, but at the same time, to have one that makes people want to come play with him, that’s not common,” Trickett said. “Most quarterbacks are all about going and getting it, but most don’t have the star power to bring them in the boat. That’s what makes him special.” Colorado’s ambitious plan is working. Yet Shedeur’s approach to leadership has been called into question by some. After Colorado was smoked by Nebraska in Week 2, his postgame comments about being sacked five times in comparison to none taken by Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola appeared to some like he was pointing blame at his own offensive line. In September, The Athletic’s Jim Trotter spoke to two former NFL general managers about how Shedeur’s personality and leadership style may impact how he’s viewed throughout the rigorous draft process. “The stuff about the comments and things like that, people will worry about that a little bit, but the work ethic is the thing,” one former GM said. On the first play of the game against Utah last week, Shedeur telegraphed a pass that was intercepted. He responded by going 30 of 40 for 340 yards, three touchdowns and completed 73 percent of his passes. Critical of himself afterward, Shedeur said he needed to “take over a little bit more” and was going to apologize to the rest of the offense. Advertisement “I can’t put the team in that type of situation,” he said. “I’m thankful for the defense. I may need to take them out to dinner this week for saving me and saving the team.” His father has routinely said that if Shedeur is given adequate protection from his offensive line, he is good enough to win games with his talent. Deion recently said he will “privately” have a hand in which teams draft Shedeur and Hunter, speaking specifically to Shedeur on FS1’s “Speak” sports show, he wants an organization “that can handle the quarterback he is.” The duo strolls the sidelines together before every game as Deion bestows advice on his son. “Show them who you are,” he said before the win over Utah. Shedeur has been known to clap back at those who speak disparagingly of the Buffaloes or flaunt any number of his ritzy possessions — diamond-encrusted watches, cars, you name it — in the general direction of detractors. Teammates say they don’t see that side of him as being a true representation of who he is. They chose to listen to what Shedeur Sanders was pitching because it’s playing out just the way he said it could. Or, in the parlance of his father, the way it always would. “You know, he’s all on social media and famous, but he’s really a normal person,” Timmons said. “He’s not Hollywood. He’s a normal person like me and you. He’s just really good at what he does.”  (Top photo: Dustin Bradford / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Wisconsin-Nebraska game keys and prediction: Can offense break free after firing OC?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938552/2024/11/22/wisconsin-football-nebraska-prediction/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 11:05:55 GMT","Could the Badgers introduce enough tweaks on short notice to again create meaningful change, even if just for a game?","NCAAF The last time Wisconsin’s football team took the field for a game following an in-season firing of its coach, an unshackled offense successfully unveiled new wrinkles during a 42-7 drubbing of Northwestern. That was only two years ago — six days after head coach Paul Chryst was fired — when the staff under interim coach Jim Leonhard devised a plan that utilized its quarterback in a different way against an opponent on a four-game losing streak. Graham Mertz completed 7 of 10 passes off play-action for two touchdowns after throwing off play-action just nine times through the first five games. He also completed all nine of his passes out of the pistol formation, which the Badgers had not run once all season. Wisconsin threw six touchdowns in a game for the first time in program history. Advertisement Of course, that Northwestern team finished 1-11 and was far worse than the 5-5 Nebraska team Wisconsin, also 5-5, will face on Saturday. While Nebraska enters the matchup on a four-game losing streak, the Cornhuskers do have wins against bowl-eligible Rutgers and a Colorado team vying for a College Football Playoff spot. They also have more to play for, with one more victory clinching their first bowl game in eight years. But the parallel, on the heels of Wisconsin’s firing Sunday of offensive coordinator Phil Longo, remains. Could the Badgers introduce enough tweaks on short notice to again create meaningful change, even if just for a game? Or will it be more of the same in what has been yet another underwhelming season offensively? “I’m not going to say what our plan is, but we have a plan,” Badgers center Jake Renfro said. “It’s a really good plan, and we’re all super excited to show the world on Saturday.” 𝐆𝐀𝐌𝐄 1️⃣1️⃣ 🆚 Nebraska📆 Saturday, Nov. 23⏰ 2:30 PM CT🏟️ Memorial Stadium📺 Big Ten Network pic.twitter.com/4b7onYxTr3 — Wisconsin Football (@BadgerFootball) November 18, 2024  Here are three questions Wisconsin can answer Saturday, plus a prediction: Wisconsin isn’t likely to significantly stray from the concepts Longo introduced. But with tight ends coach Nate Letton and wide receivers coach Kenny Guiton shouldering more responsibility, the unit does figure to look at least somewhat different. Paring down the plan while better taking advantage of the players’ strengths will be critical. Wisconsin’s offensive line needs to spearhead the charge in a matchup against a Nebraska team with a top-20 run defense. Creating a push up front for running backs Tawee Walker and Darrion Dupree will help keep quarterback Braedyn Locke out of third-and-long situations. Perhaps this is a game in which running back Cade Yacamelli, who is averaging a team-best 8.3 yards per carry, could earn touches and provide a spark. Yacamelli hasn’t carried the ball in any of the past three games. Advertisement Locke, meanwhile, simply has to be better. Maybe the answer isn’t having him throw the ball 29 times a game, which has been his average this season. Locke is completing 55.1 percent of his passes and has thrown at least one interception in all seven of his starts. “He’s got to continue to grow and get better, and he knows that,” head coach Luke Fickell said. “We’re going to give him a better opportunity to be able to do that.” Frustration was evident among members of the defense immediately after Wisconsin’s 16-13 loss to No. 1 Oregon last week.The Badgers couldn’t have done much more to put themselves in a position to win against a team that was averaging nearly 36 points per game and had a Heisman Trophy contender at quarterback. Linebacker Jake Chaney and cornerback Nyzier Fourqurean said it was the toughest loss they had felt all season. But Wisconsin, especially with a reeling offense, likely will require another strong defensive performance. Nebraska has a lot more flaws offensively than Wisconsin’s three previous opponents — games that each resulted in losses. For all the excitement surrounding former five-star quarterback Dylan Raiola, the true freshman has been pedestrian of late. After throwing nine touchdowns and two interceptions in his first five games, Raiola has thrown two touchdowns and eight interceptions over his past five games. Nebraska hasn’t scored more than 20 points in the past five contests. The running game hasn’t helped Raiola. During this five-game stretch, the Huskers have averaged 3.1 yards per rushing attempt. No running back has gained more than 61 yards rushing. Nebraska coach Matt Rhule brought in Dana Holgersen last week to serve as offensive coordinator. Wisconsin’s defense played well during a 28-13 loss to No. 3 Penn State four weeks ago and then was thrashed in the next game against Iowa, which ran for 329 yards. Advertisement Wisconsin entered its final two regular-season games last year against Nebraska and Minnesota at 5-5 overall, 3-4 in the Big Ten and on a three-game losing streak. Sound familiar? It felt like that season a year ago was on the verge of disaster, but the Badgers rallied and beat the Huskers and the Gophers. Wisconsin faces the same challenge this time around. The difference is that second year results are no better than Year 1. The same players who preached patience last season have no choice but to utter similar refrains now. But disappointment is mounting, with Longo’s firing serving as the most public admission of failure offensively. The good news from Wisconsin’s perspective is that players generally have maintained a unified front. Receiver CJ Williams said it would be easy for players to start checking out. “But I think our team is so unselfish and mature that we have the opportunity to come together and grow stronger and finish out the season the way we want to and how we should,” he said. Sometimes, an in-season change can temporarily elevate a program by giving players juice. The conundrum for Wisconsin is whether an offense handled so exclusively by the previous play caller can work under someone else in less than a week. It didn’t for Holgersen’s first game at Nebraska in an eight-point loss to USC. The game truly does feel like a toss-up, though Nebraska is a slight betting favorite. Both teams are average. Nebraska is 0-8 under Rhule the past two seasons in games with bowl eligibility on the line. The Huskers also have lost 10 consecutive games to the Badgers. Those streaks won’t last forever, but my inclination is that Wisconsin gets it done Saturday with defense and a better rushing attack to squeak by with a win.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Chiefs defense lacking the same pass-rush production it generated a season ago,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5939069/2024/11/22/chiefs-defense-pass-rush-chris-jones-steve-spagnuolo/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 11:00:59 GMT","The Chiefs were second in the league in sacks last season. Through 10 games this year, Kansas CIty's 19 sacks rank 27th.","NFL KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Twice in Sunday’s loss to the Buffalo Bills, Kansas City Chiefs pass rusher Chris Jones did what he often does in a one-on-one matchup: He quickly defeated an offensive lineman to create immediate pressure on Bills quarterback Josh Allen. The problem for Jones and the Chiefs defense is that Allen finished both plays gaining positive yards instead of falling backward to the turf. Advertisement “We’ve got to get him down,” Jones, the Chiefs’ best defender, said Thursday. “I was there two times and didn’t wrap him up, didn’t get him down. It’s my mistake. (There’s) a lot I can learn from that.” A major reason the Bills scored 30 points in their win over the Chiefs — becoming the first opponent to score at least that many on them since Super Bowl LVII in 2023— is that coordinator Steve Spagnuolo’s unit never sacked Allen. “We’re hoping to crank it up and get the numbers where we want them, the hits, the pressures and getting the quarterback off his spot,” Spagnuolo said. “Those are things we need to get better at.” GO DEEPER How the Chiefs' little mistakes added up to their first loss of the season In fact, one of the biggest differences in Spagnuolo’s unit is that the Chiefs are not sacking quarterbacks as much as they did a year ago. In 2023, the Chiefs were second in the NFL with 57 sacks, sixth in quarterback hits with 63 and 14th in pressures with 172. This season they are 27th (19 sacks), second (45 quarterback hits) and 11th (99 pressures). “I don’t measure everything on sacks,” Spagnuolo said. “That particular quarterback (Allen) and a bunch of these quarterbacks we’ve played (Lamar Jackson, Brock Purdy and Baker Mayfield), we’ve had to play a certain way and sometimes you’re not getting four or five guys turned loose. “It makes it hard and (Allen) makes one guy miss and we’re off point, he can (scramble) like he did on that fourth-down play.” Put the team on his back. @JoshAllenQB 📺: #KCvsBUF on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/8kbW3A8o5y — NFL (@NFL) November 18, 2024  The play Spagnuolo referenced was the most critical late in the fourth quarter, when the Bills had just a 2-point lead and faced fourth-and-2 from the Chiefs 26-yard line. Defensive end George Karlaftis made the first minor mistake. He used a speed rush to gain a step on right tackle Ryan Van Demark but lost his pass-rush lane integrity that was supposed to help contain Allen in the pocket. Once Allen ran forward, he sprinted past defensive tackle Mike Pennel, linebacker Drue Tranquill and cornerback Nazeeh Johnson before reaching the end zone. Advertisement “You have to be critical of your own errors,” Jones said of the Chiefs’ four-man pass rush. “I don’t think we played our best game last (week). A lot of us could’ve played better. We’re going to get better from it. “We’ll get better. It’s something we can do collectively. We have seven more games in the (regular season). (There’s) a lot of football left to be played. We’re not counting numbers right now. We’ll see where we’re at at the end of the year.” Oftentimes against the Bills, and the previous week in a win over the Denver Broncos, Spagnuolo had to unleash a blitz to ensure he generated consistent pressure on the quarterback. The Chiefs’ last two sacks, against Broncos rookie quarterback Bo Nix, were generated in part because Spagnuolo blitzed. BOLTON STRIKES FOR THE 16-YARD SACK ⚡️ pic.twitter.com/aRSmNd4j7N — Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) November 10, 2024  The Chiefs have blitzed at the third-highest rate in the league this season (36.9 percent), according to Next Gen Stats. Spagnuolo’s blitzes have led to the Chiefs’ recording a league-high 39 unblocked pressures, including 33 when sending five or more pass defenders, which also leads in the NFL. One reason Spagnuolo has had to blitz so often is because of the Chiefs’ lack of pressure with just four linemen. Jones once again leads all defensive tackles in the league with a pass-rush win rate — beating a block within 2.5 seconds, according to player tracking data — of 18 percent. The next highest defensive lineman for the Chiefs is Karlaftis, who ranks 19th among edge rushers. Sunday, the Bills anticipated the Chiefs’ blitzes on third down, leading Allen to be successful on pivotal thirds. He finished with eight completions on 16 attempts for 108 yards, a touchdown and an interception when the Chiefs blitz, according to Next Gen Stats. Allen did much better when facing four or fewer pass rushers, completing 19 of his 24 attempts for 154 yards. GO DEEPER NFL MVP odds: Josh Allen takes over lead from Lamar Jackson “The one thing that is concerning to me is that we need to win more third downs,” Spagnuolo said. “I’ve got to look at what I’m calling and we’ve got to look at what we’re doing. Some of those mistakes (from players) were on those particular plays.” Josh Allen to Curtis Samuel extends the Bills' lead! 📺: #KCvsBUF on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/BWGErDx9q3 — NFL (@NFL) November 17, 2024  Spagnuolo has a two-man cavalry approaching to help his four-man pass rush: defensive ends Joshua Uche and Charles Omenihu. Late last month, the Chiefs executed a small trade with the New England Patriots, exchanging a 2026 sixth-round draft pick to acquire Uche, a five-year player. Before he arrived in Kansas City, Uche recorded two sacks, three quarterback hits and 13 tackles in seven games with the Patriots. Advertisement “We were talking about trying to get, because Spags is so creative, a 3-4 linebacker to just give us a speed rusher,” general manager Brett Veach said of Uche last week. “Spags likes to collect power players, guys who are long. Because Steve is so great at what he does, we’ve talked about giving him a different chess piece to work with. “He can serve as the sixth linebacker on special teams, but also provide you a nickel rusher. When Charles comes back, you now have the ability to go with five defensive ends.” Uche played just five snaps against the Bills, but Spagnuolo understands his role — and snap count — should increase after spending close to a month learning the Chiefs’ schemes and pass-rushing techniques. “This is my first time going through something like this, so I’m doing whatever is asked of me,” Uche said of the trade Wednesday. “It’s all about teamwork and coming together as a unit to attack and execute the game plan. I’m doing everything I can to help the team win. All I can do is do my best with the snaps that I’m given.” Meet our defense's newest menace 😤 @_Uche35 pic.twitter.com/mY4Nj1CR4B — Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) October 29, 2024  Last season, Omenihu had seven sacks, 11 quarterback hits and two forced fumbles in 11 games. He created an impressive strip-sack in the victory over the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship Game before suffering a torn ACL in his right knee. The Chiefs opened his 21-day practice window last week and he could return to the field in a limited role as soon as Sunday’s game against the Carolina Panthers. “I give that guy all the credit,” fellow defensive end Mike Danna said. “He’s been working his ass off to get back.” The Chiefs are optimistic that Uche and Omenihu can enhance their pass-rushing production, especially in the postseason. Perhaps the ideal four-man rush for Spagnuolo on third down, if he doesn’t blitz, is a lineup of Jones, Karlaftis, Uche and Omenihu. “When we play our best is when the unit’s chemistry is like that,” Spagnuolo said while interlocking his hands. “If we can get back to that, I think we’ll be OK.” Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"As F1 thrives in Las Vegas, some local businesses still feel the financial strain",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938951/2024/11/22/f1-vegas-local-business-lawsuit-disruption/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 11:00:46 GMT","Race organizers and Clark County have made efforts to lessen the burden on local businesses, but many still resent F1's presence.","Formula 1 LAS VEGAS — Jay’s Market On Flamingo is a corner gas station like so many others in and around Las Vegas, offering a little bit of everything. That it happens to be situated at the intersection of two of Las Vegas’ busiest roads makes it a convenient stop for out-of-towners needing supplies as they head in or out of the city. Advertisement However, in the past two Novembers, that convenience has been interrupted by the construction of the Las Vegas Grand Prix Formula One circuit incorporating 3.8 miles of city streets, necessitating traffic restrictions and outright road closures that create significant gridlock throughout the city. For Wade Bohn, the owner of Jay’s Market, located where Flamingo Road and Koval Lane cross, the congestion isn’t just a traffic nightmare but also a financial nightmare. His store is along the straightaway between Turns 4 and 5. “When I have no control over my business, succeeding or failing, yeah, I’m frustrated,” Bohn said. “I have no control. Literally, no control. For 13 years, I’ve had control of my business, been very profitable, made a great living for me and my employees. F1 comes to town, literally no business. It’s unbelievable and frustrating. “I can’t sleep at night.” As Bohn spoke, his anger was conveyed with his words, a quivering top lip and piercing blue eyes. He explained how the Las Vegas Grand Prix threatens his livelihood. In November 2022, the last time F1 didn’t race here, Jay’s Market had $628,000 in gross sales, Bohn said. The following year, however, sales in November fell considerably. As of this writing, he’s at $144,000 for this month. Overall, taking into account all the construction, road closures, snarled traffic and the closing of a sub shop that rented space inside the store at $4,000 a month, Bohn says he lost $3.4 million year-to-year from 2022 to 2023. And this year will be even worse. The culprit is mostly due to a race that Bohn and many other business owners in the area do not want to continue beyond this year, arguing that doing so will likely push them beyond their economic means. Already, Bohn has had to reduce his workforce by half and has started looking for a second job to help supplement his income. Advertisement “If there’s a fourth year (of the Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2026) I will bank on it that I will go into bankruptcy and lose my business,” Bohn said. “I am currently looking for work right now. Me, the owner, I need a job. I need to make money. I’m not making any money. It’s terrible.” Four lawsuits have been filed against Clark County by local business owners, including Bohn, seeking financial damages for negatively impacting their businesses. The Las Vegas Grand Prix declined comment related to any ongoing litigation. “We’re not like New York City where most everybody kind of lives in New York and where you can walk to work,” Lisa Mayo-DeRiso, a spokesperson for one group of business owners suing the county, told The Athletic. “Here, we have to drive to work or take the bus to work. People are having an hour to two hours to three hours a day extra to get to work and to get home. And F1 is not compensating anybody for those extra hours, babysitting time, time in your car, lost hours, lost time. They’re not compensating anybody for anything. They don’t believe that they should have to. “Our businesses have lost money.” Race organizers and Clark County have made considerable efforts to lessen the burden on local businesses, Lori Nelson-Kraft, senior vice president of corporate affairs for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, told The Athletic. Construction of the circuit for this year’s race was shorter than a year ago by 65 percent. And as much as possible, construction was done overnight to minimize disruption during busier hours. Representatives for the race have also met with local business owners, including Bohn, and they say they’re receptive to ideas that would further help the community. “We have adjusted plans based on that feedback,” Nelson-Kraft said. “So any of those businesses that participate have been able to have those forums to share that information and they are always included.” Advertisement One idea conceived to help ease traffic congestion was reducing the temporary bridge on Flamingo Road over Koval Lane from the four lanes it was last year to two. That bridge went up in October. “A lot of improvements have been made, and I will say that the restaurants that are in and around the circuit, specifically in that corridor, I have personally eaten at since the vehicular bridge has gone in,” Nelson-Kraft said. “And, anecdotally, while eating in that area there with my husband, I had conversations with their staff where they have shared with me, just as a guest of their venues, that they have seen remarkable improvements over last year.” According to Bohn, though, the bridge has yet to help. Instead, it effectively placed a wall around his store. Traffic flow is further backed to where even regular customers are deterred from stopping. At another small business in the area, a clerk (who asked not to be identified) took off his glasses and rubbed his temple when asked about the bridge. He followed by letting out an exasperated sigh, dropping an f-bomb and saying he didn’t have a comment other than to refer to the bridge by the derisive nickname used by some locals: “The Bridge to Bankruptcy.” “F1 tells me this is going to help me, but it looks like a three-story prison that’s covered in black tarp,” Bohn said. “There’s no access to my property from Koval, it’s completely shut off. I sit on a corner that has two access points when F1 is not here. I only have one when they’re here. When they’re here, it’s bad.” Said Mayo-DeRiso: “They put up that stupid bridge that cuts traffic. It absolutely impedes the flow of traffic.” Ideally, critics of the race would prefer the Las Vegas Grand Prix shift outside the city so that throughways no longer require being shut down. But the likelihood that Formula One would be willing to run on a circuit other than one that sees drivers speed down the Strip is a longshot, at best. The city and F1 have a 10-year contract. Advertisement According to Nelson-Kraft, last year’s inaugural grand prix had a $1.5 billion economic impact on the city. That figure outperformed expectations and the Super Bowl Las Vegas hosted in February, which generated $1 billion. Tax revenue from the race brought in $77 million, the most in Las Vegas history. Revenue projections for this year’s grand prix are lower than the 2023 edition, though they’re expected to remain robust. What that exact figure is won’t be known until weeks and months after Saturday night’s race. Three hundred thousand attendees are expected to turn through the gates across the three-day race weekend. “We are a tourism-driven economy, we are dependent on 150,000 plus hotel rooms filling up,” Nelson-Kraft said. “Special events are one of the big ways that we do it. And nobody hosts big events better than Las Vegas.” Standing in front of a drink cooler inside his store, Bohn wonders where all that money is going. None of it is being directed towards him, he said, while his bills continue to pile up due to an event he views as an unnecessary burden. “The s— pile keeps building up,” Bohn said. “I need this to go away. This nightmare goes away, I will sleep better.” (Top photo of Jay’s Market owner Wade Bohn: K.M.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,What we've learned about the Maple Leafs at the quarter mark of the season,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938576/2024/11/22/maple-leafs-season-quarter-mark-analysis/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 11:00:38 GMT","It's a good time to take stock of where the Maple Leafs are at, through the highs and lows of their season so far.","NHL I don’t think many of us had “Auston Matthews goes out of the lineup and the Maple Leafs go on a 6-1-0 run” on our bingo card for how the first month and a half of the season would go. But it’s been that kind of an unpredictable year so far in Toronto. We’re now at the 20-game mark, a quarter of the way through the season, so it’s a good time to take stock of where the Leafs are at through the highs (their current hot streak) and lows (a 3-4-2 stretch prior to that) of their season. Advertisement Let’s dig into some of the numbers and trends. After Joseph Woll shut out the Vegas Golden Knights on Wednesday, the Leafs now have the fifth-best save percentage (.914) and second-best five-on-five save percentage (.938) in the NHL. Few would have predicted that coming into the season given they had one of the least experienced tandems in the league. And especially considering Woll missed the start of the campaign due to injury. Not only have Anthony Stolarz and Woll been excellent overall, they’ve led the Leafs to the third-biggest save percentage improvement in the NHL this season. It remains a little understated how much goaltending hurt this team last season. Jumping from 25th up to fifth is absolutely massive, as they would have allowed another 12 goals at this point with last year’s save percentage. That would drop them to a negative goal differential and a much poorer record. Better defensive play is part of the story, as they’ve risen from 17th to 10th in quality of scoring chances allowed. But the Leafs’ goals saved above expected, which measures goaltending independent of defensive play, is sky-high — largely thanks to Stolarz, who sits fourth overall in that stat so far this season. There very well could be some regression in net the rest of the way, as only one team (Winnipeg) managed a team save percentage last season as high as where Toronto is now. But the bulk of this improvement is real. Take a bow, Lane Lambert. I didn’t think anyone predicted the Leafs would suddenly become an elite squad while shorthanded this offseason under the new associate coach, but they’re currently seventh in the NHL with a kill rate of nearly 85 percent. A Leafs team has finished that high or better just once since 2002-03, way back in the dead puck era, when Robert Svehla and Alyn McCauley were getting it done on a ridiculous 87 percent PK. Advertisement The interesting thing is the shorthanded improvement this season is being driven much more by the system and defensive play than the goalies. The Leafs’ team save percentage down a man is actually fairly similar to last season, but their expected goals against has been cut by more than 20 percent. Again, as with overall team save percentage, that’s one of the biggest improvements across the league. When it comes to the systemic part of it, regular Leaf Report analyst Frankie Corrado offered up this great video that explains the shift Lambert has Toronto’s PKers making. How different is the Leafs PK from last year to this year? @TSNHockey pic.twitter.com/cDbI2aKTK2 — Frank Corrado (@frankcorrado22) October 18, 2024  Which players have been driving the improvement within that new system? Steven Lorentz stands out the most, as the Leafs are allowing just 4.99 expected goals against per 60 minutes shorthanded with him on the ice. That sits fourth best leaguewide among all forwards who have killed at least 30 minutes so far this season. Last season the Leafs only had one player under 7.50 in that category, and some of their most used players — like TJ Brodie (9.17), David Kämpf (8.62) and Mark Giordano (8.46) — were getting crushed on the PK. Having the Chris Tanev and Jake McCabe pair take on the bulk of the minutes instead of the mediocre D group they used last year has also been huge. And, when healthy, Matthews was performing very well down a man, too. Steven Lorentz on blocking three shots in the same spot last night, including two on the same shift ""I was channelling my inner Timmy Brent there 🙂 … It definitely didn’t feel too good, but it’s always worth it when the guys come through."" Foot a little swollen today https://t.co/MD4OG9w8jk — Mark Masters (@markhmasters) November 21, 2024  The Leafs currently have the eighth-best record in the NHL and are on pace to finish with 4.6 more points than last season, a decent bump given the injuries they’ve dealt with. I doubt that’ll be enough to win the Atlantic Division, but it should be good for home ice in the first round. And at least keep them close to the defending champion Florida Panthers, who are the team to beat. Advertisement The fact the Leafs have done that while producing only the 16th most goals in the league is pretty hard to believe. The combination of the two sections above — great goaltending and great penalty killing — plus the Tanev factor have meant the Leafs’ defensive gains have overcome their offensive shortcomings so far. There’s certainly room for improvement in a lot of offensive categories, however, especially if you look at some of the underlying numbers. The Leafs are 23rd in shot attempts at even strength, for example, and 17th in shots for. In both areas, they’re giving up more than they’re generating, an indication that their ability to maintain zone time has been meh at best. They fare slightly better on expected goals and scoring chances, so the quality of what they’re producing is better than the quantity, which is great. But there’s not really any offensive metric where they are well above average right now. Like the PK, some of this is systems (as Justin Bourne laid out nicely recently) and some of this is personnel. But you can particularly see it if you look at the chance generation for the bottom-six forwards, many of whom aren’t producing anything under new coach Craig Berube’s north-south, dump-and-chase approach. For context: The average NHL team generates roughly 2.55 expected goals per 60 minutes at even strength. But when the Leafs have someone like Kämpf on the ice, they’re generating just 1.47, the fourth-worst mark of any forward in the league (minimum 100 minutes played). That’s old-school enforcer territory. Other players well below the average include Pontus Holmberg (seventh worst in the league), Lorentz (25th worst), Ryan Reaves (29th), Nick Robertson (35th), Bobby McMann and Max Domi. That’s a ton of passengers, players who in some cases are on the ice for 40 percent fewer chances than a break-even comparable would be. It’s hard to believe it’s even possible for one team to have five of the NHL’s 35 most impotent forwards, but that’s where Toronto is at with its bottom six. Advertisement It’s hard to win if half your forward group can’t produce more than an expected goal every four games. The Leafs have already been missing Matthews (obviously) and Max Pacioretty in this department, and any games Matthew Knies misses will hurt deeply, too, given he’s been one of their most dangerous players (3.15 expected goals per 60). But they do have other options, and the Vegas game showed why they need to try and use them and sit some of the underperformers. Speaking of which … We don’t want to go too wacky over small sample sizes and, to use Ron Wilson’s famous phrasing, build statues for young players before they’re ready for such accolades. But Wednesday’s win was certainly fun to watch thanks to the presence of Fraser Minten and Nikita Grebenkin. Both of them have been excellent with the Marlies so far in their first season as North American pros, and both showed enough against one of the best teams in the Western Conference that they deserve more time with the big club. Not that the Leafs have a ton of choice, what with as many as seven forwards out if Knies can’t play on Sunday against the Utah Hockey Club. But both Minten and Grebenkin (and to a lesser extent Alex Steeves) all looked far more dangerous than half of Toronto’s regular forwards have all season. You don’t want to rush anyone, but the good news is both players are on entry-level deals and can go up and down to the AHL as needed. Minten and Grebenkin are young, yes, but they have good heads on their shoulders; if they continue to play well, and end up getting into 15 or 20 games the rest of the way, that’s nothing but a big positive for the organization heading into another pivotal postseason. It may also give the front office and coaching staff more confidence when it comes time to start moving out some of the underperformers. Advertisement At the very least, the competition should be wide open for forward spots down the lineup. Regardless of contractual status, age or experience, they need to give everyone a chance to show if they can produce or not. And let the best players win the jobs. (Photo of Joseph Woll: John E.

Alisson is slowly stepping up his training load at Kirkby having been sidelined since early October with a hamstring injury. Advertisement Caoimhin Kelleher will continue to deputise away to Southampton in the Premier League on Sunday and the Republic of Ireland goalkeeper is also set to face the European champions in midweek. “We are careful with everyone, especially when it comes to muscle injuries,” Slot said. “Ali is back in training with the goalkeeper coach, but he is not training with the team yet. That is expected soon and then let’s wait and see where he is in terms of match fitness. He’s getting better and better. “Trent isn’t training with us yet but he is getting there. Jota is still apart from the group, the same as Federico (Chiesa), who is maybe coming back in the session with one exercise today.” Alexander-Arnold did not go away on England duty due to a minor hamstring injury he suffered against Aston Villa before the international break, while Jota has missed the past six matches with a chest problem. Asked whether Alisson, Alexander-Arnold or Jota had any chance of featuring either against Real Madrid next Wednesday or against Manchester City the following Sunday, Slot added: “That is something we have to wait and see. “The last few days of recovery is always the most tricky as they have to go from isolated training sessions to the group training sessions. “It’s difficult for me to judge now whether it will be one, two, three days or a bit longer. “With Alisson and Jota, I don’t expect them to be available for that game (against Madrid).

Last week in a social-media post, the 28-year-old said that his house had been targeted once more and pleaded that it be “respected as a safe place” for his family. The initial incident took place in January during Newcastle United’s 3-2 defeat to Manchester City. Advertisement In April, Joelinton signed a long-term contract extension to remain at St James’ Park. However, in his Instagram post, Joelinton said: “What we care about most is our family’s safety and our kids growing up without fear. We simply want to live in peace.” Newcastle spent part of the two-week international break in Saudi Arabia at a warm-weather training camp and Howe and the club have sought to reassure Joelinton. “Joe is fine, obviously shaken up initially,” Howe said at his press conference ahead of Newcastle’s Premier League matches with Eddie Howe on Monday night. “I’ve had several conversations with him about his situation and his family and his family’s well-being, which is of course the priority. “Very sad really to see that happen to him again. Once is bad enough to see him in that situation, again, the same property, same outcome. I felt really sorry for him and we’re obviously, as a football club, helping him through this process and doing everything we can to ensure the safety of himself and his family and his possessions.” What’s more, Howe admitted that Newcastle are conscious of what appears to be a growing trend of break-ins at the houses of sports people and celebrities. “It is. It’s something we’ve been aware of for a long time and we’ve been trying to give support to the players in terms of trying to make sure that we’re as strong and resilient as we can, in terms of safety and procedures that the players need to put in place to protect themselves and their properties,” Howe said. “It is a growing concern. I think there’s been a lot of work done to provide that support and make sure that we are looking at prevention and ways to make sure that this doesn’t happen again. Certainly, we’ll try to do everything we can to improve that side of things for the players.” Callum Wilson may make his first appearance of the season against West Ham on Monday night, although Howe insists Newcastle will be cautious with the striker, given his string of injury problems, the latest of which have affected his back and his hamstring. “He’s doing well,” Howe said of Wilson. “We anticipate he’s going to train with the group today. Whether he’s quite there for West Ham, let’s see. There’s a chance he’ll be involved but we have to get through the next few days of training first. Advertisement “The most important thing is that Callum does come back and when he does he’s in a good place to contribute given his importance. We’re at a delicate stage of his return. We have to manage the last parts carefully. Such a valuable player but we have to learn from previous spells.” Kieran Trippier, meanwhile, is in line to return to the Newcastle squad for the first time since October 5 following his hamstring injury. “Slightly closer I’d say,” Howe said. “He trained yesterday, trained well, felt good, no ill-effects, and looked sharp. We’re in the same situation in terms of managing the last few days of rehab carefully.” Dan Burn will serve a one-match suspension for picking up five yellow cards, while Emil Krafth is set to miss six to eight weeks after breaking his collarbone. “Just Emil Krafth had an operation,” Howe said. “We anticipate he’s going to be out for around six to eight weeks. That’s a big blow for us to lose him as such a consistent performer.

Here’s what it means The Premier League, due to being unable to process APT deals and potentially open to damages from other clubs trying to secure associated party deals in the interim period, were keen to table their list of amendments as quickly as possible. They have been consulting with clubs for more than a month regarding changing the APT rules, with Manchester City’s view being that no vote should take place until the tribunal has provided its full guidance on the APT rules. The Premier League have spent the last few weeks addressing the points that were found to be unlawful in the tribunal, leaving the other regulations in place. The new rules, the Premier League say, will ensure there is parity between the treatment of shareholder loans and other APTs going forward. Transitional rules will be in place to clarify how existing shareholder loans will be treated within that framework. Going forward, shareholder loans will need to be submitted as an APT and subjected to a fair market value assessment. Advertisement If it is determined that the loan is not fair market value, then the club will have to terminate or vary the loan to reflect what the Premier League deems to be fair market value and also pay any shortfall in interest. Another change to the rules is that any shareholder loan which is replaced with other forms of payer — such as being converted into equity or repayment — within 50 days will not be required to be submitted as an APT or assessed for fair market value. If a shareholder loan was entered into the accounts after December 14, 2021 and remains in effect on January 11, 2025, then it must be submitted as an APT. Should the Premier League then determine it is not at fair market value, then the club is allowed to retain the loan on its existing terms, although adjustments will need to be made to its accounts for 2024-25 as if it was at fair market value. Aston Villa’s co-owner, Nassef Sawiris, had called for the vote to be delayed, telling the Daily Telegraph on Wednesday that they would be “voting against the proposed APT rules”, lobbying instead for a three-month delay. But 16 top-flight clubs voted in favour of amending the rules now, meaning the Premier League has scored a victory. The Premier League also announced that clubs have unanimously agreed to establish a new in-house media operations business after 20 years in partnership with IMG. The plan is for all international media content production and distribution to be brought in-house for the start of the 2026-27 season. The meeting also saw the dates for the 2025-26 campaign confirmed with the opening round of fixtures set to begin on Saturday, August 16 with the closing weekend coming  on Sunday, May 24.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,General Motors nearing approval for F1 grid spot in 2026,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940015/2024/11/22/f1-general-motors-entry-approval-2026/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 09:38:16 GMT",General Motors is edging toward securing a place on the Formula One grid as early as 2026 when the field could expand to 11 teams.,"Formula 1 LAS VEGAS — General Motors is edging toward securing a place on the Formula One grid with its own team as early as 2026, when the field could expand to 11 teams. First reported by the Associated Press on Thursday, multiple sources have confirmed to The Athletic that the bid initially put forward by Andretti Global, which F1 rejected at the end of January, has gained fresh momentum in recent weeks thanks to General Motors’ involvement. Advertisement It comes following a restructuring of the senior management at Andretti, which included the exit of Michael Andretti, the chairman and CEO, from an operational role, handing the reins over to Dan Towriss, who took an ownership stake in Andretti Global in 2022. Towriss has been on site ahead of this weekend’s Las Vegas Grand Prix, which staged its opening practice sessions on Thursday evening. Andretti’s proposal always heavily leaned on involvement from General Motors, which planned to build its own F1 power unit in 2028 and enter the sport through its Cadillac brand. The Athletic revealed in the days prior to the F1 rejection announcement that the prototype Andretti F1 car, a version of which was already in the wind tunnel, was in development with significant input from General Motors’ engineers. However, concerns over the quality of the entry, which F1 referred to as “a novice constructor” when detailing its decision, and the gap until General Motors would build its own engine in 2028 prompted it to reject the bid in January. It sparked an outcry from the Andretti family and also led the Department of Justice’s antitrust division to launch an investigation into F1’s owner, Liberty Media, over the decision. Liberty maintained that it would fully cooperate with the DOJ’s investigation. F1 said when rejecting Andretti that it “would look differently on an application for the entry of a team into the 2028 championship with a GM power unit, either as a GM works team or as a GM customer team designing all allowable components in-house.” The possibility of having another sizable automaker, particularly in the United States at a time when the sport has enjoyed rapid American growth, has always appealed to F1. It is understood there could be an announcement soon from F1 providing an update on the process regarding General Motors’ bid as it takes over the Andretti project. Advertisement F1’s current 10 teams have always been lukewarm about expanding the grid. Under the existing commercial terms, General Motors would be required to pay an anti-dilution fee that would be split between the existing 10 teams due to the change in the prize money revenue. But a sign of a softening in the stance toward General Motors joining the grid as an 11th team came in Thursday’s FIA press conference ahead of the Las Vegas GP, featuring Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff and Ferrari F1 chief Fred Vasseur, both of whom seemed receptive to the possibility. “I think if a team can add to the championship, particularly if GM decides to come in as a team owner, that is a different story,” Wolff said. “As long as it is accretive, that means we’re growing the popularity of the sport, we’re growing the revenue of the sport, then no team will be ever against it. So I’m putting my hope in there.” Vasseur noted that the teams did not have a say in the matter, with the decision lying solely with F1. “For sure, as Toto said, that if it’s good for the sport, good for the show, good for the business, and add value on the sporting side, that we are all OK,” Vasseur said. “But again, the decision is with FOM.” F1 declined to comment on the topic when contacted by The Athletic.  A spokesperson from Cadillac told The Athletic, “We continue to work with the FIA and FOM regarding our expression of interest and are excited about our progress.  In parallel, development of our team, car and power unit continue.  We have no additional news to announce at this time.”  GO DEEPER How F1 turns America's most famous road into a racetrack  (Photo: General Motors) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The teenage pair also have manager Regis Le Bris saying they are best staying on Wearside for their development. Advertisement Rigg, who made his Sunderland debut at 15, signed a three-year deal in July and Bellingham extended his contract in August until June 2028. Yet the impressive progress of both players has seen them tracked by clubs in the Premier League and Europe. The length of the contracts give Sunderland negotiating strength, as does the form of the team under Le Bris and the fact both teenagers are playing regularly. The Sunderland manager, speaking at the club’s training ground on Thursday, was keen to emphasise the players should understand the nature of “the project” they are involved in and the benefits of staying where they are. “I think with these players,” Le Bris said of Rigg and Bellingham, “they are involved in the project, and they know that they can improve in this team. “So from a personal perspective, it is good for them, and also to be part of this journey as well. It is rare to have this. Sometimes you can go a whole career without having these elements — where you are in a club, you like that club, you are improving and you believe in a very interesting journey. I am confident for the future. “I think it is important for them to be here until the challenge is not high enough for them. Probably, when they feel that they need something more to develop, that should be the right moment to leave. “But at the minute, for both players, I think they are still in the right zone for their career development. They need to play, and they need to learn. They need to learn about playing in a collective style, so for them, I think the culture we have here is still working for them. I think the graph of their learning is still going up at a good level.” Le Bris said the topic is not discussed every day but the club are aware of increasing interest and, while it is not anticipated either will move in January, he acknowledged: “I know the journey the players are on, but the environment is still complex. “From a rational perspective, it is very clear, but sometimes you do not know what else in going on in the environment that a player is in. Sometimes that can make them make another decision.” Advertisement Bellingham is one of three significant Sunderland suspensions at Millwall, along with Trai Hume and Patrick Roberts. The manager also had bad news on two more injured players, Romaine Mundle (hamstring) and Alan Browne (leg fracture), who will be both be out of “six to eight weeks”. The better news is that Aji Alese is fit again and available. Millwall have won four of their last five matches to jump to eighth in the Championship, including 1-0 victories over promotion favourites Leeds United and Burnley. This is the first of three big games for Sunderland in seven days — West Bromwich Albion at home on Tuesday and a trip to Sheffield United next Friday follow. “A massive week,” smiled Le Bris, using his fingers as quotation marks.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Browns stun Steelers in snowy Cleveland as Nick Chubb scores late go-ahead TD: Key takeaways,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5939592/2024/11/22/steelers-browns-score-result-takeaways/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 05:20:41 GMT",Chubb's first two-touchdown game since 2022 helped fuel Cleveland to its third win of the season.,"NFL By Zac Jackson, Mike DeFabo and Amos Morale III As rapidly falling snow piled up on Huntington Bank Field, the Cleveland Browns turned to Nick Chubb to carry them home against the Pittsburgh Steelers in a 24-19 win Thursday night. After trailing by 12 in the fourth quarter, the Steelers (8-3) stormed back to take a 19-18 lead late in the fourth quarter by scoring back-to-back touchdowns within a two-minute span. Advertisement But then Browns QB Jameis Winston settled into a groove. After the blinding snow wreaked havoc on the passing game previously, he overcame the wintry conditions to orchestrate a nine-play, 45-yard drive, punctuated in the game’s final minute by Chubb plowing ahead for a 2-yard touchdown. Chubb’s two-touchdown game was his first since 2022, and Winston added another rushing score early in the fourth to fuel Cleveland to its third win of the season (3-8). After the game, Steelers WR George Pickens, who got in a scuffle with Browns CB Greg Newsome II after the final play, told a group of reporters the weather played the largest factor in the game, not the Browns’ success. “The conditions played a huge, huge part in today’s game. I don’t really think the Cleveland Browns are a good team at all,” he said. “I think the conditions kind of saved them.”  Jerry Jeudy has been a new player since Winston took over, and Jeudy delivered again here. The Browns appeared to have had this game won multiple times, but they didn’t set themselves up to really win it until Winston hit Jeudy on third down with a little over a minute left. It was the Browns’ first third-down conversion of the night in 10 tries, and it set up a situation where the Steelers basically had to let Chubb score his second touchdown of the night to preserve time. A strange, snowy game went to the home team thanks to multiple heroics, but the Browns would not have won it without Winston and Jeudy, who had six catches for 85 yards and has topped 70 receiving yards in each of Winston’s four starts. — Zac Jackson, Browns beat writer The Browns won in wild fashion. They wouldn’t have won without going 4-for-4 in converting fourth downs. There was a lot of sloppiness from both sides as part of a 27-point fourth quarter, but the Steelers failing to convert three fourth downs ended up coming back to sting them. Advertisement The Steelers tried a 58-yard field goal instead of punting on the game’s first drive, and later in the first quarter they inserted Justin Fields for a predictable fourth down run that the Browns blew up. Later, Jaylen Warren ran right into the teeth of the Browns defense on a fourth down run. The Steelers made a bunch of questionable decisions in this game, and it’s not a stretch to say they mismanaged those fourth downs and a late third down on which they had Fields throw a deep pass instead of running in snowy conditions. It was not Mike Tomlin’s finest moment. — Jackson The Browns defense has not played to its pay grade or its 2023 standard. And though it faltered in the fourth quarter, the Browns finished more plays than the Steelers defense did and ultimately finished the game. Myles Garrett had 3 1/2 sacks, and the Browns came up big on multiple fourth downs and on the Steelers final two possessions. —Jackson The Steelers’ boom-or-bust offense showed its explosive side and its warts. For most of the game, Pittsburgh’s most-consistent offense came from Russell Wilson deep shots. However, the Steelers struggled to run the ball consistently, couldn’t keep Wilson upright and repeatedly failed on short-yardage situations. By the time the Browns took a 18-6, fourth-quarter lead, the Steelers had gone seven quarters without a touchdown. Needing a spark, the Steelers leaned on both of their quarterbacks. First, Fields provided a chunk play on a designed quarterback run, racing 30 yards down the right sideline. He later helped cap the drive with a touchdown when he came into the game and handed the ball to Warren on a read-option. Then, after Nick Herbig strip-sacked Winston, Wilson connected with Calvin Austin III for a 23-yard touchdown to put the Steelers ahead, 19-18. Advertisement The Steelers have been a difficult team to figure out this season. Erasing a 12-point lead in six minutes — after failing to score for seven quarters — continues to make this a hard team to understand. Blowing that lead makes the conversation even messier. But one thing is becoming clear: Playing both quarterbacks may be necessary for the Steelers get out of ruts and rectify their red zone woes. — Mike DeFabo, Steelers beat writer The Steelers’ defense was nearly perfect on third down, as the Browns went 1-for-10 on the evening. However, fourth down was a completely different story. The Browns went 4-for-4. That included a Winston rushing touchdown that put the Browns ahead 18-6. Later, with Pittsburgh leading 19-18, the Steelers had a chance to end the game when the Browns faced a fourth-and-3 from Pittsburgh’s 38. However, Winston hit Jeudy for five yards and a first down. Later in that same series, the one third down the Browns did complete was a back-breaker that set them up for the go-ahead touchdown. — DeFabo (Photo: Nick Cammett / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Caitlin Clark joins ownership group looking to bring NWSL team to Cincinnati,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5939553/2024/11/21/caitlin-clark-nwsl-cincinnati-team-ownership/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 03:23:36 GMT",Cincinnati is considered a finalist in the race to land the NWSL’s 16th franchise.,"NWSL Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark has joined an ownership group looking to bring an NWSL expansion team to Cincinnati, a representative for the NWSL Cincinnati bid confirmed to The Athletic. On Friday, NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman confirmed Cincinnati, Cleveland and Denver as the three finalists in the bidding process for the league’s 16th team. Advertisement “The process is ongoing, and we’re really enthusiastic about the final three prospects that we have in the process,” she said in her league address ahead of the NWSL Championship in Kansas City. “Those three markets are Cincinnati, Cleveland and Denver, and we’ll have news to share in the coming weeks as we move to close with one of those three markets.” The league is expected to award the bid before the end of the year, with that team beginning play in 2026 alongside another expansion team in Boston. ESPN was the first to break the news of Clark’s involvement. “The NWSL Cincinnati bid team is thrilled that Caitlin Clark has joined our ownership group in pursuit of bringing a women’s professional soccer team to our city,” the ownership group said. “Her passion for the sport, commitment to elevating women’s sports in and around the Greater Cincinnati region, and influence as an athlete and role model for women and girls around the world, make her a vital part of our compelling bid to become the 16th team in the NWSL.” The 22-year-old Clark was selected first in the WNBA Draft by the Indiana Fever in 2024 after a prolific college career at the University of Iowa. Her rookie season for the Fever brought with it unprecedented attention, or what many called the “Caitlin Clark effect.” While Clark’s involvement in an NWSL may come as a surprise to some, her interest in soccer was well-documented. She grew up as a two-sport athlete in Iowa, playing soccer in high school before committing to basketball full-time. “Her accomplishments and contributions to women’s sports is incredible, historic. It’s changed the game for everyone, and she’s amazing. Having her interest in the NWSL is an honor,” Berman said. “We couldn’t be more excited about her having shared her own personal story about having been a young soccer player and loving the game, and her messaging around being a multi-sport athlete is so important for young kids who aspire to be just like her, and the future is bright for how we could potentially work with her or others who are influencers and interested in engaging and growing our league.” Advertisement The Cincinnati group has strong ties to Major League Soccer’s FC Cincinnati. The group, led by Jeff Berding, FC Cincinnati’s president and co-CEO, the team’s controlling ownership group and management team, with support from “a cohort of women executives,” first confirmed its interest in June. While the NWSL has been tightlipped about the race for NWSL’s next expansion team, a name like Clark’s certainly raises the profile for Cincinnati to bid. It helps that the team has the backing of FC Cincinnati’s ownership, meaning that an NWSL team in the city could potentially share resources and facilities with the MLS club. The ownership group in nearby Cleveland recently announced an ambitious proposal to build a new stadium to support a future NWSL team as well as an MLS Next team in the city’s downtown. It secured the land through a public-private partnership with the city. That proposal, though, hinges on the NWSL bid being awarded to them.

The committee overseeing the Hall’s contributor category bypassed the New England Patriots owner in favor of Ralph Hay, who helped set up the original meetings for the league that became the NFL, according to a league source. Hay was also owner of the Canton Bulldogs from 1918 to 1922, winning an NFL title with them. Advertisement Kraft, 83, has hoped to join the game’s greats in the Hall of Fame for multiple years now but was again passed over by the committee. Kraft’s supporters would note that since Jerry Jones, who has overseen three Super Bowl teams, is in the Hall of Fame, Kraft certainly should be considering he’s won twice as many Super Bowls, while, like Jones, serving as one of the game’s most influential figures. Kraft chairs the league’s core media committee, which was responsible for securing a new media rights deal in 2021 reportedly worth more than $100 billion and helped broker a deal in 2011 that ended a lockout. Kraft also built Gillette Stadium and oversaw the creation of Patriot Place, a multi-use commercial complex that became the envy of other owners. While it’s unclear the exact reasons the committee hasn’t yet chosen Kraft to enter the Hall of Fame, it’s possible that the Patriots’ scandals (Spygate and Deflategate top among them) and Kraft’s 2019 misdemeanor solicitation of prostitution charges in Florida, which were dropped, played a role. Kraft has been a finalist for consideration from the committee for 13 straight years. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Plenty of players mentioned finding the balance between riding their respective semifinal successes into the final while also trying to get the timing and intensity right so that their emotions would help instead of hinder. Advertisement Both teams had interesting roads to the final, with the Spirit going all the way to penalties and getting three saves out of Aubrey Kingsbury, and the Pride eventually opening up to take the lead on the Current but having to endure 18 minutes of stoppage before they could seal the victory. For the Pride, there was a lot of reflection on the unprecedented season they’d had and just how much work has gone into this moment, including their league-leading defense, featuring Defender of the Year Emily Sams. “I don’t know what it is,” Sams said when asked what about the Pride’s defensive unit had them clicking all season long. “I think for me, I love playing with Kylie (Strom). We’ve had conversations about that, and I think that makes like this – and with Anna (Moorhouse) the center of our defense — so solid, just because we both enjoy playing with each other so much, and we’ve gotten to know each other’s tendencies. And I think we see the game very similarly. So I think that contributes a lot to it, but I think it’s just the chemistry.” “There’s a reason why what we did this year has never been done before and may never be done again,” said Strom. “I think we fully understand what we did is incredible. And next year, I don’t think we’re gonna go into preseason being like, ‘Hey, we’re gonna go 24 games unbeaten.’ Our goal setting is not going to be these crazy things. I think for us, why we’ve broken all of these records and had an incredible season is we’ve just been worried about the process and not the result.” Part of that process is obviously the defensive work that former defender and head coach Seb Hines has put into the team. But Orlando is also a team that can hit you through build up, through transition, through direct balls or wide play, and that makes it hard to predict how this No. 1 versus No. 2 clash will play out. Advertisement “I think we have good variety to our attack, and so that’s our biggest strength,” said Kerry Abello. “If we’re being shut down out wide, we’ll go right up the middle. I think (Washington’s) biggest thing is their attacking threats with (Trinity) Rodman, (Rosemond) Kouassi, that we know that we’re gonna be under it a little bit.” GO DEEPER NWSL Championship: How Orlando Pride and Washington Spirit match up For the Spirit, the clear highlight of their afternoon was Rookie of the Year Croix Bethune also picking up the Midfielder of the Year award. The entire team had come prepared with t-shirts, which they all donned before posing for a group photo on stage (owner Michele Kang played along, though opted to hold up her shirt rather than layer it over her far more fashionable ensemble than the Nike tracksuit sported by the players). Many of the Spirit players have spoken about the changes across the season, but one of the other main storylines heading into this championship is the stellar play of their rookies — including Bethune, but certainly not limited to her. Midfielder Hal Hershfelt said Thursday that the rest of the team had the expectation from day one that while it was understood the rookie class was young, that didn’t change anything. “We’re not going to treat you like rookies,” was the message, according to Hershfelt. “They expect you to make an impact, like any other player of any other age would,” she said. “That set our confidence up. They believe in us.” The team’s grit was another constant theme, no matter what player was speaking — but the team has also felt prepared all season long for whatever challenge laid ahead of them, even as change was a constant. The semifinal win over Gotham was the first example Andi Sullivan brought up. “We felt prepared. We felt like we had momentum in the game, although sometimes the other team, especially if they’re down a player, would want to just make it to penalties,” she said. Advertisement But they were prepared for those too. “We approached it in the way that we wanted to, and I felt really confident.” “I didn’t realize how many changes and battles we’ve had to overcome until being asked these questions,” said Casey Krueger, referencing the team’s midseason coaching change and its multiple injured players. “I’m like, ‘wow, we have actually had to go through a whole lot.’ And I think that just illustrates how well leaders have stepped up within the team, how well the club has done to make it such a seamless transition, to make it seem like — you know, I didn’t even think about all these things that we’ve gone through.” The Pride and the Spirit will face each other for the final trophy of the year on Saturday night in Kansas City at CPKC Stadium, at 8 p.m. ET. The game will air on CBS. (Photo: Stephen M. Dowell / Orlando Sentinel / Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Alyssa Nakken, who was promoted to a full-time coaching role with the San Francisco Giants in 2020, has accepted a player development position with the Cleveland Guardians, a league source confirmed to The Athletic. Nakken’s departure from San Francisco was first reported by Steven Rissotto and confirmed by the Giants on Friday. Advertisement “We thank Alyssa Nakken for her incredible contributions to the San Francisco Giants and for trailblazing a path for women in sports,” the Giants said in a statement. “Her leadership, dedication, and passion for the game have inspired countless individuals, and her impact has been truly transformative for the Giants organization and the baseball community. As she embarks on this exciting new chapter in her career, we have no doubt that she’ll continue to inspire and achieve great things. We wish her and her family nothing but the best.” Nakken, 34, became the first woman to coach on the field in a regular-season MLB game when she filled in for first base coach Antoan Richardson after he was ejected in the third inning of a game against the San Diego Padres on April 12, 2022. She made history again in 2023 when she interviewed for the Giants’ vacant managerial position. “Manager and/or bench coach positions are two that my interests gravitate towards at this point in time,” Nakken said after coaching her first full season in 2020. After starring as a first baseman for Sacramento State’s softball team from 2009-12, Nakken joined the Giants as an intern in their baseball operations department in 2014. Nakken joined the Giants’ coaching staff full-time when Gabe Kapler was the team’s manager and also spent one season as part of Bob Melvin’s 11-person coaching staff. Other coaches who’ve left the Giants this offseason include hitting coaches Justin Viele and Pedro Guerrero (who went to the Texas Rangers and Miami Marlins, respectively) and pitching coach Bryan Price.

Now, federal authorities are investigating whether former Temple guard Hysier Miller bet on his games and purposely altered the outcome, ESPN reported Thursday, citing sources with direct knowledge. Advertisement The NCAA is also investigating the situation. Miller, Temple’s leading scorer last season, transferred to Virginia Tech in April but was dismissed from the team on Oct. 23. The university stated Miller was dismissed from the program due to “circumstances prior to his enrollment at Virginia Tech.” Miller’s attorney, Jason P. Bologna, told The Athletic that Miller “fully cooperated” with the NCAA’s investigation. He declined to comment on the FBI investigation. “He sat for a five-hour interview and answered every question the NCAA asked,” Bologna said in an email. “He also produced every document the NCAA requested. Hysier did these things because he wanted to play basketball this season, and he is devastated that he cannot.” Temple President John Fry said in a letter to the university community Thursday that the school has not received requests for information from state or federal law enforcement but would “cooperate fully should we be contacted.” Fry said Temple has “been fully responsive and cooperative with the NCAA since the moment we learned of the investigation.” “We are aware of the deeply concerning allegations of sports wagering last season,” a Temple spokesperson said in a statement. “We take seriously the integrity of intercollegiate athletics as well as the education and well-being of our student-athletes. Temple is committed to doing the right thing no matter the circumstances.” The NCAA declined to comment. The FBI did not confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation, and did not comment further. The unusual wagering was first flagged by U.S. Integrity, a service that works with major sports leagues and sportsbooks. The company notified its customers that a betting line jumped considerably in the hours leading up to the Temple-UAB game on March 7. A message left with U.S. Integrity was not immediately returned. Advertisement UAB was initially a 2.5-point favorite on the morning of the game, and the line moved to 8 points before eventually settling at 7, according to BetQL, a website that tracks consensus line movement. UAB won the game, 100-72. When contacted last March, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board told The Athletic that it was “reviewing the matter in regards to any impact in Pennsylvania.” Miller did not miss any games because of the matter last season. “Hysier has overcome more adversity in his 22 years than most people face in their lifetime,” Bologna, his attorney, said. “He will meet and overcome whatever obstacles lay ahead.” (Photo of Hysier Miller (No. 3): Bob Levey / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Purdy took a hit to the shoulder during Sunday’s loss to the Seattle Seahawks. He did not mention it after the game and it was hard to tell if it bothered him during the contest. He completed 75 percent of his throws but did not attempt any passes beyond 20 yards. Kyle Shanahan said the lack of a deep passing game was due to the Seahawks’ two-deep coverage that encouraged shorter attempts. Advertisement “In terms of his throws, I didn’t see anything that looked any different and he didn’t complain about that in any way to me,” Shanahan said Thursday on his weekly radio interview on KNBR. Purdy was limited in Wednesday’s light practice, going through the motions alongside the rest of the quarterbacks but never actually throwing the ball. He was officially limited in Thursday’s session, too, although his practice was restricted to a few short throws before disappearing into the team’s weight room. “He didn’t do as much yesterday (and) did a little bit more today, but by no means was he doing his normal workload,” Shanahan said. “(He) went out there and did a little bit and went back in about halfway through and rested his arm up and just continued to get his rehab. Hopefully it will be feeling great on Sunday.” Purdy also did not speak to reporters after Thursday’s practice, the slot when the 49ers’ starting quarterback usually takes the podium. The 49ers said the starting quarterback – whoever he is – will talk on Friday. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Purdy has suffered several injuries since coming in for injured Jimmy Garoppolo in Week 13 two seasons ago. He hurt his ribs in the next game, notably didn’t practice during the week, then gritted his way through a Thursday night game in Seattle. He tore an elbow ligament in the NFC Championship game that season but came back earlier than expected and started the 2023 opener in Pittsburgh. He suffered a concussion in a Week 7 loss in Minnesota but started the following week against the Cincinnati Bengals. The only start he’s missed was last year’s meaningless season finale, a game a number of starters sat out. Christian McCaffrey said he wasn’t alarmed that Purdy missed most of practice. “For me, I’ve never worried about who’s in, especially on Thursday in practice,” he said. “I’ve seen enough guys not practice all week and go out and have incredible games. He’ll handle his business, we’ll all handle ours and just try to focus in on playing one play at a time and being where I’m supposed to be.” Advertisement If Purdy’s not able to play Sunday in Green Bay, backup Brandon Allen would get his first start in three years. He started three games for the Denver Broncos in 2019 and five for the Bengals the following season. The last time he was on the field to begin a game was the Bengals’ 2021 season finale. He was 15 of 29 for 136 yards and one touchdown in that game. He’s 2-7 in the games he’s started. Allen declined an interview at his locker after Thursday’s practice Allen served as the 49ers’ No. 3 quarterback behind Purdy and Sam Darnold last year and has gotten on the field just once this season – for a kneel-down snap at the end of a Week 1 win over the New York Jets. Allen and newcomer Joshua Dobbs battled for the No. 2 role during training camp. Dobbs seemed to be more aggressive with his throws and was undoubtedly the more talented runner. The 49ers tapped Allen for his efficiency and familiarity with the offense. Both have served as San Francisco’s scout-team quarterback – the one who mimics upcoming opponents in practice – this season. If Allen starts, Dobbs would serve as the No. 2 quarterback in Green Bay. The 49ers also could tap rookie Tanner Mordecai, who’s on the practice squad, as the emergency third quarterback. Purdy, McCaffrey (Achilles, rest) and George Kittle (hamstring) were limited participants in Thursday’s practice. Nick Bosa (hip/oblique) and Trent Williams (ankle) were among the 49ers who didn’t practice and Shanahan said both would be game-time decisions on Sunday.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani wins unanimous third MVP, first in the NL, after 50-50 season",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5930024/2024/11/21/dodgers-shohei-ohtani-unanimous-mvp/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 23:59:39 GMT",Ohtani and former Los Angeles Angels teammate Mike Trout are the only active players to have won the award at least three times.,"MLB Shohei Ohtani’s latest season was defined long before Thursday night, the night the Los Angeles Dodgers superstar won his third Most Valuable Player Award in unanimous fashion and became just the second player — along with Frank Robinson — to earn the honor in both leagues. Ohtani authored one of the finest individual performances in baseball history, slugging 54 home runs and swiping 59 bases to become the first-ever member of baseball’s 50-50 club while hitting .310 with a National League-leading 1.036 OPS. Despite exclusively appearing as a designated hitter and not playing the field, the 30-year-old won out against New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor, who had an .844 OPS while hitting 33 home runs and stealing 29 bases. Ohtani outproduced him by both Baseball-Reference (9.2 to 7.0) and FanGraphs’ (9.1 to 7.8) formulas for wins above replacement. Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte was an MVP finalist for the first time, with 36 home runs and a .932 OPS in 136 games. Advertisement Ohtani earned all 30 first-place votes from the Baseball Writers’ Association of America on his way to 420 points. Lindor finished second with 23 second-place votes and 263 points, while Marte finished third with five second-place votes and 229 points. “I’m very happy obviously to win the award,” Ohtani said through interpreter Matt Hidaka. “My goal was to be able to pitch and contribute offensively. The fact that I knew I wasn’t going to be able to pitch this season just made me focus more on my offensive game. Fortunately, I was able to produce and get this award, which is very humbling.” Ohtani’s first season as a Dodger was full of upheaval. He had to endure a recovery from a second elbow ligament reconstruction, which limited him only to hitting. A flood of life circumstances — from joining his new club on a record contract to his marriage to the theft of tens of millions of dollars by his longtime interpreter — colored a year still defined by his brilliance. Things ended, fittingly, with what Ohtani sought most when deferring so much of that record contract to allow his new team to build around him: a World Series title. “He committed to us, and he wanted to play for a championship,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said in the celebration. “For it to kind of come to fruition in his first year is pretty remarkable. “What Shohei’s done to our ballclub, the Dodger fan base domestically, globally, I just don’t think you can quantify.” The Dodgers have already centered the next decade around Ohtani, from global business partnerships to how they will add stars to their already talent-laden roster. It took one year for the fruits of that vision to come to pass. Dodger Stadium was flooded with jerseys wearing Ohtani’s name. A club whittled down by injuries still managed to romp through October. Advertisement “It was definitely special as you said because we were able to win the World Series,” Ohtani said. “It will be a special moment that I will never forget just to be able to win MVP as an individual as well. But I take it as a team effort and this will motivate me even more to win again next year. We hope to win the World Series each year. “Moving forward, I do think we will have a target on our back and we will be expected to possibly do even more. But we are as a team going to continue to do the best we can and try to achieve those goals.” Thursday cemented more rare history. No player not named Ohtani had ever won a unanimous MVP so much as twice. He and Barry Bonds are the only MVPs to ever win the award, switch teams and then win it again in their first season with a new club. GO DEEPER The best Shohei Ohtani cards to collect after his historic 50/50 season He and his former Los Angeles Angels teammate, Mike Trout, are the only active players to have won the award at least three times, with only Bryce Harper and Aaron Judge joining them among active players to win the award more than once. For Ohtani, however, this one resonates for a different reason. He swapped out Angels red for Dodgers blue. And while it was his two-way excellence in the batter’s box and on the mound (and the novelty that brought) that led him to his first two MVPs and nearly won him a third while with the Angels, this year’s achievement came in a season where he didn’t throw a single pitch. His quest for a fourth already has its prologue: Ohtani is expected to return to the mound at some point in 2025, but he will do so while recovering from shoulder surgery to repair his left (non-throwing) labrum that he tore while attempting to steal a base against the New York Yankees in the World Series. Ohtani said Thursday that he has had his stitches removed and been cleared to start core and lower-body exercises. While he said it is his “goal” to return as both a hitter and pitcher for Opening Day, he said he and the Dodgers will exercise caution. Advertisement “The goal is to be ready for Opening Day,” Ohtani said. “That includes hitting and pitching. We are kind of taking our time. Obviously we want to make sure that I’m healthy first. We’re not going to rush anything. I think, discussing my shoulder, I think we are going to take a little bit more time and be conservative and we’re going to make sure I’m healthy before I step back on the mound.” (Top photo: Elsa / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The Washington Capitals star captain underwent further evaluation Thursday and was diagnosed with a left fibula fracture, the team announced. Ovechkin is expected to miss four to six weeks. Ovechkin, 39, was initially ruled week to week with a lower-body injury Tuesday following an accidental, knee-on-knee collision with Utah Hockey Club forward Jack McBain during Monday’s 6-2 victory. Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin underwent further evaluation with team doctors. It was confirmed that Ovechkin has a fracture to his left fibula and is anticipated to miss 4-6 weeks. — CapitalsPR (@CapitalsPR) November 21, 2024  Ovechkin, who is in pursuit of the NHL’s all-time goals record, has 15 goals and 10 assists in 18 games played so far this season. He sits at 868 career goals, just 27 shy of passing Wayne Gretzky’s record. That he will probably have to wait until next season to break Gretzky’s goal record. There aren’t many examples of athletes pushing 40 recovering smoothly from a lower-body injury as significant as a broken fibula. He’s no average athlete, but he is human — and he’ll need time to knock off rust, at the very least, and also work his way into game-level fitness upon returning from this injury. Advertisement With Ovechkin, the legs feed the wolf so to speak. He’s a brute force of a goal scorer, powering shots with his lower body. He’s appeared to be skating like a player at least five years younger this season — does that change when he returns from a broken bone? There’s no way to answer that question now. Still, even if he returns by early 2025, he’ll likely need a hot streak to pass Gretzky this season. His chance of the goal record was destined to become the story of the second half of this season — one that perhaps could generate interest the NHL has not seen, at least in the United States, in many years. He’s too close to the record not to get it eventually. But it looked like he might knock it off on his way to an improbable 50-goal season, if not a run at a fourth Hart Trophy. This was shaping up as a legacy-defining season for an all-time icon behind whom the NHL could potentially break into the mainstream sports conversation. All of that may be off the table because of this injury. — Rob Rossi, NHL senior writer The Capitals surprised many people by making the playoffs last season — and they did so largely in part to Ovechkin finding his scoring groove in the second half. Their emergence this season as a seeming dark horse Cup contender coincided with Ovechkin’s scoring surge. It was as if an improved roster was also being fueled by its captain’s finishing form. There’s no way to overstate how big a blow losing Ovechkin is to the Capitals, though. Even when he’s not scoring, if he’s on the ice, he’s a threat who draws opponents’ top defensive pairings and often best defensive forwards. And on the power play, where he’s arguably the most dangerous weapon the NHL has known, Ovechkin is irreplaceable. The Capitals are more than just Ovechkin, but not having him for at least a month — and it’s totally unknown how he’ll look when he does return — is as significant an obstacle as any team has faced this season. — Rossi (Photo: Patrick Smith / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Advertisement Landing Underwood is by far the biggest coup of the class and one of Michigan’s biggest recruiting wins in years. Underwood will be the highest-rated quarterback to sign with Michigan in the modern recruiting era (dating back to 2002) and the second player ranked No. 1 in his class to do so, joining Rashan Gary from the Class of 2016.     A post shared by Bryce Underwood (@19bryce.__)  Jim Harbaugh’s reluctance to engage in bidding wars for recruits was one reason Michigan was perceived as a long shot in Underwood’s recruitment. Michigan wasn’t viewed as a serious player in the Underwood sweepstakes when he committed to LSU in January, and Belleville coach Calvin Norman told The Athletic in June that there would be no last-minute change of heart from Underwood. “That’s not gonna happen,” Norman said. Michigan ramped up its pursuit of Underwood in recent weeks, backed by a significant allocation of NIL resources. While the Wolverines have experienced a downturn on the field after last season’s national championship run, their 2025 recruiting class now sits at No. 9 in the composite rankings. “I think they understand the vision that we explain to them and what this is going to be like,” Moore said of players considering Michigan. “It’s been pretty positive. We’ve gotten some good commitments, some good guys to join the family, and we’re looking to continue that trend.” GO DEEPER What Michigan flipping the nation's No. 1 recruit means for Sherrone Moore The state of Michigan has produced a string of elite quarterback prospects in recent years, including Notre Dame’s CJ Carr and Dante Moore, now at Oregon. After missing out on Carr and Moore, the Wolverines have staked a big part of their future on Underwood, a 6-foot-4 prodigy with the tools to be a future franchise quarterback in the NFL. “He’s a more modernized Randall Cunningham mixed with Josh Allen,” Donovan Dooley, Underwood’s QB coach, told The Athletic in 2023. “He’s a unicorn.” Advertisement J.J. McCarthy’s departure for the NFL left a hole at quarterback that became glaring during Moore’s first season. Michigan had a commitment from four-star quarterback Carter Smith for 2025, but Smith decommitted after Michigan went all in with Underwood. Given the struggles of Davis Warren and Alex Orji this season, Underwood will be a candidate to start immediately in 2025, though he could have competition from redshirt freshman Jadyn Davis and any quarterback Michigan elects to pursue in the transfer portal. The Tigers may be in trouble. Underwood had been committed to LSU since January, and it’s typical for college programs to shut down quarterback recruiting once they have their guy in place. LSU now doesn’t have a quarterback in its class with less than two weeks until the start of the early signing period. Additionally, Brian Kelly and his staff are now at risk of losing other top prospects. It was no secret that the Tigers had built their class around Underwood, and it wouldn’t be surprising if some of the other skill players jumped ship. On3 has already projected that four-star wide receiver Derek Meadows, who plays at Las Vegas Bishop Gorman, will follow suit and flip from LSU to Michigan. Kelly, whose team is just 6-4 this season, may now have to turn to the portal to fill some of these holes.

Judge earned his second American League MVP award, this one unanimously, on Thursday night, claiming it after posting an astounding 218 wRC+, the highest ever recorded by a right-handed hitter in either league. Judge received all 30 first-place votes from the Baseball Writers’ Association of America to finish with 420 points, well ahead of second-place Kansas City Royals shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. (270 points). Judge’s teammate Juan Soto (229 points) finished third. Advertisement Judge, who also won the honor when he hit an AL-record 62 home runs in 2022, didn’t appear on a scheduled conference call with members of the BBWAA after the award announcement Thursday night. He did, however, appear on MLB Network and ESPN. On Friday afternoon, Judge and BBWAA President Jack O’Connell each said Judge hadn’t been informed of the call, and then Judge spoke with reporters for approximately 20 minutes. Judge became the seventh player in Yankees history to win multiple MVPs, joining Alex Rodriguez, Mickey Mantle (three times), Roger Maris, Yogi Berra (three times), Joe DiMaggio (three times) and Lou Gehrig. “It’s funny. I was talking to (Bryce) Harper a lot this season, and I was telling him, ‘I’m going to try to catch up to you with these MVPs here, man,’” Judge said on MLB Network, referring to Harper’s two MVP awards. “But he’s saying hopefully he could stay a few ahead of me, which I think he’ll do, man. It means a lot. A lot of the hard work in the offseason, during the season, the ups and downs throughout it. The constant support from my teammates, the fans in New York, just everybody to help me get to this spot.” Judge finished the 2024 season with a majors-leading 58 home runs and 144 RBIs, and a slash line of .322/.458/.701. His 11.2 fWAR ranked as the 10th-best single-season performance in franchise history and the 19th-best of all time. The 6-foot-7 center fielder was so dominant that his .701 slugging percentage was higher than the OPS of 11 teams. “It’s greatness right in front of us,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said in September while describing Judge. GO DEEPER The best Aaron Judge trading cards to collect Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora in September called Judge’s performance “the best version” of his nine-year career. Judge led MLB in home runs, RBIs, walk rate, ISO, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, wOBA, wRC+, and fWAR. The campaign was statistically better overall than his 2022. He did it while hitting behind Soto, who put up a career year with 41 home runs and is poised to land one of the biggest contracts in free-agent history this winter. Advertisement Asked on MLB Network if it mattered to him that he won MVP unanimously, Judge said, “No, not really. I appreciate all the votes, all the support. If you win it, you win it. But, honestly, I wouldn’t be in this position without my teammates, all the coaching we had this year. It’s such a blessing. I’ve got to thank God every day for this opportunity to be here, to wear pinstripes and to do it in New York.” Judge also led MLB in Statcast’s run value metric against four-seam fastballs, sinkers and sweepers. Despite facing the highest volume of sweepers among all hitters, he slugged an incredible .816 against the pitch. Over the past two seasons, pitchers have frequently attacked Judge with sliders, hoping he would chase pitches off the plate. In 2024, Judge also faced the most sliders of his career. He responded with a remarkable .984 OPS against all types of sliders. Judge is a perfectionist, constantly seeking ways to refine even the smallest aspects of his game as evidenced by the tweaks he made to his swing this season. Topping his 2024 output will be no easy feat, but if he does, another MVP trophy could bear his name.  (Photo: Jason Miller / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

(via @awnaveed11) pic.twitter.com/1SxBGVbNJq — USMNT Only (@usmntonly) November 19, 2024  The ‘Trump Dance’ has become a viral trend after being widely used by Trump himself on the presidential election campaign trail. That has now spread to sports, with National Football League player Nick Bosa celebrating a sack using the dance, and most recently combat sports fighter Jon Jones performing it after knocking out his opponent, in front of a watching Trump. But Howard, widely-considered among the greatest players in the history of American men’s soccer, criticised Pulisic, calling into question his awareness surrounding the political climate in the United States following the U.S. election, where Trump earned a second term by roundly defeating Democratic challenger and current Vice President Kamala Harris. “Doing a dance that mimics (U.S. president-elect) Donald Trump is stupid,” Howard wrote in the UK’s Daily Mail. “Why? Because, whether it’s the president of the United States or my neighbor down the street, I would never back someone who I believe is racist. I wouldn’t glorify that. I wouldn’t do it for anything.” Referring to Pulisic’s insistence that the dance was not a “political” act, Howard said: “That explanation doesn’t wash. You cannot have it both ways. You’re on one side of this or the other. If you are bold enough to publicly make a statement, I don’t have a problem with that. But own it.” Advertisement Howard also attacked the U.S. Soccer Federation, suggesting that it needed to do a better job of educating its players on the ramifications of their actions. The former Everton keeper also stated that he felt some athletes were ignoring problematic policies and political leanings in order to maximize their earnings. “Athletes know they can protect their assets by supporting a certain political party,” wrote Howard. “I have a lot of friends who are very wealthy and they sold their soul to protect their money. “Support whoever you want, for whatever reason you like. But my message to Pulisic, Bosa, Jones and Co? Own it.” U.S. Soccer declined to comment on Howard’s remarks. President-elect Trump’s office has been approached for comment.

Forest head coach Nuno Espirito Santo said the midfielder is still struggling with the foot injury he sustained against Crystal Palace last month. Anderson, 22, started the subsequent game against Leicester City and came off the bench in the last two Forest fixtures, against West Ham United and Newcastle United. Advertisement “We took advantage of the international break to try to manage some players who were struggling, and Elliot was one of them. Let’s see how he is tomorrow. But for now, we still have to assess him,” said Nuno at his pre-match press conference earlier on Thursday. The Portuguese coach said that, otherwise, Forest’s international players had all — with the exception of Paraguay international Ramon Sosa, who was yet to fly back to England — arrived back in Nottingham without injury issues. But both Murillo and Chris Wood will be given more rest ahead of the weekend, having travelled half way around the world to join up with Brazil and New Zealand. Murillo did not get any game time as Brazil drew 1-1 both in Venezuela and at home to Uruguay. But Wood scored twice in an 8-1 win over Vanuatu and a hat-trick as New Zealand won in Samoa. Nuno says the training levels of all the international players — and particularly Murillo and Wood — will be monitored to ensure they get as much rest as possible ahead of the weekend. “We will give them more time to rest. This is what we believe is better. We will not immediately try to prepare them. We will have players with jetlag and we have to manage that. Our approach is always that doing less is more,” said Nuno. (Mike Egerton/PA Images via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Advertisement The system won’t be installed in every spring ballpark, but all teams will have opportunities to play with it. MLB has tested two types of ABS in the minors: one that was used by umpires on every pitch, and another where teams had either two or three challenges per game. The league expects to give teams two challenges per game in spring training. At the end of 2024 in the minors, MLB started testing two challenges rather than three, and it wants to continue looking at that setup. Teams retain the challenge when they are correct, and so three challenges could amount to a higher volume of in-game stoppages.

And we’re gonna have to sort through both of those.” Manfred also has to collectively bargain a new contract with major league umpires, whose contract expired after the season, and the automated strike zone is a part of that negotiation. “We’re going to have to work through that issue as well,” Manfred said.

Alexander suffered the initial injury late in the Packers’ win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 8 and missed Green Bay’s Week 9 game against the Detroit Lions. The Packers had a Week 10 bye and Alexander played only 10 defensive snaps against the Chicago Bears last Sunday before leaving the game and not returning. He practiced in a limited capacity each day last week and was listed as questionable for the game before playing. Advertisement Coach Matt LaFleur said Monday that Alexander was on a pitch count entering Sunday’s game, anyway, but that Alexander felt like he couldn’t play more than 10 snaps. “I stayed here the whole bye week trying to hopefully come back and make an impact for the team,” Alexander said. “It was a game-time decision at that, so we didn’t know … until, you know, a few minutes before the game if I would play or not. “I just tried to give it a go … I went out there and s–t, all I could really give was 10 plays and then it — I felt something. If you know how (posterior cruciate ligaments) work, it don’t just get done in three weeks, so it just needed more time. I reaggravated it going back out there and only doing 10 plays, so now we just trying to get my knee back right.” LIVE: Head Coach Matt LaFleur meets with the media 🎙️  https://t.co/iAscgcjASx — Green Bay Packers (@packers) November 21, 2024  Alexander, a second-team All-Pro in 2020 and 2022, was asked if he could return to that form at some point in the second half of this season. “Yessir. Oh, heck yeah. Of course,” he said. “You know, I just need more than 21 days of non-contact. It just needed more time because to take three weeks off and not do much, that still wasn’t enough.” So what exactly is he looking at for a return timetable? “I don’t know,” Alexander said. “I got a meeting today with everybody, so we gon’ kinda go and see what’s the best decision, so that’s all.” Alexander has missed 27 of a potential 61 regular-season games since the start of the 2021 season, with 26 of those due to various injuries. He missed 13 games with a shoulder injury in 2021, one game with a groin injury in 2022 and then three games with a back injury in 2023. Alexander missed Weeks 3 and 4 last season with the back injury and knew it was hurting entering a Week 5 game against former teammate Davante Adams and the Raiders, but, as Alexander said Thursday, he “had to play” and did so for all 64 defensive snaps in Las Vegas. He missed Week 6 with the same back injury. Alexander then missed six games later in the season with a shoulder injury, one while suspended, two more this season with a groin injury and now one and counting with his PCL injury. Advertisement Alexander has been an All-Pro in the last two seasons he’s played at least 15 games, but staying on the field has been a challenge for the $21 million-per-year cornerback who signed that then-record four-year extension in the 2022 offseason. “You’re talking about an elite player at his position, so it definitely is tough when he’s not out there,” LaFleur said. “That’s the case for a lot of teams in this league, missing players, and you’ve got to have the next guy step up, be ready to go and can never let that standard slip.” Edgerrin Cooper a new DNP at practice, which is indoors today.

Jones was benched on Monday in favor of Tommy DeVito as the last-place Giants enter Week 12 at 2-8. Jones spent a portion of Thursday’s session wearing a red scout team jersey and afterward took accountability for his part in leading just one winning season since his arrival in 2019. Advertisement “The opportunity to play for the New York Giants was truly a dream come true. I’m extremely grateful to the Mara and Tisch families for the chance to play here,” Jones said. “No one wanted to win more games worse than me. I gave everything I had on the field and in preparation. Of course, this season has been disappointing for all and of course, I wish I could have done more. I’m 100% accountable for my part. I did not play well enough, consistently enough to help the team get (good) results.” Jones, currently in the second season of the four-year, $160 million contract extension signed in 2022, acknowledged that he’s “still processing” whether he’ll remain with the team for the rest of the season. GO DEEPER The Daniel Jones era is over. Giants bench QB after frustrating 6-year run The 27-year-old did confirm, though, that his $23 million injury guarantee contributed to the team’s decision to sit him. “I want to play. I want to be on the field. I tried to do as much as I could to make that possible and create a situation where we were both comfortable,” Jones said when asked whether he considered waiving the guarantee. “Unfortunate business side of the game.” With the expectation that he has played his final snap in a Giants uniform, Jones expressed excitement over his next opportunity. “I know there’s a lot of good football in front of me,” he said. Still, Jones was visibly emotional at points, particularly when thanking his teammates, coaches, staffers and fans. “To all the fans, I have deep respect and appreciation for your passion and love for the Giants. The fans are a huge part of what makes playing for the Giants so special.” It was strange to see Jones in a red scout-team pinnie lining up at safety during a walk-through period early in Thursday’s practice. But that’s the quarterback’s new reality, as he has dropped to fourth on the depth chart after the Giants benched him this week. Advertisement The Giants are essentially putting Jones in bubble wrap to avoid risking the $23 million injury guarantee in his contract, so he’s not participating in any live periods of practice. But Jones stood in at safety as the offensive line and quarterbacks prepped for the blitzes they’ll see from the Buccaneers on Sunday. Jones was joined on the ragtag scout team defense by practice squad offensive linemen and members of the coaching staff. That figures to be the extent of Jones’ practice participation for the final seven weeks of the season, unless he and the team reach an agreement to send him home. – Dan Duggan, Giants senior writer (Photo: Luke Hales / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

As part of expansive negotiations under way between multiple stakeholders to dramatically change how the NBA All-Star Game looks, one issue to be ironed out is who coaches the up to four teams that might compete in a tournament-style competition on All-Star Sunday. Advertisement As The Athletic first reported earlier this month, the NBA is considering sweeping changes to its All-Star Game that would be implemented in February, following several years of a disappointing on-court product by the league’s top players. A four-team tournament setting is likely, multiple league sources said, with three teams of eight NBA All-Stars and a fourth team of rookies and sophomores who win the Rising Stars Challenge on All-Star Friday. The format being strongly considered would match the Rising Stars format, in which teams would play to a target score of 40 in a tournament semifinal and 25 in the championship — both of which would be held on All-Star Sunday in lieu of a traditional East versus West All-Star Game with 12-minute quarters. The league, players’ union, coaches and team executives are still ironing out all of the details, including prize money doled out to winners and losers of the tournament and how the teams are selected. When it comes to who coaches the four teams, numerous league officials agree the coach of the top team in each respective conference will direct two of the four All-Star teams. According to two team officials with direct knowledge of league discussions to this point, staffs from the top two teams in each conference could be involved on All-Star Sunday, but other league sources said that option had not been discussed with all stakeholders. In another scenario being discussed, the coach of the Rising Stars team that advances from Friday’s competition to Sunday would retain its coach – likely an assistant from one of the top two NBA teams’ staffs – and it was unknown who the coach of the third All-Star team might be. As of Thursday, Kenny Atkinson has the Cleveland Cavaliers in first place in the East, with the best overall record in the NBA. The top team in the West is the Golden State Warriors, coached by Steve Kerr. The second place team in the East is the Boston Celtics, coached by Joe Mazzulla, and the second place team in the West is the Oklahoma City Thunder, coached by Mark Daigneault. Advertisement Under the league’s new collective bargaining contract with the players’ union, players on the winning team at the All-Star Game would receive $100,000 and players on the losing side would receive $25,000. However, that agreement was struck before the league began serious discussions with players – including, notably, perennial All-Star and likely host for the 2025 game, Stephen Curry – about changing the format. If the Rising Stars format is adopted for the NBA All-Star Game, as expected, there would be more than one losing team.

He even accepted some of the blame for the outcome. Then, he stopped mincing his words and gave his true feelings about Toronto Maple Leafs’ Ryan Reaves crushing him with a head hit last Saturday. “He came after and apologized,” Nurse said after Thursday’s morning skate, the first time he’s been on the ice since the incident. “In situations like that, there’s definitely an onus on the player with the puck to be aware of where everyone else is on the ice. Advertisement “With that said, even if you put yourself in a bad spot, there is lots of body in a 6-foot-4 hockey player to hit and not one piece was touched other than my head. You can argue about the intent, but there are certain guys in the league that every shift they go out there and they go out and try to inflict pain. I think it’s pretty obvious what’s going on there.” Reaves was given a match penalty at 2:41 of the second period of an eventual 4-3 overtime win by the Maple Leafs when his attempted check made direct contact with Nurse’s head. Nurse was left woozy and bloodied and remained on the ice as the officials reviewed the play and confirmed the penalty call. He needed help from Edmonton’s head athletic therapist T.D. Forss and winger Mattias Janmark to get to the dressing room. Reaves, who has 1,093 penalty minutes in 893 NHL games, was issued a five-game suspension the next day. Toronto’s Ryan Reaves has been suspended for five games for an illegal check to the head against Edmonton’s Darnell Nurse. https://t.co/GyVuA2TLmG — NHL Player Safety (@NHLPlayerSafety) November 17, 2024  Nurse said he remembers the hit and is feeling better, but the sclera of his right eye was noticeably red. He was also sporting a black eye. Nurse won’t play Thursday when the Oilers host the Minnesota Wild. Coach Kris Knoblauch said Nurse might return to the lineup Saturday when they face the New York Rangers. After Saturday’s game, the Oilers are off until next Friday when they visit Utah for the first time. “With these things, (the) timeline is up to multiple people, so what I feel sometimes isn’t indicative of what’s going to happen,” Nurse said. “I’m just going to take it a day at a time. I haven’t looked too far ahead. If I’m feeling good, I always want to be out there. We’ll see how it goes.” Advertisement The especially unfortunate part for the Oilers and Nurse is that he was playing some of his best hockey of the season. Nurse had a three-point outing last Thursday against the Nashville Predators, including two goals and the game winner in overtime. Nurse has two goals and nine points with a plus-2 rating this season. His 20:49 average ice time ranks third on the team for blueliners behind Evan Bouchard and Mattias Ekholm and fifth overall behind Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl. The Oilers called up blueliner Josh Brown from AHL Bakersfield on Sunday. Brown played his first two games for Edmonton on Monday and Tuesday. The Oilers sent him down on Wednesday but recalled him on Thursday. “Frustration is what you make of the situation,” Nurse said. “Any situation that you’re in you can be frustrated about it, but it’s an injury and it’s part of the job. “You’re going to go out there and things are going to happen and sometimes you’re going to get injured. You have to do whatever you can to get back to 100 percent and get out there and be as effective as you can be.” Nurse said this is the first time he’s sustained a head injury in his career. The Oilers are also missing wingers Viktor Arvidsson and Zach Hyman due to undisclosed injuries. Arvidsson has missed the last four games, which will likely extend to at least six. He won’t play Thursday and isn’t expected to dress on Saturday. Knoblauch said Hyman will be out four to seven days. The Oilers claimed winger Kasperi Kapanen off waivers from St. Louis on Tuesday. They also recalled winger Drake Caggiula from the minors on Wednesday. Both are scheduled to play against the Wild – Kapanen with Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Jeff Skinner, and Caggiula with Derek Ryan and Corey Perry.

The Athletic exclusively reported on Tuesday that the 53-year-old had agreed fresh terms on a new deal to take him past 10 years service for the Premier League club, with his previous contract due to expire at the end of the current campaign. Advertisement City are on a run of four straight defeats in all competitions and Guardiola said he wanted to stay and help “turn the situation” around. “I want to be honest, I thought this (season) should be the last one. But the problems we had in the last month, I felt now was not the time to leave. I didn’t want to let the club down,” he said. He added: “Manchester City means so much to me. This is my ninth season here, we have experienced so many amazing times together. I have a really special feeling for this football club. That is why I am so happy to be staying for another two more seasons. “I have said this many times before, but I have everything a manager could ever wish for, and I appreciate that so much. Hopefully now we can add more trophies to the ones we have already won. That will be my focus.” Guardiola arrived at the Etihad Stadium in July 2016 and has masterminded an unprecedented period of success since then. The Spaniard has won 18 trophies during his time in English football, including six Premier League titles — second in the all-time list behind former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson (13). In 2022-23, he helped City become only the second English side after Ferguson’s 1998-99 team to win the Treble — comprising the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Colorado’s 2-way star Travis Hunter plans to enter next year's NFL Draft, play both WR and CB",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938396/2024/11/21/travis-hunter-nfl-draft-comments/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:09:39 GMT","The 6-foot-1, 185-pound junior WR and cornerback for the Buffaloes also said he intends to play on both sides of the ball at the next level.","NCAAF In the least stunning news of the 2024 season, Heisman Trophy frontrunner and likely No. 1 overall pick in next year’s NFL Draft Travis Hunter confirmed that this will indeed be his last year in college football. In a conference call with media members Thursday, Colorado’s dynamic two-way superstar confirmed he is bound for the NFL in 2025. The 6-foot-1, 185-pound junior wide receiver and cornerback for the Buffaloes also said he intends to play on both sides of the ball at the next level. Hunter’s 2024 Heisman campaign received a boost in last weekend’s 49-24 win over Utah. Advertisement The Colorado star hauled in his third interception of the year, had his first rushing touchdown of the year and had five catches for 55 yards. He also had a highlight-reel snag in triple coverage that was yet another Heisman moment for college football’s most unique player. In 2024, Hunter leads the Buffaloes with 911 yards on 74 receptions and nine receiving touchdowns. Before Colorado improved to 8-2 with the win over Utah on its roll toward a Big 12 Conference title game appearance, Colorado head coach Deion Sanders was asked on FOX’s “Big Noon Kickoff” if he had to choose to give a Heisman vote to Hunter or his son, Buffaloes quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who would he choose. Deion said it would go to Hunter. After his performance against the Utes, Deion doubled down. “Travis is who he is,” Sanders said. “It’s supposed to go to the best college football player. I think that’s been a wrap since, what, Week 2?” A former five-star high school recruit, Hunter decommitted from Florida State — Sanders’ alma mater — nearly three years ago and chose to play for Sanders at Jackson State in 2022 before following Sanders to Boulder. Hunter’s declaration is the least surprising thing we’ve seen all year. The Colorado dynamo started gaining traction as the country’s No. 1 prospect on scouting boards early this season. Nothing about that has slowed, as Hunter’s college run (especially the two FBS seasons) as a full-time two-way skill player is really unlike anything we’ve ever seen in modern college football. Charles Woodson won a Heisman Trophy in 1997 as a defensive player who played sparingly on offense. Hunter rarely misses a snap and has been the best player on both sides of the ball in every college game in which he’s worn a helmet. Whether he’ll be selected with the first pick in the draft remains to be seen, as several NFL teams remain desperate for a QB. However, it’s hardly impossible that Hunter becomes either the first wide receiver to go No. 1 since Keyshawn Johnson (1996) or the first-ever CB to land the top spot. Advertisement Everyone has questions about whether the two-way business can continue in the NFL. Though it’s not foolish to suggest Hunter could be a team’s top corner while spending some time as an offensive gimmick/returner. I’m also not going to doubt him just yet, as he’s pretty unique. — Nick Baumgardner, senior writer  (Photo: Christian Petersen / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How the F1 drivers press conferences played out in Las Vegas,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/f1-vegas-2024-live-updates-latest-press-conferences/zgixUDPi72oM/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:35:20 GMT","The Formula One circus arrived for media day, ahead of round 22 of the 2024 world championship this weekend","Formula One is in Nevada for round 22 of the 2024 world championship, at Las Vegas Strip Circuit where Max Verstappen could clinch his fourth drivers’ championship. Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here Jeff Gluck/The Athletic For those who had to leave their pets at home, a free souvenir opportunity inside the paddock: A dog tag maker called “Pup Position.” Inside an oversized dog house placed between the Ferrari and McLaren hospitality areas, people are lining up to bring a little piece of the Las Vegas Grand Prix back to Fido. Advertisement Getty Images Today is media day in Las Vegas, meaning F1 has teed up a few figures to speak at its media conferences ahead of the racing. The teams and other parties will have their own media sessions planned too, but here is who F1 has lined up:  Today — drivers Tomorrow — team principals Let’s see what everyone has to say, and if there are any late changes to the lineup… Getty Images Zhou Guanyu doesn’t know which color he’ll be wearing in the Formula One paddock next year, though he knows it won’t be Sauber’s green and black colors after the announcement last week that the Chinese driver’s tenure with the team is ending at the end of the current season. “You will see me in the paddock, which color I don’t know,” Zhou said. “I’ll leave that to be seen.” Although Zhou’s plans aren’t yet finalized for 2025, he is confident he will have a place in the sport in some capacity, likely as a reserve driver. He is seeking that role to vault himself into a position to return full-time in 2026, aided by an extensive testing program as part of the role. “I feel like I'm in a position to not rush to make that decision because I need to make sure I’m with a team that can give me a chance to maybe having a seat back, and then also a team that I can continue to grow as a driver,” Zhou said. “So we need to take a bit more time, it won't be decided in the next month.” Sauber is completely overhauling its driver lineup in 2025, with both Zhou and Valtteri Bottas exiting. Replacing Zhou and Bottas are Nico Hülkenberg and Formula 2 championship leader Gabriel Bortoleto. Bortoleto is among a sizable group of drivers with less than a full year’s experience who are set to be on the grid next year. That influx is factoring into Zhou’s decision to pursue a reserve driver role, with the thinking that one (or more) of these young drivers may underperform to the point where their team decides to make a move. “There's a lot of opportunities that could happen for ‘26 onwards,” Zhou said. “I still want to stay here in a reserve role … hopefully waiting for a good opportunity to come back.” Luke Smith Good day from Las Vegas, where my body is currently trying to work out what time it actually is!  We’re on PST, but effectively on Japanese time due to the night race — meaning there’s been a split in approach among most people I’ve spoken to.  Do you try to stay up late, or go to bed at a ‘normal-ish’ time? I really have no idea, still. The timezone challenge was immense last year, particularly after second practice got delayed so much it did not finish until 4am. This year it should be a little easier, given FP2 and qualifying are now scheduled for 10pm instead of midnight. But the race remains a 10pm start, meaning we'll be working long into the small hours of Sunday morning. I’ve been out for a walk along the Strip, and it’s looking more and more like a race track. The organizers in Vegas do a terrific job to keep the roadways as open as possible to ensure traffic can flow before then closing them to prepare for the on-track sessions.  There are plenty of fans around wearing all kinds of merch. It’s nice to see so much interest and support here for the race.  As usual, F1 tire provider Pirelli has assessed what’s in store for the field in Las Vegas from its headquarters in Milan — and it makes for interesting reading. With the Nevadan track being the second longest on the 2024 calendar behind Spa-Francorchamps, and the Mojave desert temperature drop for the nighttime race, Pirelli expects the cars to run in air temperatures of around 10C (50 degrees Fahrenheit). It will also be a similar track temperature. In short, it’s going to be cold. Those temperatures and visiting a street circuit allows Pirelli to use its softest compound tires, and it expects most cars to take on a two-stop strategy come the race — although a one-stop will remain an option for those teams who are confident they can make it work.  Pirelli also suggests that going longer with the first stint of the race — basically putting off your first pit stop as long as possible — will be more beneficial than trying to go longer at the end, because it will take a while to get the tires up to their ideal operating temperature from off the grid.  If you’ve read this far, make sure you take a closer look at Pirelli’s preview graphic, attached above.  Getty Images The prospect of Max Verstappen clinching his fourth world championship at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, F1’s glitziest race, is exciting for the sport. Verstappen will secure the title with two rounds to spare if he can finish ahead of Lando Norris on Saturday night or if Norris fails to outscore him by three points. Preparations are already being made by officials behind the Las Vegas Grand Prix in conduction with Red Bull in the event that Verstappen was to wrap up the title. I spoke earlier today with Renee Wilm, the CEO of the Las Vegas Grand Prix, and Emily Prazer, the chief commercial officer of F1 and the Las Vegas Grand Prix, who stayed tight-lipped on plans but confirmed things are in motion. “Emily is never without an idea for a spectacle,” Wilm said, teeing up Prazer to explain her thinking. “I obviously work really closely with the Red Bull team across the board, whether it's hospitality or marketing or whatever,” Prazer said. “So we called them, we said, let's have a chat about what this looks like if you win. Obviously, we're in Vegas, so we want to help you put on a huge party. “There's mixed thoughts on that from their camp, but we have a significant plan as you'd expect. I don't want to ruin it, though … Just watch out for the Bellagio fountains.” GO FURTHER How Max Verstappen can win the drivers’ championship in Las Vegas and light up F1’s glitziest race Advertisement  When a loose water valve cover wrecked the underside of Carlos Sainz’s Ferrari and canceled the opening practice session after just eight minutes last year, F1’s $650 million bet on bringing the sport to Las Vegas looked risky. From then on, the weekend was deemed a huge success.  Which brings us to year two, with Vegas now lacking the novelty and unknowns of its inaugural race. That is why they listened to feedback and put together a playbook for this second visit — in the words of Las Vegas GP CEO Renee Wilm: 💬 “I wouldn’t say it’s easier in year two. But it is a significantly different experience.” You can read up on the road Vegas has taken from last year to this, with an excellent piece from Luke Smith below. You’ll enjoy this one.    GO FURTHER F1 prepares for Las Vegas GP’s second year: ‘Now we have a playbook’  The U.S. was back in the F1 spotlight come October, as Texas’ Circuit of The Americas hosted the 2024 United States Grand Prix.  It started in ominous fashion, with Red Bull’s upgrades delivering a dominant sprint race victory for Max Verstappen — his first F1 win of any kind in 112 days. But that pace didn’t carry into the grand prix sessions. Lando Norris delivered a stunning lap in an aborted Q3 to claim pole for McLaren, before Ferrari took the race by storm as Charles Leclerc blitzed his third victory of the year, with outgoing teammate Carlos Sainz just behind. The rest of the fun was saved for Norris and Verstappen, whose lengthy sparring ended with Norris’ late overtake of the Dutchman while both cars exceeded track limits. Verstappen picked up a warning, Norris got a five-second penalty for not handing back the position, and it was Red Bull who could celebrate the final podium spot.  GO FURTHER Charles Leclerc wins F1 U.S. Grand Prix, Lando Norris loses podium to late penalty  Las Vegas is the last of Formula One’s three visits to the United States in 2024. It all kicked off with the Miami Grand Prix back in May, where Max Verstappen took sprint and grand prix pole in qualifying — also dominating the sprint race. But the grand prix was a different matter, and a little piece of history for Lando Norris as the McLaren driver claimed his first F1 victory. That felt like quite the moment, given Norris went on to push Verstappen as his chief title rival during the year.   The inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix last year came with a lot of pre-race hype and razzmatazz — and then the track action trumped it all.  In a season of routine predictability, this race was as good as it got. Even Max Verstappen didn’t have things all his own way, penalized for forcing Charles Leclerc off the track at Turn 1 (we’d seen that move a few times before and since) — but then showing Red Bull’s dominance to claw his way back into the lead. Leclerc was supreme in pinching second off Sergio Perez in the final corners, while Esteban Ocon excelled in claiming fourth for Alpine.  A repeat of the action this year on F1’s second visit would be very welcome.

McLaren already had the lead heading into São Paulo and didn’t lose so much ground on Red Bull, mostly owing to another poor showing from Sergio Perez. Their 36-point lead over Ferrari is a decent platform, but even Red Bull in third will hope for a turnaround in fortunes that could yet see them come out on top for a third successive season.

GO FURTHER Indiana, Tennessee are on course for a CFP committee showdown, so let’s get a head start Danny Wild / Imagn Images No. 19 Army (9-0) vs. No. 6 (8-seed) Notre Dame (9-1). If undefeated Army pulls this off, it would be by far the most impressive win among G5 contenders (sorry, NIU, which has fallen to 6-4 overall and 3-3 in the MAC). Does this mean Army jumps Big 12 leaders No. 14 BYU and No. 16 Colorado to become the fifth-highest-ranked theoretical conference champ, kicking the Big 12 out of the Playoff entirely? No. 12 Boise State already swiped the 4-seed (for now) and neither the Cougars (at No. 21 Arizona State) nor the Buffs (at Kansas) have sleeper games this weekend. And for style points, the Black Knights already won the season’s best jersey reveal. As for the Fighting Irish, I find it hard to believe they’d survive a second loss, especially without a conference championship that could pick up the slack. No. 5 (7-seed) Indiana (7-0) at No. 2 (5-seed) Ohio State (9-1). We’ve approached the Hoosiers’ prove-it week as they travel to face their first ranked opponent of the season (and that strength of schedule could come back to bite them in a loss). Ohio State has won a Big Ten-record 29 consecutive games over the Hoosiers, with the last loss coming in 1988, but these Hoosiers look different. The winner here likely punches their ticket to the Big Ten Championship Game with a chance to play for a first-round CFP bye.   No. 12 Boise State (9-1) gets a bye! BYU took a nose dive from No. 6 to No. 14 after losing to Kansas, which keeps it as the highest-ranked Big 12 team … but the fifth-highest-ranked hypothetical conference champ. That means No. 12 Boise State gets the first-round bye as the Mountain West champ. Although it didn’t affect seeding, BYU was also ranked behind No. 13 SMU, which prompted the Big 12 to throw some shade. Advertisement  No. 11 Tennesse (8-2). A two-loss SEC team will likely be left out of the field, and for now, the committee projects that team as Tennessee. One gripe for Vols fans? Tennessee is ranked FIVE spots lower than an Alabama team it beat 24-17. And unfortunately for Tennessee, the opportunity for resume-building wins has likely expired with only UTEP and Vanderbilt remaining. That means the Vols should be on upset alert for their fellow SEC brethren to open up a spot in the field. No. 10 (11-seed) Georgia (8-2) is back in after one week on the bubble. The Dawgs won their way in with a 31-17 win against Tennessee and look to be in good shape with only UMass and Georgia Tech remaining. As for the Vols, that game against Georgia looked just as much like a CFP eliminator to the committee as we thought.  Jeff Hanisch / Imagn Images Big Ten: Oregon (1), Ohio State (2), Penn State (4), Indiana (5), Illinois (25) SEC: Texas (3), Alabama (7), Ole Miss (9), Georgia (10), Tennessee (11), Texas A&M (15), South Carolina (18), Missouri (23) Independent: Notre Dame (6) ACC: Miami (8), SMU (13), Clemson (17) Mountain West: Boise State (12), UNLV (24) Big 12: BYU (14), Colorado (16), Arizona State (21), Iowa State (22) AAC: Army (19), Tulane (20)  UNLV is ranked in the College Football Playoff rankings for the first time ever. The conversation nobody’s having yet is that Texas probably shouldn’t end up in the field if the Longhorns lose at Texas A&M in the regular-season finale. Texas has no top-25 wins and will have lost both its games to top-15 opponents. That’s a resume that should be behind Alabama, Ole Miss and Georgia, especially since those first two beat Georgia and Georgia beat Texas. AND then Texas A&M would also have to be ahead of the Longhorns. Would the committee really drop a team from No. 3 to out? I don’t know. But the Longhorns don’t have much to stand on if they don’t beat the Aggies. Advertisement ACC's spots in the rankings.  Big 12's spots in the rankings I suspect if the eventual Big 12 champion wins out through the conference title game — whether that’s BYU, Colorado, Iowa State or Arizona State — that it would likely jump a Boise State team that wins the Mountain West and ultimately would earn the Big 12 a first-round bye. But I also think it would be totally fair for the one-loss Broncos, whose only loss is to Oregon on a last-second field goal, to finish ahead of the Big 12 winner (and/or a non-Miami ACC champ?) with one of those top 4 seeds.      Big Ten's spots in the rankings. Why is Miami at No. 8? Its best win is at Louisville, and the Cardinals just lost to Stanford. Miami also lost to Georgia Tech. I have the Hurricanes at No. 14 in my The Athletic 134 rankings, behind SMU, which is playing better, has the same good wins against Louisville and Duke and lost to a top-15 team in BYU. Is this just an eye test thing? I still think the ACC ultimately ends up with one bid so this may not matter, but Miami’s seeding could impact the seeding of the ACC champion. Advertisement Dale Zanine / Imagn Images Tennessee would be the first at-large team left out, and I’m OK with that. The Vols’ loss to Arkansas is a significant stain on their resume. Nonconference scheduling hasn’t seemed to play a major role yet in the weekly rankings, but I wonder if that could have been a deciding factor in favor of Tennessee if North Carolina State had been better. Now the question is whether a win over mighty Vanderbilt can boost the Vols’ standing enough. That’s college football in 2024, all right.      Big 12 is throwing shade. It would appear the selection committee puts a lot of stock in the eye test. That’s the only justification for where one-loss Texas, Penn State, Notre Dame and Miami are ranked compared to one-loss Boise State, SMU and BYU are ranked. But none of that justifies why Texas and Penn State are ranked ahead of a dominant and undefeated Indiana. If the Hoosiers get smoked at Ohio State this Saturday, that changes things.

The 38-year-old lost his singles match in straight sets (4-6, 4-6) against Botic van de Zandschulp in, what turned out to be, the final match of his professional career. Fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz levelled the tie with a straight-sets win (7-6, 6-3) against Tallon Griekspoor, but Alcaraz and doubles partner Marcel Granollers lost both tiebreaks in the desperately close decider against Dutch duo Wesley Koolhof and Van de Zandschulp.

So even if Spain come back against the Netherlands today, it sounds like we have seen the last of the 22-time Grand Slam champion, at least in singles. Incidentally, Nadal has just come back into the arena to watch Alcaraz who is serving at *4-5 in a tight first set against Griekspoor. I can't think of too many better cheerleaders! Advertisement  The emotion of the day started early this morning when one of Nadal's greatest friends and certainly his greatest rival, Roger Federer, penned a lovely letter. The final match of Federer's career was a doubles match with Nadal at the 2022 Laver Cup, and he found all the right words to mark an emotional day. Getty Images All of the talk today will be about Rafa Nadal, and rightly so, but lots of credit must go to Botic van de Zandschulp. Early on, he looked awkward against a player who he claimed was an idol of his before the match, but he soon grew into the contest. And perhaps the best praise of the Dutchman was that he found his best stuff in almost every single one of the big points. That is the kind of praise we would have levelled at Nadal in years gone by, so Van de Zandschulp deserves tremendous credit in a unique atmosphere. Getty Images Nadal's record in Davis Cup matches is astonishing. Coming into today, he was on a streak of 32 consecutive wins in the competition across the singles and doubles event. And, in singles, his only defeat prior to today in 30 Davis Cup matches came when he was a 17-year-old playing his first-ever match in the 2004 tournament. His brilliant record at the Davis Cup — including five titles (2004, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2019) — ranks among the very best of his records in his glittering career. Getty Images And just because Nadal was beaten, it doesn't mean that the Spanish fans didn't enjoy themselves along the way. There were so many of his trademark fist pumps and roars of celebration, I think mostly in an attempt to get himself going. It worked a few times and, while the 38-year-old will rue a couple of simple misses, I'm sure he adored being back out there in front a home crowd. Getty Images In spite of that result, it has been one of the great days for the mostly Spanish crowd inside the arena in Malaga. They have been treated to potentially the last match of Rafa Nadal's career and are now watching the heir to his throne, Carlos Alcaraz. I, for one, am very jealous. And, if those Spanish fans in attendance get their way, they'll be seeing Alcaraz in action again later in the deiciding doubles match. Advertisement Getty Images Ask any player what they think of when they think of Nadal and they all say some version of the same thing — the ultimate competitor. That fire was all still there Tuesday, even as van de Zandschulp made it increasingly clear that he was going to be too tough an out for Nadal.  There Nadal was, down a set and 0-2 and desperate not to go down a double break, sprinting to the back of the court to catch up with a lob and fire back a desperate, spinning overhead as his body kept barrelling toward the back fence. Nadal came at him like the ocean. Van de Zandschulp stemmed his tide. Nadal, ultimately, was here for it as he always has been, healthy or not. It’s what kept him around, kept him trying to come back amid all the injuries. The big question he will have to answer beginning next week is how he can feed that hunger. Casper Ruud has said he is a terror on the golf course. He’s mad for the parchisi board game. Will that be enough? It’s hard to think so. Getty Images This was what the Malaga crowd had come to see, what some had paid thousands of euros for. Nadal playing singles, and for most of the first set, looking like he could deliver the win that almost everyone in the packed arena was willing into existence. The home supporters couldn’t have done much more. They went wild after every point Nadal won, and regularly serenaded him with chants of “Rafa, Rafa, Rafa!” When he clinched his first break of serve, more than 10,000 fans roared as if their man had just won a Grand Slam title. Credit must go to van de Zandschulp for staying so zen. Based just on his body language, it would have been tough to tell whether he was playing in arguably the biggest match of his career or against a friend in his local park. Credit too for the Dutch fans, who massed together in their distinctive orange made plenty of noise as they revelled in their nation’s role as the ultimate tennis party pooper. Despite the defeat for Nadal and his possible farewell, this definitely felt more celebration than wake. GO FURTHER Rafael Nadal Davis Cup analysis: Nadal loses to Botic van de Zandschulp of Netherlands Getty Images When van de Zandschulp hit two double faults in a row up 40-0 his first service game, it felt as though his nerves at playing his idol might undermine his chance of winning. When he hit two more at 3-4 in the first set, the first of which was a foot fault, that feeling strengthened. But the Dutchman escaped from the game, broke Nadal straight after and then served the set out pretty comfortably. Van de Zandschulp counterbalanced those four double faults in the first set with five aces, and aside from those extremely shaky moments, he served well, as the numbers above indicate. Then he did the hardest thing of all, serving out against Nadal in front of a crowd that wanted him to play forever. Getty Images Nadal’s inability to serve at a sufficient level is driving him away from tennis more than anything else. It was never the strongest part of his game — when he first burst onto the scene, it was probably the weakest — but he got so much better. Nadal’s average first serve on Tuesday floated around the 110mph mark. Against van de Zandschulp and just about everyone else he faced this year, that limitation sucked him into multi-shot rallies that his body just doesn’t can’t cope with anymore. Serves look like they are about arms and shoulders, but really they are about the spine and the abdominal muscles and the hips: areas of the body that could be a rundown of Nadal’s injury problems the past two years. Through the first set, Nadal landed 61 percent of his first serves and won 70 percent of those points. Despite four double faults in that set, van de Zandschulp was serving at 76 percent and winning 90 percent of those points. Those numbers are tough to overcome. GO FURTHER Rafael Nadal Davis Cup analysis: Nadal loses to Botic van de Zandschulp of Netherlands Getty Images It is very likely that Alcaraz will level this tie with his singles match against Griekspoor. And if he can then star again in the deciding doubles match, it will leave Spain captain David Ferrer with a tough decision to make. He will have to choose whether to use Nadal again in the semifinal, where Spain would be facing Germany or Canada. Based on today's evidence, Nadal will battle valiantly against anyone, but it is hard to see him beating any top-100 players.  In the end, the 4-6, 4-6 scoreline flattered the retiring 38-year-old a bit. Advertisement Getty Images This second match was always going to be an important one, but Alcaraz now needs two consecutive victories this evening to keep Spain in the Davis Cup. He is the overwhelming favourite to come through the singles match against Tallon Griekspoor and, if he does that, he is pencilled in for the deciding doubles match. Alcaraz is set to line up alongside Marcel Granollers for that match, and they are due to face Botic van de Zandschulp and the retiring 35-year-old Wesley Koolhof. Botic van de Zandschulp beat Rafael Nadal in the Davis Cup quarterfinals at the Palacio de Deportes José María Martín Carpena 6-4, 6-4 Tuesday. Van de Zandschulp prevailed over Nadal in a match ultimately decided by a battle of serves. The result leaves the Netherlands 1-0 up in the tie, with Carlos Alcaraz to face Tallon Griekspoor in the second singles rubber. If Alcaraz levels the tie with a victory, then it will come down to the doubles between Alcaraz and Marcelo Granollers and Griekspoor and Wesley Koolhof to decide things. Should Spain lose, Nadal’s tennis career will officially be over. And below, The Athletic’s writers, Charlie Eccleshare and Matt Futterman, analyze the match and what it means for Nadal. GO FURTHER Rafael Nadal Davis Cup analysis: Nadal loses to Botic van de Zandschulp of Netherlands  Speaking in the build-up to today's quarter-final against the Netherlands, Alcaraz discussed what this week means to him. ""It's probably the most special tournament I'll play in my career, because of what's happening, because of the circumstances,"" he said. ""The Davis Cup has always been a tournament that I'd love to win one day. I'm passionate about representing Spain. ""Having Rafa by my side, knowing it's his last tournament, will make it much more special."" In an interview with ATP, the 21-year-old added: ""Rafa's farewell is much more important, at least for me. The Davis Cup is every year. Rafa's farewell, saying goodbye to a legend of the sport, unfortunately only happens once. ""Personally I’m very excited to be by Rafa's side for his farewell."" Nadal's compatriot Carlos Alcaraz will look to keep Spain's hopes alive in the next singles match. The world No 3 will face Tallon Griekspoor who is 37 places below him in the rankings. Getty Images Botic van de Zandschulp, speaking to Tennis Channel post-match, said: ""In the beginning, we were both nervous. The first serves didn't go smoothly, the crowd was tough, of course. Understandable. ""That's what it is to play here in Spain against Rafa. It was a really special event. ""It's tough to close out a match against him, knowing it could be his last (match) or not. I was hoping a bit more than going for it, so I just went for it and that did help in the end. ""(The support) was unbelievable, I needed it. There were too many people here cheering for him! I needed them a lot today."" Advertisement Getty Images Rafa, ever the sportsman, shakes hands with Van de Zandschulp and the umpire, wipes his face, before walking back onto the court and raising his hands to the fans. The crowd, Spanish and Dutch alike, rise to their feet to applaud the legendary Nadal. A deserved standing ovation. Getty Images Rafael Nadal 4-6, 4-6 Botic van de Zandschulp And Botic van de Zandschulp holds on! Nadal nets and loses in the Davis Cup, 6-4, 6-4. The Netherlands 1-0 up on Spain in this tie. Rafael Nadal 4-6, *4-5 Botic van de Zandschulp Nadal must break here to avoid the Netherlands going 1-0 up on Spain in this Davis Cup tie. Ah, Rafa gets to the ball and is lined up to slap a forehand winner down the line, but misplaces it and instantly puts his hand to his head in disappointment. Again, he appears in control, but in centre court, drags one wide and can't believe it. 30-0. What a point! Nadal is suddenly possessed by the ghost of his former self and plays a blinding point, forcing Van de Zandschulp into positions where lesser men would have lost the point on multiple occasions. Brilliant, athletic defence from the Dutchman, who almost steals it but lands it narrowly wide. 30-all, the crowd very loud now. Even more so as Van de Zandschulp misses a first serve. The second is brilliant, and it's match point..."

Cooper Rush threw for 354 yards but the Cowboys' only touchdown came on a 64-yard KaVontae Turpin catch-and-run early in the second quarter.  The Texans recorded their first defensive touchdown of the season as Derek Barnett had a 28-yard scoop-and-score early in the fourth quarter that put the game out of reach.

""When we stay focused we can play with anyone in the league,"" Ryans said. The Texans coach also commended Joe Mixon's performance, calling him ""a force"" for the team. ""The run game starts with our offensive line,"" Ryans said. ""I challenged them to play fast, play aggressive. Thought they did a really nice job."" Advertisement In his postgame scrum, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones spoke candidly about the state of his team after yet another loss. ""We're just not playing well enough,"" Jones said.  Getty Images After the game, Dallas Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy said he wished he put quarterback Trey Lance in the contest at the end.  ""The one thing I should've did at the end and I didn't do is put Trey in there,"" McCarthy said. ""Could've gotten him a series."" Getty Images The Texans defense was mostly as advertised, limiting the Cowboys’ offense for much of the game. The Cowboys’ offense did put together a few decent drives they don’t have anything to show for, courtesy of a rare Brandon Aubrey miss from 40 yards and a failed red zone attempt on a fourth-and-2 incompletion, but Houston’s defense deserves a lot of credit, too. Even though Houston seemed hellbent on playing with its food, the defense finally rose up and slammed the door shut on the Cowboys in the fourth quarter when the Texans strip-sacked Rush and ultimately forced Tyler Guyton to fumble on the same play and returned it for a touchdown. Throughout the evening, the Texans had their fair share of dropped interceptions, none more glaring than a few plays prior to the Cowboys’ failed fourth-and-2 attempt in the third quarter. The fourth quarter was the best indicator of what the Texans’ defense can be when they’re actually playing their best, and that version of them didn’t let the Cowboys even get a false sense of confidence. Getty Images The Cowboys’ offense was much improved over their horrible showing last week against the Eagles, but they ultimately could not do enough to win the game. The much maligned defense had a horrid start to the game but tightened things up quickly after giving up two touchdowns to Mixon in the first quarter. Over the next two quarters, the defense only allowed two field goals to the Texans for a total of 20 points heading into the fourth quarter. Multiple times, the defense did its job and gave the ball to the offense with a chance to tie the game or close it down to a one-possession game. But the offense never responded. The offense couldn’t finish when the Cowboys needed it most on fourth-and-2 in the third quarter on the doorstep and then fell flat for the entire fourth quarter. Rush improved off his previous performance but had another fumbled snap from the shotgun and a handful of interceptable balls that could have made things look even worse. Getty Images Playing in his first game since Week 5 after recovering from a hamstring injury, star wide receiver Nico Collins made four receptions on seven targets for 54 yards tonight.  That doesn't tell the whole story though, as Collins would have had a 77-yard touchdown catch on the game's first play from scrimmage if it weren't for a ineligible man downfield penalty on Laremy Tunsil.  Advertisement According to Next Gen Stats, Danielle Hunter generated 10 pressures and two sacks on 46 pass rushes tonight, with nine of his pressures coming against right tackle Terence Steele. Hunter currently leads the NFL with 72 pressures, 15 more than the next closest player in Trey Hendrickson.  Getty Images Our discussion page is overflowing with schadenfreude...   Anonymous: America’s team. Feels about right. Brian A.: Houston scores again. The nation cheers. Edward D.: I almost feel sorry for Dallas fans and players, but never for Jerry Jones. Grant H.: Texans did what was needed, still major improvement needed but a win is all that matters. Hope Jerry Jones is having a lovely evening.

Dallas is projected to have a -8.0 expected points per game (16.5 points for, 24.5 points against). The Texans defense brought this one home and the offense finally getting its first second-half touchdown in nearly five games probably brings a sigh of relief. Joe Mixon was the star of the night for Houston with another 100-yard rushing performance and three TDs. Nico Collins showed enough in his return to help the Texans feel like they can return to being a more consistent offense.

You can point to rookie left tackle Tyler Guyton trying to run after recovering a fumble instead of just going to the ground. But it’s almost never been just one thing in the Cowboys’ losses this season. They’re just a bad team. They don’t put themselves in a position where a play here or a play there is the difference.  The result tonight is actually in the best interest for the franchise. There’s no reason to win any more games. This season is done. Get the best possible draft pick.  Getty Images C.J.

The Minnesota Vikings did it to them in Week 2, the Kansas City Chiefs edged them in Week 7, and the Seattle Seahawks outgained them 289 yards to 277 on Sunday. That output also was a season low for San Francisco, 33 fewer yards than it gained in the loss to the Chiefs. One drive in the second quarter was a microcosm of the game. The 49ers ran 11 plays and held the ball for seven minutes. But they also were docked 19 yards on penalties and gained just 26 yards before punting. The offense ran 63 plays versus 60 for the defense. Read here on how the individual snaps were divided. Quarterback: Brock Purdy 63 Purdy has had only two starts with fewer passing yards than the 159 he ended up with Sunday. He had 125 in a Week 6 loss to the Cleveland Browns last season. And he had 23 yards when he was injured early in the 2022 NFC Championship Game in Philadelphia. The storyline against the Seahawks’ bend-but-don’t-break defense was the lack of explosion on offense. Purdy didn’t attempt any passes beyond 20 yards and only six from 10 to 19 yards. The bulk of his pass attempts, 19 targets, were less than 10 yards. Coach Kyle Shanahan on Monday said Purdy emerged from the game with soreness in his right shoulder from a hit he took. Purdy ran five times for 40 yards against the Seahawks.

Meanwhile, Texans star wide receiver Nico Collins is expected back after missing the last five games with a hamstring injury. The 2021 third-round pick had a breakout year last season, catching 80 passes for 1,297 yards and eight touchdowns. His return will likely be a major issue for a banged-up Dallas secondary. Texans 35, Cowboys 17. Saad Yousuf, Cowboys beat writer: Last week, the Eagles didn’t really blow me away with the season they were having so I expected the Cowboys to be able to keep up but eventually fall short. I was sort of right, as the Cowboys kept it interesting for 30 minutes before the game turned into a blowout in the second half. I have similar feelings about the Texans. I believe they are a quality team, destined for the playoffs, but I don’t think they are elite. I think this will be a game in which Micah Parsons and DeMarvion Overshown will stand out in a big way. With that being said, the Cowboys are not even a quality team so I don’t think the end result will be unexpected. Texans 24, Cowboys 12. GO FURTHER  (Getty Images)             OWINGS MILLS, Md. — A day after Justin Tucker missed two field-goal attempts in a two-point loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ravens coach John Harbaugh expressed confidence in his kicker and dismissed the possibility of bringing in competition at the position. “There’s no thought to that,” Harbaugh said when asked if the team was considering auditioning free agent kickers to potentially replace Tucker. “The best option right now is to get Justin back on point, because he’s fully capable of doing it. I certainly haven’t lost any confidence in Justin Tucker. You saw that on the 54-yarder we sent him out for, and he drilled it. That’s the Justin Tucker that he wants to see and we all want to see on every kick."" Tucker missed 47 and 50-yard field goals attempts in the first half of the Ravens' 18-16 loss to the Steelers at Acrisure Stadium. The misses leave him 16-of-22 on field-goal attempts this season. He's also missed an extra-point try. His six misses through 11 games are already more than he's had in 10 of his 12 previous NFL seasons. Tucker said after Sunday's game that he hasn't lost his confidence, but his misses have hurt the Ravens in a few close losses. ""He’s going to make a lot of kicks. I really believe that,"" Harbaugh said. ""But it’s up to him and the guys he works with every day to make those balls go straight. Competition right now, at this time, no, that’s not something we want for Justin. We’ve just got to compete to get better and make those kicks.” Tucker, 34, is a seven-time Pro Bowl selection. Before Sunday's misses, he had been the most accurate kicker in NFL history. However, his 89.348 percent success rate now puts him behind Eddy Pineiro (89.381 percent). GO FURTHER Normally ‘automatic’ kickers like Justin Tucker, Younghoe Koo are struggling in 2024 ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — The Buffalo Bills planned to throw it. “But I’m kind of anxious,” receiver Amari Cooper said. “It’s fourth-and-2!” You can forgive Cooper. He’s still pretty new here. He hasn’t fully absorbed the Josh Allen Experience. Allen soon would vaporize any tension and leave nothing but euphoria in Highmark Stadium, chants of “M-V-P!” booming into the Sunday night sky. “Some guys are just made to play ball in the position that they play,” Cooper said later at his locker stall, “and he’s definitely one of those guys.” The Bills insisted all week and in the immediate afterglow of their 30-21 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs that Sunday merely was one of 17 games, no more important than, say, beating the Tennessee Titans a month ago. But the showdown absolutely meant more. The two-time defending Super Bowl champs were undefeated, and although the Bills are correct to downplay a regular-season result — win or lose — as relatively insignificant in the master design to win the franchise’s first Lombardi Trophy, games and moments such as these achieve gravitas. Allen established himself as the NFL’s no-doubt best player Sunday. On a day when the league’s three active MVPs looked pedestrian by their standards and a couple of new candidates also stumbled, Allen flourished against a formidable defense and delivered a signature play in a career stuffed with highlights. “He’s played close to 100 games, and it seems like he does it every game,” Bills tight end Dawson Knox said. (The number actually is 104 in the regular season, 114 counting playoffs.) “It still never gets old. “It’s weird. You get to the point where you kind of expect it.” Read more from Sunday here. GO FURTHER Josh Allen emerges as MVP favorite following signature play in win over Chiefs (Getty Images)             While Josh Allen will get much of the applause for the game, and rightfully so, the defense deserves a heaping amount of praise for their efforts. Above all else, for the first time since Mahomes became the Chiefs’ full-time starting quarterback, the Bills shut down his favorite target like they never have before. Tight end Travis Kelce, who has long been a Bills antagonist for how well he’s played in these matchups, was held shockingly silent. Kelce caught only two passes for eight yards. In the seven games Mahomes and Kelce have been paired up against the Bills, Kelce has not had a game in which he gained fewer than 57 yards. His totals over those seven games, 51 receptions for 602 yards and eight touchdowns, would be among the most prolific tight end seasons in Bills history. That’s an average of seven catches for 86 yards. Over Kelce’s last three games this season, he’s caught 32 receptions for 254 yards. His average yardage per reception over those three games (7.93) was just a shade under how many total yards the Bills allowed to Kelce on Sunday. Over the years, the Bills have tried a little bit of everything. They’ve tried to bracket him in zone coverage. They’ve also tried to assign him a similarly sized defender on obvious passing downs to neutralize, but nothing worked. But the big question is, how, after all these years and matchups, did they finally slow Kelce down? It came down to heavy attention and switching things up from their usual operating procedure on defense. “Wherever he was at, that’s where we wanted to have our eyes at,” nickel corner Taron Johnson said after the game. “Even if it’s zone and stuff, we even play our zones a little different when he’s in the game because of how smart he is as a player.” Mahomes perpetually has his eyes looking for Kelce when he needs a play, and both players seem like they share a brain to find the soft spot in coverage. Kelce comes off the field more often than he has in previous seasons, which gave the Bills a chance to reset their scheme each time he was on the sidelines and resharpen once he trotted back into the game. But the Bills took him away like they never have before, which led to Mahomes looking elsewhere all game. “If we’re in zone, just heavy awareness where he is — kind of flood that area, type of deal,” said defensive back Cam Lewis, who subbed in on defense for every third down. It worked, and it helped take Kelce away early, forcing Mahomes to go elsewhere outside of a pair of dump-down throws. The Bills also went with an atypical approach once they had some good early-game results. “I feel we played a lot of man (coverage), to be honest with you, especially on third downs,” Lewis said. “I feel like we found it working kind of early that we could cover these guys, and our rush was humming tonight, so why not?” The Bills are a heavy zone team and have been so under head coach Sean McDermott for a long time. But with a pass rush getting to Mahomes and limiting his time to create, the Bills defense pounced by taking away Kelce and got themselves off the field more often than not. There were many reasons why the Bills won this big of a game, but limiting Kelce was chief among them. This is likely a much different game and, possibly, a different outcome if Kelce was able to get going.

Advertisement The Bills-Chiefs rivalry delivered yet again, with the Bills handing the Chiefs their first loss of the season.  The Ravens-Steelers rivalry delivered, too, and now the Steelers find themselves in command of the AFC North. Robert Mays and Derrik Klassen dig into those games, plus the Broncos statement win over the Falcons, the befuddling 49ers—as well as the broader picture of the NFC West—Anthony Richardson's triumphant return, and a whole lot more on this episode of The Athletic Football Show. Watch here. (Getty Images) Jaguars coach Doug Pederson just told reporters that WR Gabe Davis (knee) will miss the rest of the season. (Getty Images)             In your mind, does the Chiefs’ loss in Buffalo (paired, perhaps, with the Ravens’ loss in Pittsburgh) change the way you view the AFC hierarchy? Our writers discuss. Mike Jones: Things are deliciously intriguing at the top of the AFC. The Chiefs beat the Ravens to start the season, the Ravens thumped the Bills in Week 4, and now the Bills deliver a convincing win over the previously undefeated Chiefs on the same day that the Ravens lose to the Steelers (who will play Kansas City in Week 17 but will not face Buffalo this regular season). What does it tell us? Any of these top teams are capable of beating the other, and this race for the top seed and home-field advantage could come down to the wire. I still have the Chiefs as the top team in the conference — I will not bet against Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid in the postseason. From there, I’ll still go Baltimore as No. 2 despite the tough divisional loss to Pittsburgh — a game it should have won. From there, Buffalo No. 3, edging the Steelers out by a nose. Ted Nguyen: Not really. The Bills won a competitive game at home. The Steelers won a close game in which Justin Tucker missed two field goals. We have to remember there is a certain amount of luck in every game, no matter how good teams are. I’ll get concerned if the Chiefs and Ravens drop another game next week, but losing in competitive games against very good opponents shouldn’t drastically change how we view teams. The Bills do get a bump up in my book, but until they can beat the Chiefs in the playoffs, I still think the Chiefs are the best team in the AFC. The Bills won similar games against the Chiefs in the regular season in 2022 and ’23, and the Chiefs went on to win the Super Bowl. Dan Pompei: The Bills have won six straight, which makes them the hottest team in the AFC, if not the best. Week by week, they have continued to build their case. The Steelers have the second-longest win streak in the AFC with five straight victories, which means they should be in the conversation about the best team in the AFC North. But the Chiefs, despite their loss, still deserve as much respect as any team. Just because they aren’t the 1972 Dolphins doesn’t mean they won’t be in the Super Bowl — or win the Super Bowl again. And as much as any of the contenders, the Chiefs have the potential to get better as the season goes on, as they are expected to have some important players return from injuries. GO FURTHER  Sunday in the NFL was all about AFC contenders bullying each other for position in the conference as the season’s stretch run awaits. The Buffalo Bills showed calm and efficiency while handing Kansas City its first defeat after nine consecutive Chiefs victories to open the season. The Pittsburgh Steelers proved they still have the formula for containing MVP favorite Lamar Jackson. Their 18-16 victory over Jackson’s Baltimore Ravens, enabled partly by two more angst-inducing Justin Tucker missed field goals, lifted the Steelers to 8-2 and third in the AFC. Finally, the Los Angeles Chargers blew a 21-point lead, then survived to beat the Cincinnati Bengals, marking them as a team in transition away from its disappointing past, willed into relevance by new coach Jim Harbaugh.

The full Pick Six menu: GO FURTHER Reassessing AFC contenders: Bills the best? How dangerous are the Steelers? Sando’s Pick Six   Advertisement DENVER — Atlanta Falcons linebacker Kaden Elliss said Sunday evening that he was “pissed off.” Coach Raheem Morris didn’t say it exactly, but it wasn’t hard to figure out. “The whole game was about physicality and effort,” Morris said. “They out-physicaled us. They out-efforted us. Got our butts kicked today.” It was a bitter but accurate summary of the Denver Broncos’ 38-6 win Sunday afternoon at Empower Field at Mile High. The 32-point margin of defeat was Atlanta’s third-worst since 2010. “Pissed off, but we’ll let that fuel us,” Elliss said. “We’ll make that pissed off for greatness. Props to them. We just have to bounce back and stay pissed off.” If the Falcons (6-5) sense that feeling slipping away, they can always rewatch Sunday’s game. Three weeks ago, their biggest worry seemed to be that their defense would prevent them from being a significant threat in the playoffs. Suddenly, the concern is that defense might be a big enough problem to keep the team out of the playoffs entirely. Read more from Sunday. GO FURTHER Falcons’ very bad day in Denver puts their playoff prospects in question (Getty Images)             Daniel Jones took off with nothing but open field in front of him during a 2020 game against the Philadelphia Eagles. The deceptive speed that has made the New York Giants quarterback an effective runner allowed him to increase the distance from pursuing defenders. Then, as Jones neared the goal line for an 88-yard touchdown, he inexplicably stumbled. With a national audience watching on Thursday Night Football, Jones started to lose his footing at Philadelphia’s 30-yard line. He tumbled to the ground and was tackled by an Eagles defender at the 8-yard line, to the disbelief of everyone watching. With Jones’ benching signaling the end of his six-year run as the Giants’ starting quarterback, that play perfectly encapsulated his tenure. A flicker of promise but, ultimately, a disappointing result. The unofficial end of Jones’ reign came Monday when a source confirmed an NFL Network report that Jones is being benched. This move was inevitable after the Giants’ embarrassing 20-17 overtime loss to the Panthers in Germany in Week 10. Jones’ poor play was a major reason the Giants couldn’t score against the NFL’s worst defense. With the 2-8 Giants on their bye week, this was the logical time for a quarterback change to give backup Tommy DeVito — who was chosen over No. 2 QB Drew Lock — time to prepare to take over. The Giants went 3-13 in games started by Jones over the past two seasons, and they rank last in the league in scoring this season. His career record is 24-44-1. Read more here.

Dobbins’ 29-yard rushing touchdown with 18 seconds left.  Justin Herbert dominated the first half and finished the game with 297 passing yards, two touchdown throws and 65 rushing yards. Rookie wide receiver Ladd McConkey pulled in six catches for 123 yards.  Joe Burrow had another massive performance as Cincinnati mounted its comeback, throwing for 356 yards and three touchdowns. Ja'Marr Chase caught two TDs while Tee Higgins recorded 148 receiving yards and a TD.  Crucially for the Bengals, however, Evan McPherson missed two potential go-ahead field goals with the score tied in the final eight minutes.

Dobbins’ late touchdown propels Chargers past Bengals on ‘Sunday Night Football:’ Key takeaways Getty Images Speaking after the loss, Tee Higgins shows his frustration: “Finish. That's the word of the week. Finish the f-----g game.” I’d say word of the season is more precise. Advertisement Getty Images Just when it looked like the Chargers had completely collapsed, the combination of Justin Herbert and Ladd McConkey saved the day.  The rookie wide receiver out of Georgia finished with six catches on nine targets for 123 yards, including two 20+ yard catches on Los Angeles' game-winning touchdown drive.  McConkey's impressive rookie campaign rolls on. He now has 43 catches for 615 yards and four touchdowns.  Getty Images Ja'Marr Chase entered Sunday Night Football as the leading point scorer among wide receivers in fantasy football and he only widened that gap against the Chargers.  He reeled in seven of his 13 targets for 75 yards and two touchdowns but it could have been an even bigger night. On the Bengals' final drive, Burrow narrowly overthrew him for what could have been a long, walk-in touchdown.  On the season, Chase now has 66 receptions, 981 receiving yards, and 12 touchdowns. Getty Images According to Next Gen Stats, Justin Herbert and Joe Burrow both threw two deep touchdown passes tonight (passes of 20-plus air yards), marking the first time opposing quarterbacks have each thrown multiple deep TD passes in a game this season, and only the fifth time since 2016.  This season is beating down Joe Burrow. Every one of these news conferences looks harder to stomach than the previous. Getty Images Speaking after the Bengals' loss, Joe Burrow says two misses of his are bothering him, specifically failing to connect with Ja'Marr Chase on the go and on the slant late.  Throws he says he normally makes. “Got to make those plays,"" he said.  Advertisement Getty Images A year of redemption continues for Chargers running back J.K. Dobbins. In tonight's victory, he rushed for 56 yards and two touchdowns, including the 29-yard game winner. This season Dobbins has 670 rushing yards and six touchdowns after missing a majority of the last two seasons with serious, season-ending injuries. Getty Images Eli C.: What in the world has happened McPherson?!? Zach R.: This game is a perfect encapsulation of these two franchises. Allergic to success.  Tom G.: The Bengals are so creative at finding ways to lose.  Mike B.: Wow…what happened to the Bengals? It seemed with Burrow and Chase they were going to be among regular Super Bowl contenders with the Chiefs. Now they don’t even look like a playoff team. Has Zac Taylor lost the team? Is it the front office that failed to build the roster?  Getty Images With the victory, the Chargers remain in the top Wild Card spot and the No. 5 seed in the AFC.  The Bengals are now two games out of the final Wild Card position in the AFC, falling behind the Colts and the Dolphins. The Athletic All of a sudden, the AFC West is somewhat competitive. With the Chargers' thrilling victory and the Chiefs' loss on the road in Buffalo, Los Angeles is now just two games back of Kansas City. The Broncos crushed the Falcons at home and the Raiders fell to the Dolphins in Miami. Getty Images Returning from a quad injury, Tee Higgins paid immediate dividends for Cincinnati. He was tied with Ja'Marr Chase for a team-high 13 targets, reeling in nine catches for 148 yards and a 42-yard touchdown catch.  In fact, Higgins almost made a huge catch on the Bengals' Hail Mary attempt in the final seconds. Advertisement Getty Images Burrow took so many shots in the second half and still carried them back. Those missed kicks … Getty Images It was an interesting game for Justin Herbert. He got off to a hot start and then was frigid for most of the second half until a pair of connections with McConkey on the Chargers' game-winning drive.  He finished the evening accumulating 297 yards and two touchdowns, one to Will Dissly and another to Quentin Johnston. Los Angeles improves to 7-3. Getty Images Evan McPherson missed two field goal attempts inside the final eight minute of the game. Either one would have put the Bengals ahead 30-27 and may have provided them an opportunity to run the clock out.

The ball hits his hands but he is blown up by Derwin James, who might have saved a touchdown. Crazy ending to a crazier game.  Getty Images J.K. Dobbins hasn’t been very busy tonight relatively speaking, with only 12 scrimmage plays. The good news for fantasy managers who started him is that two of those plays found the end zone. That gives Dobbins 18.9 PPR points tonight and six games with 16+ PPR points on the season. Getty Images Q4 00:18 Bengals 27, Chargers 34 J.K. Dobbins takes the handoff and breaks free down the sideline, leaping into the end zone for a go-ahead touchdown from 29 yards out.

MLB News,"Dig into Santander's top suitors, contract projections & more",https://www.mlb.com/news/anthony-santander-contract-projections-predictions-during-free-agency,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 03:00:00 GMT",,"Mark Feinsand With the 2024 season behind us and the hot stove ready to burn, we're taking a closer look at some of the most prominent players eligible for free agency. Name: Anthony SantanderPosition: Right fielderTeam: Baltimore OriolesAge (as of Opening Day 2025): 302024 stats: .235/.308/.506, 44 HR, 102 RBIs, 91 R, 134 OPS+, 3.3 fWAR Eight years ago, the Orioles rolled the dice by taking Anthony Santander with the final selection in the Major League portion of the Rule 5 Draft. That gamble certainly paid off. It took a while for Santander to establish himself as a productive big-league hitter, flashing big power as a 24-year-old in 2019 with a 20-homer season in 93 games. His big breakout season came in 2022, when he belted 33 home runs in 152 games, starting a three-year run that saw him hit 105 homers while playing in more than 150 games per season. The 2024 season was his best; he finished third in the Majors with 44 home runs, driving in more than 100 runs for the first time in his career. It was fortuitous timing for the 30-year-old, who made his first All-Star team just months before hitting free agency, where he should cash in with a hefty contract this winter. Will the Orioles look to keep the slugger in Baltimore, or will there be other suitors eager to add his powerful bat to their lineups? Let’s take a look at how Santander’s offseason might play out. BLUE JAYS George Springer’s presence in right field could be a roadblock to a Santander signing, though the pair could form a right field/DH combo to make it work. Santander has also started 75 games in left field during his career – half of them as recently as 2022 – opening another possibility. Either way, the Blue Jays are in the market for a bat, making Santander a potential fit. DODGERS Los Angeles is among the teams pursuing Juan Soto, but Teoscar Hernández would appear to be the team’s Plan B. Should Hernández sign elsewhere, however, Santander would be an ideal candidate to slot into right field. METS The Mets’ pursuit of Soto will determine much of what else they do this winter, but adding an outfield bat would seem to be in the cards one way or another. Santander would be an upgrade over Starling Marte, while his signing would give the Mets protection in the event that Pete Alonso signs elsewhere. NATIONALS Washington will look for a bat to upgrade its offense this winter, and while the outfield appears to be crowded with James Wood, Jacob Young and Dylan Crews, Santander could slot in as the designated hitter while occasionally getting a turn in the outfield. Santander has also seen limited action at first base – he started seven games there for Baltimore in 2023 – so the Nats could think outside the box by moving him there. ORIOLES Baltimore’s deep core of young position players might mean the end of Santander’s time with the Orioles, but given the competitive nature of the AL East, his power bat might be difficult to replace. The Orioles figure to spend most of their free-agent dollars on pitching, but a return to Baltimore can’t be ruled out for Santander. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. PHILLIES Nick Castellanos’ name has surfaced on the trade market, which would potentially open the door for the Phillies to pursue Santander. Even if Castellanos isn’t moved, the addition of Santander would make sense, allowing Brandon Marsh to move to center field on a full-time basis or to platoon with Johan Rojas. TIGERS Detroit was one of the best stories of 2024, making a late-season run to the postseason. But the offense ranked ninth in the league in runs scored and 12th in home runs and OPS, so adding a bat would seem to be a priority this offseason. Right field featured a rotating cast of characters including Wenceel Pérez, Kerry Carpenter and Matt Vierling, but a power bat like Santander’s would add some much-needed thump to the lineup. YANKEES As is the case with nearly every other key free agent this winter, the Yankees’ interest could depend upon whether they are able to re-sign Soto. If Soto departs for another club, the Yankees will have a sizable hole in their lineup and outfield, one they could fill with the signing of Santander. The switch-hitting slugger gave the Yankees a close-up look at what he could do in the Bronx, where he posted a .936 OPS with three home runs in six games in 2024. “There’s no question that Santander is coming off the best season of his career at the most opportune time, winning his first Silver Slugger thanks to a monster power output. However, he achieved this peak at a later age than some of those current class comps, which may give teams the idea that they could get something of a discount. While the Orioles extended him the qualifying offer, I think it is much more possible that he signs a long-term deal outside of Baltimore. With 44 home runs, 102 RBIs and a 119 wRC+, Santander can land a long-term contract with an AAV of roughly $20 million. Given the Orioles' surplus in young offensive talent, it would be surprising if they signed Santander, but there should be several teams that would be willing to sign him to such a deal.” Santander’s expected home run total was 36.6, meaning that some of his 44 home runs were the result of being in the right place at the right time, hitting the ball to the right part of the ballpark. Based on some of his underlying stats (exit velocity, hard hit rate and walk rate), Santander’s 2024 actually wasn’t too much of a spike year offensively, but he’s been been below-average in OAA in five of the past six seasons, leading some to wonder whether he’s a DH in the making. Santander is looking at a potential nine-figure deal over five years, landing somewhere in the range of the five-year, $90 million contract Masataka Yoshida signed two years ago and the six-year, $125 million deal Springer signed prior to the 2021 season. The best comp might be Castellanos, who inked a five-year, $100 million deal with the Phillies before the 2022 season."
MLB News,These 4 teams are showing the most interest in Crochet,https://www.mlb.com/news/garrett-crochet-rumors,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:06:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and trade rumors surrounding Garrett Crochet. Nov. 22: These teams seem most interested in CrochetWith Crochet headlining the list of potential trade candidates this offseason, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman says four clubs -- the Orioles, Red Sox, Dodgers and Phillies -- are showing the most interest in acquiring the White Sox left-hander. Heyman wrote for the New York Post that the O's and Red Sox are in prime position to strike a deal based on the position-player talent that Chicago is likely seeking in return. Of course, there's still plenty of time for another team to enter the mix, with Heyman noting that others have also expressed interest. Nov. 13: These clubs could be involved in trade market for CrochetAlthough the White Sox didn't move Crochet prior to the Trade Deadline, there appears to be little doubt about their intentions for the left-hander this offseason. ""They're going to trade him this winter,"" a rival evaluator told ESPN's Buster Olney at the GM Meetings last week. ""It's not a matter of if; it's a question of when."" Olney shed some light on Crochet's potential market in an article for ESPN+ (subscription required) on Wednesday, noting that general manager Chris Getz is looking for ""a package of prospects constructed around at least one high-ceiling youngster to anchor the deal."" Chicago's preference is for that main piece to be a position player, but the team is open to a pitcher being the centerpiece, ""depending on the depth and quality of the prospects offered."" Based on conversations with industry sources, Olney names the Phillies, Padres, Yankees, Dodgers, Braves, Orioles, Red Sox and Mets as teams that could pursue a Crochet trade. Nov. 9: Mets showing interest in trading for Crochet (report)According to a report in the New York Post, the Mets are ""discussing"" Crochet, who is one of the most likely players to be traded this offseason. It would stand to reason given that three of New York's starters from 2024 -- Sean Manaea, Jose Quintana and Luis Severino -- are free agents. Though the Mets are certainly in position to spend big this offseason, Crochet would be considerably cheaper in his remaining arbitration years than spending toward the top of the free agent pitching market. Nov. 7: Crochet garnering trade interest from many clubs, but one stands outThe White Sox held on to Crochet through the 2024 Trade Deadline when they were receiving calls from many teams interested in acquiring the fireballing left-hander. Now, an even greater number of clubs are trying to maneuver a deal for Crochet, general manager Chris Getz said during this week's General Managers Meetings. Crochet entered this season with only 73 big league innings under his belt over parts of three seasons and a lengthy injury history. But from Opening Day on, he proved he could be an ace. Crochet received his first Major League start in that season opener and proceeded to strike out eight batters and allow one run over six innings. He eventually became a first-time All-Star and ended the season with 209 strikeouts in 146 innings. Given that big jump in innings, Crochet's workload was capped over the final few months of the season. He made it through the year without a stint on the injured list. What do the White Sox want in return for Crochet, who has two years of club control remaining? Getz has made it pretty clear. ""We need to improve our offense, it’s very clear,” he told reporters Tuesday. “With any trade or free agency, we are looking for ways to improve our offense."" One team that could be a match for Chicago in a Crochet trade is the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox have six position players on MLB Pipeline's Top 100 Prospects list, including three in the top 10. They also have a few attractive pieces already at the big league level who are not yet eligible for arbitration. That group includes first baseman Triston Casas, catcher Connor Wong and Gold Glove outfielder Wilyer Abreu. With so much high-quality position-player depth, ""there’s a widespread sense that the Sox can trade for nearly anyone,"" according to The Boston Globe's Alex Speier (subscription required). MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Thursday from the GM Meetings that the Red Sox are ""the team I think a lot of people around here are looking at very carefully"" regarding a Crochet trade."
MLB News,Don't take the Judge & Ohtani Show for granted,https://www.mlb.com/news/mvps-shohei-ohtani-aaron-judge-appreciation,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 16:45:00 GMT",,"Will Leitch Surprising absolutely no one, Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge won the National League and American League MVP Awards, respectively, on Thursday night. The announcements capped two of the greatest seasons in recent baseball memory. Ohtani put up a 54 HR-59 SB season, and Judge … well, Judge may have been an even better hitter than that in 2024. There wasn’t much debate here, evidenced by a unanimous vote for both of them. It would seem that both Ohtani and Judge have secured their places in baseball history. After all, they’re the two most famous baseball players in the world right now -- you might have caught them at the World Series, don’t forget about that. This isn’t even their first go-around as MVPs: This is Ohtani’s third trophy (second in a row, and in two different leagues), and Judge’s second. And it’s not like they’re going away anytime soon, either. Ohtani is signed with the Dodgers through the 2033 season, and Judge will be in the Bronx at least through 2031. We’ll be watching them, in their current uniforms, for a while. But history has a way of playing tricks on us, and our perceptions of it. For undeniable reasons specific to each player, it seems clear, when their careers are over, that their collective counting stats – the big, round numbers that we use to identify Hall of Famers – will be smaller than we might have expected. Thus, when future generations spend the decades after they retire looking back at them on Baseball-Reference and MLB.com, they might not realize just how great these players were … because those final totals won’t necessarily pop. This isn’t a reason to downgrade their careers, of course, no matter what happens moving forward. It’s a reason to appreciate them right now -- a chance to reflect on just how good their peaks really have been, and how lucky we are to get to watch them as they reach that point. First off, Ohtani. Obviously, he is a special case. He is not only a unique player in the Majors, serving as a starting pitcher and a lineup linchpin, but his achievements are very much appreciable in the moment: He is literally the only player to have done what he is doing, at this level. But much of Ohtani’s appeal is wrapped up in that inherent risk, that tension between the miracle of what he’s doing and the fear that he won’t be able to do it forever. We have proof of that, of course: He didn’t pitch at all in 2024. It didn’t stop him from winning the MVP anyway. But is it reasonable to expect Ohtani to continue pitching for the rest of his contract with the Dodgers? Through 2033? Probably not, right? And even if he does pitch for the next half-decade or so, it’s unlikely he’ll put up enough innings for his mound numbers to ever truly blow anyone away. For all his success so far -- before a second Tommy John surgery, it must be reminded -- he has thrown only 481 2/3 innings in MLB. For perspective, that’s fewer than such luminaries as Andrew Chafin, Griffin Canning, Dakota Hudson and T.J. McFarland. He’ll throw more, but he’s not even halfway to even, like, José Ureña and Marco Gonzales. Which means it’s going to be his hitting that makes the numbers add up. There are inherent limitations there, too. Ohtani is 30 years old, turning 31 in July, and he “only” has 225 homers for his career. That’s eighth among active players to that point in their careers, just seven more than Anthony Rizzo and 10 more than Francisco Lindor. And most players don’t keep up the same pace in their 30s. While Ohtani hasn’t actually missed a lot of time at the plate to injury in recent years – he’s 15th in MLB in games played since 2021 – his two-way exploits likely do raise the risk of injuries that actually could harm his availability with the bat. That might make a milestone like 500 homers a lot more difficult to reach than it would seem right now. Judge may have even more issues, considering he’s two years older than Ohtani with a spottier health record, not to mention the challenge of being 6-foot-7 and 282 pounds. Judge didn’t even reach the Majors until he was 24 years old and won Rookie of the Year at age 25. (Here is your reminder that Juan Soto just turned 26.) That late start has always made it difficult for Judge to reach the counting stats you’d think a guy who has hit at least 58 homers twice would be able to reach. (The truncated 2020 season hurts him, and Ohtani, and everyone from this era, here as well.) Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. This means Judge has “only” 315 homers and 1,026 hits; remember how shocked everybody was when he reached the 1,000-hit mark last year? Now, obviously, Judge can pick up those homers fast, including 157 of them over the past three seasons. But those came during his early 30s, and there is much historical worry to be had over how players his size age. Are we certain he’s going to make it to 500 homers? My colleague Andrew Simon tried to figure this out in August, and one estimate, via Bill James’ Favorite Toy tool, gave Judge an 82 percent chance of reaching 500, and 37 percent chance of reaching 600. Both of those figures, frankly, strike me as a little  bit high. Either way: Judge’s number is probably going to end up lower than most people think based on his name, and reputation. If I’ve learned anything over my years of writing about baseball, it’s that the further you get away from a player’s actual career, and what you watched during it, the more you rely on that stat sheet. This isn’t a bad thing: It’s why people finally came around to appreciating Bert Blyleven and Tim Raines well after their careers ended, in a way they didn’t when those guys were playing. But it also can make it so that you forget, in the haze of statistics, just how overwhelming and dominating a player was at his peak. (It’s why everybody who watched Dale Murphy felt like they were watching a Hall of Famer when they saw him, though his career numbers didn’t end up that impressive.) Right now, it seems obvious that the best players of this era are Ohtani and Judge. But I wonder if that will be as obvious in 20 years, when all is said and done … and those career numbers fall behind those of guys like Soto, Bryce Harper, Manny Machado or whomever. That’s especially true for those who won’t remember watching Ohtani and Judge at their best. This is not to say that these are not future Hall of Famers: Ohtani and Judge clearly are. But the only way to truly appreciate how transcendent they are right now is to watch them right now. Because ultimately, the career stats won’t do as much as they should to remind us. These are otherworldly baseball players, at their peak, right now. We’re lucky to get to see it. We may be the only ones who, in the end, truly understand it."
MLB News,"Unanimous MVPs Judge, Ohtani made it a no-doubter with historic seasons",https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-mvp-award-winners-2024,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:38:00 GMT",,"Anthony Castrovince They weren’t just the two best seasons of their time but two of the absolute best seasons of all-time. Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge left absolutely no doubt as to how the Baseball Writers’ Association of America MVP honors would turn out, so all that was left Thursday night on MLB Network was to make it official. And unanimous. Ohtani, the two-way wonder who was relegated by elbow surgery to designated hitter duties in his first season with the World Series champion Dodgers, claimed his third MVP and his first in the NL with a 50-homer, 50-steal season that was truly one of a kind. He joined Hall of Famer Frank Robinson as the only players to win MVP in both leagues. “I’m just representing the Dodgers,” Ohtani said through interpreter Matt Hidaka. “It was a complete team effort. I wouldn’t have been able to receive this award if it weren’t for my teammates. If we didn’t play as a team, we would not have gotten to the playoffs or won the World Series. So I take this as representing a team, receiving this award.” And Judge, the mammoth Yankee captain, fell just shy of his AL single-season home run record but nevertheless had one of the greatest offensive performances ever by a right-handed hitter, en route to his second AL MVP in the last three years. “I was talking to [two-time MVP Bryce] Harper a lot this season and telling him, ‘Man, I’m going to try to catch up to you in these MVPs here,’” Judge joked. “It means a lot [to win another]. Just a lot of hard work in the offseason, during the season, the ups and downs throughout it. Just the constant support from my teammates, the fans in New York, just everybody to help me get to this spot.” Both players received first-place votes on all 30 ballots submitted in their respective leagues, marking the second straight year both MVPs were unanimous after it had never happened prior to 2023. Royals shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. finished second in the AL, with Judge’s Yankees teammate (and now free agent) Juan Soto in third. Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor was second in the NL, with Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte in third. The performances of these two likely future Hall of Famers in the regular season were overwhelming. Yes, Lindor took on the leadoff spot and put the Mets on his back, bound for October, by rattling off 33 homers and 29 steals to go with his dynamic defense at short. And yes, Witt was the most well-rounded player in MLB this year, also playing dazzling defense at the premier position while becoming the first player in history with at least 30 homers, 40 doubles, 10 triples and 25 steals in a season. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. But those elite players with elite outcomes had to settle for second because of what Ohtani and Judge accomplished. Unable to pitch for 2024, Ohtani committed to intense speed-training exercises, upped his aggression and wound up swiping 59 bags in 63 attempts. That he did so while banging out 54 homers, 38 doubles and seven triples – notching only 98 singles among his 197 hits – made the feat all the more astounding. “I didn’t have specific number goals,” said Ohtani, “but I did want to improve my stolen base numbers.” It’s not just that Ohtani became the first player in history to post a 50-50 season. And it’s not just that he reached that threshold with one of the most otherworldly individual games the sport had ever seen (a 6-for-6, 10-RBI, three-homer, two-double, two-steal rampage in Miami on Sept. 19). It’s that, prior to this Ohtani outcome, no one had ever reached 50 homers in a season while also stealing more than 24 bags. And Ohtani became just the third player to finish in the top two in MLB in both homers and steals, joining Deadball Era icons Honus Wagner (1908) and Ty Cobb (1909). So now the 30-year-old Ohtani, who slashed .310/.390/.646, makes history of a different sort, becoming the first full-time DH to win the MVP. Of course, to label a man who can steal that many bags and who next season will resume a pitching career that so far has resulted in a 38-19 record, 3.01 ERA and 142 ERA+ merely a “hitter” is a misnomer to begin with. “I obviously don’t go into the season trying to strive to get the MVP Award,” said Ohtani, who this year was joined on the announcement show not just by his popular dog, Decoy, but also by his wife, Mamiko Tanaka. “I was focused on being one of the guys with a new team, the Dodgers, and I wanted to embrace the fans, as well, and let them know who I was.” Ohtani is the Dodgers’ 13th MVP and first since Cody Bellinger in 2019. He’s the sixth player to win an MVP with multiple franchises, joining Harper, Alex Rodriguez, Barry Bonds, Robinson and Jimmie Foxx, and just the second to win one in both leagues (Robinson). He’s also the first player since Miguel Cabrera (2012-13) to win an MVP in back-to-back years. Ohtani had already been the first player to win multiple unanimous MVPs (in 2021 and 2023 with the Angels). Now, he’s done it again. And yet, as amazing as Ohtani’s offensive performance was, Judge’s was superior in multiple key metrics. Judge hit an MLB-leading 58 homers, four shy of the AL record he had set in 2022. He drove in an MLB-best 144 runs, along with the leads in game-winning RBIs (24) and go-ahead RBIs (32). He drew an MLB-best 133 walks. He had an MLB-best .458 on-base percentage, .701 slugging percentage and 1.159 OPS. His fWAR (11.2) and bWAR (10.8) were both at the top of the list. But the best way to sum up the 32-year-old Judge’s season was his 223 OPS+. That’s a metric adjusted for the offensive environment in a given year, and this is a year in which power and average were down across the board. Per OPS+, Judge’s batting performance was 123% better than the league average – the highest by a right-handed hitter in the AL or NL in the modern era, which dates back to 1901. Judge was quick to cite batting behind Soto as a big reason for his season. “Seeing the pitches,” he said. “We all know this guy’s gonna be on base 50 percent of the time, if not more. But just, the quality of every single at-bat. It didn’t matter if he went up there and flew out or struck out. If you’re going to strike out Juan Soto, it’s going to take 10-12 pitches to get it by him. It’s impressive. I get to see how the pitcher’s feeling today, what pitches are working, is he going to the two-seamer now, is he trying to go to his wipeout slider now. So it just gave me a better picture of what to expect stepping into the box.” That the 6-foot-7, 282-pound Judge did this while patrolling center field for a Yankees team in need makes the offensive might all the more meaningful. “The team, we needed somebody to play center, and I felt it was best for the team,” Judge said. “So I said, ‘I’ll play center field, as long as you guys need me out there. I’ll play left, I’ll play right. Whatever gives us the best lineup.’ Especially when you go out and get a guy like Juan Soto, the most important thing is making sure he’s comfortable. And when he’s comfortable, you can see what he does and what he did this year.” Judge marks the 22nd Yankees MVP since the BBWAA began voting on the award in 1931, the most of any team. He’s only the second Yankee to win the award unanimously, joining Mickey Mantle (1956). Though their clash in the Fall Classic did not result in the individual performances people anticipated, Judge and Ohtani had done plenty to get their clubs to October in the first place. They both made history, and they both made it easy on the MVP voters."
MLB News,This 2-time All-Star could reunite with Hinch in Detroit (report),https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-rumors-trades-and-signings,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 02:27:00 GMT",LATEST FREE AGENT & TRADE RUMORS,"MLB.com We're keeping track of all the latest free agent and trade rumors. The Tigers are interested in free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman in an article for the New York Post. Heyman adds that the only club Bregman has played for in the Major Leagues, the Astros, have submitted a contract offer in an effort to re-sign the two-time All-Star, and that the Red Sox have ""inquired and could be a fit for Bregman if they move Rafael Devers to first."" If Bregman was to sign with Detroit, it would reunite him with his former manager in Houston, A.J. Hinch. Hinch was the manager when Bregman and the Astros won the franchise's first World Series title in 2017. The demand is high, but the supply is low. That's the story for teams looking to sign a frontline starting pitcher in free agency this offseason. The best arms available are Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried. You could add Japanese right-hander Roki Sasaki to that group, but he hasn't yet been posted for MLB teams, so he's not officially a free agent at the moment. As for those other three pitchers, at least seven teams have been connected to them in recent reports. Dodgers: The reigning World Series champions are one of the teams that have met with Snell already but are also talking to Burnes and Fried, according to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required). They ""like Snell a lot,"" per MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. The Dodgers are considered among the favorites for Sasaki, but Heyman reported last week in the New York Post that L.A. will try to sign one of the Big Three even if they land the Japanese phenom. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi sees the Dodgers as one of the two leading candidates for Burnes. Red Sox: Like the Dodgers, the Red Sox have met with Snell already but are keeping their options open with Burnes and Fried, Rosenthal reports. Orioles: With Burnes a free agent after spending 2024 with Baltimore, Orioles general manager Mike Elias said Friday that the team’s new ownership group has given him the flexibility to engage with the top starting pitchers on the free-agent market. Rosenthal hears the team is currently more focused on Snell and Fried, both of whom could have lower price tags than Burnes. Blue Jays: Rosenthal reports that Toronto is pursuing Burnes, Snell and Fried. Yankees: Heyman directly mentioned the Yankees' interest in Snell, but he added that New York's willingness to go after one of the top starters may be contingent on whether it can re-sign Juan Soto. Heyman said that if Soto doesn't come back to the Bronx, the Yankees ""will be more focused"" on these aces. But if Soto is back in pinstripes, Heyman thinks the Yankees won't spend the money necessary to get one of the top pitchers. Giants: Heyman said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if Snell returns to San Francisco after the left-hander enjoyed his time there during the 2024 season. Mets: Another club that's focused on Soto, the Mets will also be looking to upgrade a rotation that could lose Sean Manaea, José Quintana and Luis Severino in free agency. Although outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger exercised his player option for 2025, it’s not a guarantee that he’ll be with the Cubs on Opening Day. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), rival executives say that the Cubs want to trade the 29-year-old. More > Juan Soto's decision on where to sign this offseason is the most anticipated in baseball, and according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, ""the feeling around the industry"" is that the decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway in Dallas on Dec. 9. Soto reportedly has already met with the Blue Jays, Red Sox, Mets and incumbent Yankees. Yanks owner Hal Steinbrenner confirmed Wednesday that the club had a ""good meeting"" with Soto. Soto has a couple more meetings reportedly on tap. He is scheduled to meet with the Dodgers next. And according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman, the Phillies plan to meet with Soto at some point, though nothing has been scheduled yet. Per Heyman, it's believed that no offers have been made to Soto yet. You can follow the latest rumblings on Soto here. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Wednesday that Sasaki is expected to be part of the 2025 international amateur signing class, which means the Japanese right-hander likely won't sign with a club before Jan. 15. ""It looks like ... the signing will happen in the new pool period,"" Manfred said via The Athletic's Evan Drelich. More > While this year’s free-agent class has its share of attractive options with significant closing experience, including Tanner Scott, Kenley Jansen, Blake Treinen, Clay Holmes, Carlos Estévez, Kirby Yates and David Robertson, MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi expects the closer trade market to be active as well. Morosi has heard that the Brewers’ Devin Williams, the Cardinals’ Ryan Helsley and the Nationals’ Kyle Finnegan are available. Morosi even went as far as predicting that at least two of those closers will be traded before the end of the calendar year. Williams, Helsley and Finnegan all have one year of team control remaining and could be more cost effective than signing a closer in free agency. The latter two are perhaps more likely to be dealt, given the Cardinals and Nationals are both building for the future, but a Williams trade can’t be ruled out. Teams with serious postseason aspirations typically aren’t looking to trade away top stars from their Major League roster, but the Brewers have shown a willingness to be proactive in the past with players nearing free agency, trading Josh Hader in 2022 and Corbin Burnes last offseason. Williams could be next, though figuring out when to do it is a tough call for Milwaukee. A rival executive who spoke with MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand at the GM Meetings suggested that the Brewers would be better off waiting until the summer to put Williams on the trade block to maximize the return. However, it's possible they will look to deal Williams this offseason to avoid a repeat of the Willy Adames situation. Milwaukee didn’t trade Adames at the Deadline this past summer because it was leading the NL Central, and now the shortstop can depart as a free agent, leaving the club with nothing but a Draft pick in return. Thirteen players were tendered a qualifying offer (a one-year, $21.05 million deal for 2025) this offseason, but Reds right-hander Nick Martinez was the only one who accepted prior to Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline. The following 12 players rejected the qualifying offer and will remain free agents: Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Since the system was implemented in 2012, only 14 players to receive a QO have accepted it. You can read more about year's QO decisions here. Roki Sasaki isn't the only marquee Japanese pitcher who is expected to make the jump to the Majors this offseason. The 35-year-old Tomoyuki Sugano doesn't possess Sasaki's top-notch velocity, but as a two-time winner of the Sawamura Award -- the Japanese equivalent to the Cy Young Award -- Sugano should have his fair share of suitors. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has identified one team to watch for Sugano: the Angels. More > The Orioles could be one of the big players on the free-agent market for starting pitchers in their first offseason under their new ownership group. General manager Mike Elias said Friday that the Orioles have ""engaged"" in conversations with high-end starting pitchers in free agency. ""We are looking at the whole menu, the whole spectrum and I credit the ownership change toward putting us in a position to do that,"" Elias said. The highest of the high-end starters on the open market is Corbin Burnes, and the Orioles would welcome his return to Baltimore, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). The Orioles also have been linked to left-handed ace Max Fried. Additionally, Baltimore is among a host of clubs interested in acquiring White Sox southpaw Garrett Crochet via trade. However, given all of the young talent they have traded in the past year, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required) hears that the O's are more focused on the free-agent market right now. Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay said on his radio program on Monday that according to a source, Mets owner Steve Cohen is willing to beat any other club's offer to Juan Soto by $50 million. More > MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in an article for the New York Post that the Yankees met with superstar slugger Juan Soto in Southern California on Monday as they look to retain him after he helped lead them to the World Series. More > According to Ken Rosenthal and C. Trent Rosecrans of The Athletic (subscription required), the Royals and Reds are discussing a trade that would involve right-handed starter Brady Singer going to Cincinnati in return for infielder Jonathan India. However, sources told The Athletic that a trade involving Singer and India was not close on Saturday and is just one of several possibilities both teams are considering. Singer is reportedly drawing interest from other clubs while India is just one of the hitters the Royals are targeting. Singer and India were college teammates at the University of Florida and 2018 first-round MLB Draft picks by their current clubs. Singer is coming off a year in which he recorded a 3.71 ERA and 170 strikeouts over a career-high 179 2/3 innings. India, the 2021 National League Rookie of the Year, has been hampered by injuries during his career, but he had 15 homers and a .750 OPS in 151 games this past season. Both players are under club control through the 2026 season. The Red Sox have reportedly made their pitch -- or at least an initial one -- to Juan Soto. They are also trying to convince the top starting pitchers on the market to come to Fenway, too. ESPN's Jeff Passan said during Friday's edition of the Baseball Bar-B-Cast podcast that the Red Sox are talking to Blake Snell and Max Fried. More > Willy Adames is drawing “broad” interest across the Majors, according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. While Adames’ market includes teams that have an opening at shortstop, there are also a number of clubs eyeing him as a third baseman. More > With Max Fried and Charlie Morton both free agents, adding rotation help is a priority for the Braves this offseason. Nathan Eovaldi ranks near the top of Atlanta’s wish list (per a source), but he isn’t the only free-agent starter the team is said to be considering, as MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi hears the Braves also have interest in Walker Buehler. Returning from his second Tommy John surgery, Buehler struggled to the tune of a 5.38 ERA over 16 starts this past season. However, he finished the year on a high note, tossing 10 straight scoreless innings in the postseason and closing out the Dodgers’ title-clinching win over the Yankees in Game 5 of the World Series. Buehler, 30, was one of baseball’s top starters from 2018-21, recording a 2.82 ERA (146 ERA+) with 620 strikeouts and 137 walks in 564 innings. Atlanta could be an attractive landing spot for Buehler in more ways than one. The right-hander has ties to two nearby states, as he was born in Kentucky and attended Vanderbilt in Tennessee. Buehler also just watched the Braves have success with another reclamation project, Chris Sale. Atlanta acquired Sale from the Red Sox last offseason after several injury-plagued seasons. The lefty stayed healthy in 2024 and is the overwhelming favorite to win the National League Cy Young Award. In addition to their interest in Eovaldi and Buehler, the Braves have been linked to White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet on the trade market, though it's unclear if they have enough prospect capital to swing a trade. Fried is still a possibility, too, but paying top dollar for free agents is not part of president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos’ typical M.O. MLB Trade Rumors predicts Fried will sign a six-year, $156 million contract, compared to one year, $15 million for Buehler and two years, $44 million for Eovaldi. The Dodgers are viewed as one of the top contenders to sign Japanese right-hander Roki Sasaki once he is posted by his Nippon Professional Baseball team, the Chiba Lotte Marines. However, The Athletic's Jim Bowden (subscription required) doesn't see it that way. Based on his conversations with league sources, Bowden thinks it's ""unlikely"" Sasaki will sign with the Dodgers. And Bowden mentioned a few reasons why. More > Although the Yankees are going to make a strong effort to bring back Juan Soto, there’s a real chance the superstar outfielder signs elsewhere, which means New York needs to have a backup plan in place. That backup plan appears to have no limits. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Thursday in the New York Post that the Yankees are ""in on everyone."" One day earlier, during his live chat for Bleacher Report, Heyman was a little more specific on which non-Soto players the Yanks might target. More > The Phillies sign Alex Bregman. That is the prediction of one rival evaluator to ESPN's Buster Olney. The Phillies don't have an opening at third base right now, but they could create one by dealing Alec Bohm, who is on the trade block, per ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). Bohm and Bregman had similar offensive production this year (the former had a 117 OPS+ while the latter had a 118) and both were plus defenders according to outs above average. However, Bregman, a 2024 Gold Glover, has a much longer track record of stellar defense at the hot corner. His has 28 OAA for his career at the position while Bohm has minus-8. Bregman would also bring a large dose of World Series experience to a club that has been thwarted in the postseason in recent years and hasn't won it all since 2008. The Astros have made it clear that re-signing Bregman is their biggest priority of the offseason, but he isn't expected to make his decision any time soon. MLB.com's Mark Feinsand said during a Reddit AMA on Tuesday that he thinks Bregman's chances of remaining with Houston are 50/50. Although the White Sox didn't move Garrett Crochet prior to the Trade Deadline, there appears to be little doubt about their intentions for the left-hander this offseason. ""They're going to trade him this winter,"" a rival evaluator told ESPN's Buster Olney at the GM Meetings last week. ""It's not a matter of if; it's a question of when."" Olney shed some light on Crochet's potential market in an article for ESPN+ (subscription required) on Wednesday, noting that general manager Chris Getz is looking for ""a package of prospects constructed around at least one high-ceiling youngster to anchor the deal,"" with a preference for that main piece to be a position player. Based on conversations with industry sources, Olney names the Phillies, Padres, Yankees, Dodgers, Braves, Orioles, Red Sox and Mets as teams that could pursue a Crochet trade. You can follow the latest rumblings on Crochet here. ESPN's Jeff Passan breaks down the markets for the key free agents and trade targets in his 2024-25 offseason preview (subscription required). Here's what he's reporting on potential landing spots for some of the top hitters and pitchers available: FA hitters FA pitchers Trade market The players Passan cites as potentially being available on the trade market this winter include: Pitchers -- White Sox ace Garrett Crochet, Brewers closer Devin Williams, Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley, Cardinals right-hander Sonny Gray, Mariners right-hander Luis Castillo, D-backs left-hander Jordan Montgomery, Rockies reliever Justin Lawrence Position players -- Cubs second baseman Nico Hoerner and outfielder Cody Bellinger, Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm, Cardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado, Guardians first baseman Josh Naylor, Rays second baseman Brandon Lowe and first baseman Yandy Díaz, Giants first baseman LaMonte Wade Jr., Rockies second baseman Brendan Rodgers According to a report from USA Today’s Bob Nightengale, Christian Walker is a popular name on the free-agent market, with at least six teams planning to “aggressively pursue” the first baseman. Walker received a qualifying offer from the D-backs, but he will likely decline it. Nightengale names the Yankees, Mets and Nationals as teams that are expected to join Arizona in pursuit of Walker, who should come with a lower price tag than that of fellow free-agent first baseman Pete Alonso, given the age disparity between the two players. (Walker is four years older.) The Yankees and Mets are also two of the top contenders for Juan Soto, the No. 1 free agent on the market, but both clubs need to address first base as well. With his expected price tag, signing Walker likely wouldn't impact either team's pursuit of Soto, who is headed for one of the largest contracts in MLB history. Walker doesn’t have quite the same power as Alonso, but he’s no slouch with the bat, having recorded 95 homers and an .813 OPS over the past three seasons. In that same time, Alonso has produced 120 homers and an .826 OPS. Walker, meanwhile, is a far better defender, winning three straight Gold Gloves and leading his position with +38 Outs Above Average since the beginning of 2022. Alonso has produced -17 OAA in that span. In addition to the teams Nightengale mentioned, the Astros, Twins, Mariners, Cardinals and Padres could also be involved in the first-base market to some extent."
MLB News,10 players who might join free-agent pool soon,https://www.mlb.com/news/non-tender-candidates-2024-2025-mlb-free-agents,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 03:00:00 GMT",,"Thomas Harrigan Friday at 8 p.m. ET marks the deadline for teams to “tender” a contract for the 2025 season to players who are under club control. These are players on the 40-man roster who have not accrued enough service time to become eligible for free agency. If the club opts not to do so, it “non-tenders” the player, who becomes a free agent and then can sign with any of the 30 teams. Some notable players who were non-tendered after the 2023 deadline include Brandon Woodruff (Brewers), Jacob Stallings (Marlins), Tim Hill (Padres), Osvaldo Bido (Pirates) and Spencer Turnbull (Tigers). All moved on to join other teams except Woodruff, who re-signed with Milwaukee on a two-year deal in February while rehabbing from right shoulder surgery. With input from MLB.com executive reporter Mark Feinsand, here is a list of some of the more interesting non-tender candidates to watch ahead of Friday’s deadline. Griffin Canning, SP, BravesThe Braves acquired Canning from the Angels in the Jorge Soler trade on Oct. 31, but that swap was more about getting Soler’s contract off the books than anything else. After recording a 5.19 ERA with a 1.97 K/BB ratio over 171 2/3 innings in 2024, Canning is not a lock to be tendered a contract by the Braves in his final year of arbitration eligibility. Dylan Carlson, OF, RaysOnce a highly touted prospect with the Cardinals, Carlson finished third in the National League Rookie of the Year voting in 2021, but he hasn’t been able to replicate that success, slashing .225/.309/.341 (84 OPS+) over the past three years. Carlson’s time with St. Louis came to an end in '24 when he was traded to the Rays for veteran reliever Shawn Armstrong in July. He ended up with a career-low .563 OPS and -1.2 WAR (per Baseball-Reference) between the Cardinals and Rays. Dane Dunning, SP/RP, RangersAfter leading the Rangers in innings (172 2/3) and posting a 3.70 ERA in 2023, Dunning had a rocky '24 campaign. The 29-year-old made multiple trips to the injured list with a right shoulder issue, lost his rotation spot in June and was optioned to Triple-A in August. All told, he made 26 appearances (15 starts) on the year and had a 5.31 ERA. Trent Grisham, OF, YankeesGrisham played sparingly after being traded from the Padres to the Yankees in the Juan Soto blockbuster last December, amassing just 209 plate appearances in 2024. The 28-year-old is a superb defender with two Gold Glove Awards on his resume, but he has slashed .191/.298/.353 (84 OPS+) over the past three seasons. Austin Hays, OF, PhilliesIn need of more right-handed thump in their outfield this past summer, the Phillies swung a Trade Deadline deal with the Orioles for Hays, who hit 54 home runs across 2021-23. The move didn’t work out, however, as Hays recorded only two homers with a .672 OPS over 22 games in a Philadelphia uniform. That said, he still finished with an OPS+ over 100 (101) for the fourth straight year. Jordan Romano, RP, Blue JaysRomano had an excellent run as the Blue Jays’ closer from 2021-23, collecting 95 saves in that span while posting a 2.37 ERA with an 11.1 K/9. But the 2024 campaign was a different story for the 31-year-old, who recorded a 6.59 ERA over 15 appearances before undergoing season-ending arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow in July. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Patrick Sandoval, SP, AngelsSandoval was one of the Angels’ best starters in 2022, recording a 2.91 ERA with a 9.1 K/9 over 27 starts, but he struggled over the past two seasons (4.45 ERA, 4.4 BB/9) before undergoing Tommy John surgery with an internal brace in June. The lefty could miss most of 2025. Leody Taveras, OF, RangersTaveras established himself as the Rangers’ everyday center fielder in 2023, finishing the regular season with 2.6 bWAR and a 101 OPS+ and starting all 17 playoff games during the team's run to a World Series championship. He received regular playing time again in 2024 but produced just 0.5 WAR and an 84 OPS+, putting the 26-year-old’s future with the team in question. Ramón Urías, INF, OriolesUrías has been a useful player for the Orioles during his five-year career, winning a Gold Glove Award at third base in 2022 and hitting .262 with 39 homers, a .736 OPS and a 108 OPS+ over 429 games. However, the O's glut of infielders could make Urías and/or Jorge Mateo expendable, with Gunnar Henderson, Jordan Westburg, Ryan Mountcastle, Jackson Holliday and Coby Mayo all on the roster. Mike Tauchman, OF, CubsTauchman’s discerning eye has helped him reach base at a .360 clip for the Cubs over the past two seasons, but he doesn’t offer much beyond that. The Cubs also aren’t lacking in outfield options, with Cody Bellinger, Ian Happ, Seiya Suzuki and Pete Crow-Armstrong all in the mix for playing time."
MLB News,What Siri will bring to the Mets in 2025,https://www.mlb.com/news/jose-siri-brings-defense-speed-to-mets-outfield,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 16:37:51 GMT",,"Anthony DiComo This story was excerpted from Anthony DiComo’s Mets Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. NEW YORK -- In what’s been a relatively quiet start to the offseason across the Majors, the Mets completed one of the splashier moves to date in acquiring outfielder Jose Siri from the Rays for reliever Eric Orze. In today’s newsletter, I’ll break down why the Mets made this trade and what Siri brings to the team. What sort of player is Siri? He’s an outfielder with glaringly obvious strengths and weaknesses. In center field, Siri is a bona fide star defender. He rated in the 99th percentile of outfield range this season, largely because of his speed. Statcast rated him one of MLB’s 10 fastest players, with an average competitive sprint speed of 29.9 feet per second. (The fastest Met was Luisangel Acuña at 29.5.) Siri likewise possesses one of the game’s strongest arms, topping out at 101.2 mph from the outfield. That, also, was Top 10 in the Majors. “Siri, he can electrify everybody that watches him play,” Rays president of baseball operations Erik Neander said. “He can electrify the audience by completing plays that few, if any, can. But it is certainly a boom-or-bust type of profile.” The “bust” aspect only comes into play at the plate, where Siri also possesses big tools, but an approach that has frustrated his prior three organizations. Over the last two seasons, Siri has hit 43 homers, suggesting a solid power base. He’s also struck out 300 times. Siri’s 36.9 percent K rate is easily the highest among players with at least 600 plate appearances over that stretch. How does he fit with the Mets?  Essentially, Siri is the Mets’ Harrison Bader replacement. Entering his first year of arbitration, Siri comes significantly cheaper than Bader, who made $10.5 million. He’s also under team control for three more seasons, giving the Mets center-field stability at a time when they’ve shown a clear preference for keeping Brandon Nimmo in left. That’s unlikely to change for the rest of Nimmo’s career. If the Mets land Juan Soto in free agency, Siri’s playing time will suffer, since Tyrone Taylor would receive most of his reps in center. If not, Siri figures to start the bulk of games at that position, with Taylor playing more frequently in right. Starling Marte could spend quite a bit of time at DH depending upon how the rest of the roster shakes out. Since arriving in New York, president of baseball operations David Stearns has made team defense a focus. Siri clearly adds to that. Why would the Rays let Siri go? Neander would never say this out loud, but small-market teams like the Rays routinely trade players once their salaries start increasing, which is exactly what’s happening with Siri. MLB Trade Rumors projects him to make $2.3 million next season, or about triple what he earned this year. Rather than pay Siri that money, the Rays are going with the younger, cheaper Jonny DeLuca in center. Siri also carries something of a checkered reputation, taking criticism from his former manager Dusty Baker for admiring a homer with the Astros in 2022 and trading punches with Brewers pitcher Abner Uribe this year, among other infractions. But that wasn’t an obstacle for the Mets and their strong clubhouse culture; right now, they’re mostly interested in what Siri can do on the field.

MLB News,Here are the top 30 prospects from the 2024 Arizona Fall League,https://www.mlb.com/news/top-30-prospects-from-2024-arizona-fall-league,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 02:19:00 GMT",,"Jim Callis Though the quality of pitching in the Arizona Fall League continued to decline, the developmental circuit's best prospect did his work on the mound. Phillies right-hander Andrew Painter returned to competition after missing the entire 2023 and 2024 seasons and quickly re-established himself as the most promising young arm in the game. Painter was one of 15 Top 100 prospects to crack our AFL Top 30 prospects rankings below -- though just one of two pitchers. The Fall League featured a bumper crop of first basemen that included baseball's four best prospects at the position (Jac Caglianone, Bryce Eldridge, Nick Kurtz, Xavier Isaac) and its first Triple Crown winner ever (Josue Briceño). As usual, our evaluations are based more on long-term potential than AFL performance, though both are considered. We also solicited opinions from scouts who monitor the league. More on the Arizona Fall League:• Complete coverage | All-AFL Team | Award winners 1. Andrew Painter, RHP, Glendale (Phillies No. 2/MLB No. 32)Bouncing back from Tommy John surgery in July 2023, Painter won AFL Pitcher of the Year honors after working 15 2/3 innings and placing second in the league in WHIP (0.89) and third in ERA (2.30). He battled his fastball command at times but showed the ability to miss bats and get chases with all four of his pitches: a heater that averaged 97 mph and touched 100, an upper-80s slider/cutter, a low-80s curveball and a low-90s changeup. 2. Chase DeLauter, OF, Surprise (Guardians No. 2/MLB No. 41)DeLauter also ranked second on this list a year ago and continued to show an uncommon combination of size (6-foot-4, 235 pounds), athleticism, performance and plate discipline. After missing much of the Minor League season with foot and hamstring injuries, he slashed .340/.475/.511 while playing twice a week and spending the rest of his time working with the training staff at the Guardians' base in Goodyear. 3. Leodalis De Vries, SS, Peoria (Padres No. 2/MLB No. 28)The youngest player in the league, De Vries turned 18 after the season started and became the youngest Fall Leaguer to homer since Bryce Harper in 2010. His .179/.269/.313 line belies his possibility to develop at least solid tools across the board and his 30/30 upside, though he's not a slam-dunk shortstop. 4. Ethan Salas, C, Peoria (Padres No. 1/MLB No. 19)The circuit's only other 18-year-old, Salas is unusually athletic for a catcher and looks like a future Gold Glover with advanced receiving skills and plus arm strength. He batted .228/.327/.424 with four homers in 23 games and should develop into a solid hitter with average power once he gains more strength and experience 5. Jac Caglianone, 1B, Surprise (Royals No. 1/MLB No. 17)The No. 6 overall pick in the 2024 Draft, Caglianone looked tired after playing from February through November but still homered five times in 21 games. He might have more usable power than anyone in the Minors and moves very well for a 6-foot-5, 250-pounder, but his chase rate (37 percent in the Fall League continues to bear watching). Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. 6. Colt Emerson, SS, Peoria (Mariners No. 1/MLB No. 27)The best pure hitter and the third-youngest player in the Fall League, Emerson slashed .370/.435/.537 with a league-best nine doubles in just 13 games. He has a classic left-handed stroke, makes advanced swing decisions and should grow into 20-homer power, though he'll probably move off shortstop. 7. Bryce Eldridge, 1B, Scottsdale (Giants No. 1/MLB No. 35)After rocketing from Single-A to Triple-A in his first full professional season, Eldridge batted .293/.348/.512 with two homers in 10 games before departing shortly after his 20th birthday. Few players can match his massive raw power, and his mature approach enables him to get to most of it. His first-base defense is quite rough but he has the athleticism to improve. 8. Colson Montgomery, 3B, Glendale (White Sox No. 3/MLB No. 37)No. 1 on this list a year ago, Montgomery performed better in his second Fall League stint, hitting .313/.511/.656 with three homers in 11 games. The Corey Seager comparisons persist, and while his power is real, his hitting ability isn't in the same class and he's less likely to stick at shortstop for a decade. More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage 9. Nick Kurtz, 1B, Mesa (Athletics No. 2/MLB No. 45)Kurtz might have had the best combination of swing decisions, contact and exit velocities in the 2024 Draft, where he went No. 4 overall. He slashed .353/.450/.608 after joining Mesa for the second half and was the league's best defensive first baseman. 10. Zyhir Hope, OF, Glendale (Dodgers No. 11)As one scout put it, ""How many high school guys have hit in the middle of an AFL lineup 18 months after being drafted?"" Hope hit just .228/.301/.446 but he was the Fall League's most dynamic player, with some evaluators giving him well-above-average grades for raw power, speed and arm strength. 11. Moises Ballesteros, C, Mesa (Cubs No. 4/MLB No. 44)Ballesteros' sweet left-handed swing and advanced approach have enabled him to succeed against older competition throughout his career, including batting .316/.376/.557 with five homers in 19 Fall League games. His defensive and conditioning have improved in the past two years, but scouts still wonder whether he'll be able to catch regularly in the big leagues. 12. Josue Briceño, 1B, Scottsdale (Tigers No. 9)Briceño won the Joe Black MVP award after leading the AFL in batting (.433), slugging (.867), OPS (1.376), hits (39), homers (10), RBIs (27), extra-base hits (17) and total bases (78). That might be the most impressive offensive performance in league history adding in the fact that he turned 20 just before the season started. Featuring a simple left-handed swing and gameplan, he makes repeated hard contact and doesn't try to do too much at the plate. Though he has caught in the past, the Tigers should give that up and look to maximize his bat. 13. Xavier Isaac, 1B, Mesa (Rays No. 2/MLB No. 36)That's five first basemen in the top 13 if you're counting, and Isaac smoked balls harder than most Fall Leaguers despite being just 20 years old. He did post the highest strikeout rate (40 percent) in the league and will need to do a better job of catching up to high fastballs to tap into his power potential. 14. Jett Williams, SS/OF, Scottsdale (Mets No. 2/MLB No. 52)Williams could be a top-of-the-lineup catalyst with his patient approach, sneaky pop and plus speed, which translated into 17 walks, seven extra-base hits and seven steals in 22 games. He could stand to be more aggressive within the strike zone and may fit better at second base or center field than shortstop. 15. Drake Baldwin, C, Peoria (Braves No. 5)Baldwin raked at a .377/.452/.491 clip before leaving to play for Team USA at the Premier12 tournament. He's a steady hitter with average power and continues to improve defensively, erasing any doubts that he can remain at catcher. 16. Thayron Liranzo, C, Scottsdale (Tigers No. 6)Evaluators ranked the catchers behind Salas in a variety of different orders. Liranzo slashed .375/.492/.667 and comes with more power but fewer bat-to-ball skills than Ballesteros and Baldwin. He has more arm strength than either, but his catching needs a lot of polish. 17. Termarr Johnson, 2B, Scottsdale (Pirates No. 3/MLB No. 75)Another Premier12 participant, Johnson remains a conundrum who hasn't approached the 70 hit grades scouts gave him in high school. His on-base ability remains a strength as he batted .250/.444/.475 with 14 walks in 11 games, but he's now more of a power-over-hit guy who's an average-at-best runner and defender. 18. Tre' Morgan, OF, Mesa (Rays No. 10)While Morgan is the top defensive first baseman in the Minors, the Rays wanted him to expand his defensive horizons with Mesa, where he looked potentially adequate in left field. He hit .338/.391/.500 and finished third with an 8 percent strikeout rate -- some scouts thought he had the best approach in the AFL -- but he'll need to prove he can get to average power. 19. Edwin Arroyo, SS, Glendale (Reds No. 3/MLB No. 65)After losing all of the 2024 season to surgery on his non-throwing shoulder, Arroyo proved he hadn't lost anything defensively while playing the best shortstop in the Fall League. His bat is more ordinary and he slashed just .253/.309/.333, but he should provide enough offense to be a big league regular. 20. Thomas Saggese, 2B, Surprise (Cardinals No. 4)While Saggese lacks a plus tool, he's a solid hitter without a glaring weakness. He finished second in the batting race at .391/.524/.594, provides gap power and his instincts enable him to play quicker than his fringy speed on the bases and in the field. 21. Kemp Alderman, OF, Peoria (Marlins No. 12)Alderman played just nine games before leaving to get married, but that was long enough to tie for second with six homers and record the highest exit velocity (119.5 mph) of the season. He earns some top-of-the-scale grades for his raw power, also offers plus arm strength and draws some Hunter Renfroe comps. 22. Alejandro Osuna, OF, Surprise (Rangers No. 16)Osuna is a polished lefty hitter with 20-homer potential and good defensive instincts, though he fits best in left field. The younger brother of former All-Star closer Roberto Osuna and the nephew of ex-big leaguer Antonio Osuna, he topped the Fall League with 22 walks in 25 games, batted .306/.438/.449 and won the Dernell Stenson Sportsmanship Award. 23. Drew Gilbert, OF, Scottsdale (Mets No. 3/MLB No. 74)Few Fall Leaguers could match the energy Gilbert brings to the park every day, though he hit just .208/.380/.403 with four homers and 17 walks in 21 games. He offers the possibility of four solid tools, though questions about whether he can get to average power limit his ceiling. 24. Denzel Clarke, OF, Mesa (Athletics No. 10)Though Clarke repeated Double-A at age 24, it's easy to dream on a 6-foot-4, 220-pound center fielder with difference-making speed and at least plus raw power. His approach has been an issue in the Minors but not in the AFL, where he slashed .382/.495/.566 with a league-best three triples. 25. Tommy Troy, 2B, Salt River (D-backs No. 5)Troy recovered from a 1-for-25 start to bat .382 the rest of the way, recapturing the line-drive hitting ability that made him the 12th overall pick in the 2023 Draft. He's definitely a second baseman and not a shortstop, with his 20/20 upside helping him to clear the offensive bar at the less challenging position. 26. Carter Jensen, C, Surprise (Royals No. 5)One of the more underrated catching prospects in the game, Jensen combines average pop with on-base ability. He led the league in on-base percentage while hitting .425/.582/.800 with four homers in 12 games and providing sound defense. 27. Creed Willems, C, Surprise (Orioles No. 22)Signed for a well-over-slot $1 million as a 2001 eighth-rounder out of a Texas high school, Willems showed some of the best raw power and arm strength in the Fall League. He slashed .338/.391/.500 with two homers in 19 games and caught better than scouts expected. 28. Robert Hassell, OF, Salt River (Nationals No. 13)The eighth overall choice in the 2020 Draft and part of the blockbuster Juan Soto trade in August 2022, Hassell stands out more for his floor than his ceiling. A line-drive hitter who provides solid speed, arm strength and defense, he slashed .281/.360/.517 with four homers and five steals in 19 games. 29. Caleb Durbin, INF/OF, Salt River (not ranked on Yankees Top 30)The best basestealer in AFL history, Durbin set league records for swipes in a game (four), season (29 in 24 games) and career (50 in 47 contests the last two years). He also batted .313/.427/.548 with five homers this fall, playing his way onto the Yankees' 40-man roster with his contact hitting ability, solid speed and defensive versatility. He fits best at second base. 30. Luis Mey, RHP, Glendale (not ranked on Reds Top 30)Another unranked prospect who earned a 40-man spot, Mey garnered Reliever of the Year accolades with a spotless 0.00 ERA, .037 average-against and a league-high six saves in as many opportunities. He threw the 34 hardest pitches recorded in the Fall League, parking at 99.5 mph with his fastball and peaking at 101.8. His seldom-used mid-80s cutter tops out at 90 mph and also misses bats."
MLB News,"Hays to be non-tendered, become a free agent (report)",https://www.mlb.com/news/phillies-non-tender-deadline-moves-in-2024,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 19:13:49 GMT",,"Todd Zolecki PHILADELPHIA -- The Phillies needed a right-handed bat to pound left-handed pitching, so in July they traded Seranthony Domínguez to the Orioles for outfielder Austin Hays. The deal didn’t work as planned. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported on Friday afternoon that the Phillies told Hays he will be non-tendered before Friday’s 8 p.m. ET deadline, which will make him a free agent. Hays strained a left hamstring shortly after he joined the Phillies, then he missed several weeks because of a kidney infection. It sapped him of his speed and strength, and as a result he did not start Game 4 of the NL Division Series against the Mets, despite New York starting left-hander José Quintana. Hays, 29, batted .256 with two home runs, six RBIs and a .672 OPS in 22 games with the Phillies. He went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts in the postseason. The Phillies have not announced their plans for other salary-arbitration eligible players before Friday's deadline. Other eligible players include Alec Bohm, Brandon Marsh, José Ruiz, Edmundo Sosa, Bryson Stott, Garrett Stubbs and Ranger Suárez."

MLB News,"O's to non-tender Webb, settle with Rivera (sources)",https://www.mlb.com/news/orioles-non-tender-jacob-webb,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 23:04:08 GMT",,"Jake Rill BALTIMORE -- Another fairly surprising bullpen decision has been made by the Orioles. Multiple sources told MLB.com on Friday that Baltimore is planning to non-tender right-hander Jacob Webb, who has spent the past two seasons with the O’s. The club has not yet confirmed the move, which will happen prior to the 8 p.m. ET tender deadline. Webb will become a free agent a little more than two weeks after the Orioles declined the $4 million 2025 team option for left-hander Danny Coulombe, who was also a key part of the ‘pen the past two seasons. Baltimore entered Friday with 13 arbitration-eligible players, many of whom are expected to be tendered contracts. That group will include infielder Emmanuel Rivera, who has avoided arb by settling with the O’s on a $1 million contract for next season, a source told MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand. Rivera slashed .313/.370/.578 over 27 games for the Orioles in 2024. On Aug. 7, 2023, the Orioles claimed Webb off waivers from the Angels. The righty went on to post a 3.27 ERA over 25 appearances while helping Baltimore win the American League East title and finish 101-61 that season. Webb made the Opening Day bullpen in 2024, then fared even better. The 31-year-old had a 3.02 ERA and a 1.18 WHIP in 56 2/3 innings over 60 outings this year. Now, he’ll be hitting free agency, leaving the O’s with another hole to fill in their relief corps. Last year, the Orioles went to arbitration with Webb, who won his case and made $1 million during the 2024 season. MLB Trade Rumors was projecting Webb’s salary to increase to $1.7 million in arb this year."
MLB News,Could Ichiro become the Hall of Fame's first unanimous position player?,https://www.mlb.com/news/ichiro-suzuki-s-case-for-a-unanimous-bbwaa-hall-of-fame-bid,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:31:31 GMT",,"Daniel Kramer This story was excerpted from Daniel Kramer’s Mariners Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. SEATTLE -- It’s not a matter of if Ichiro Suzuki will be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, but rather, if he’ll become the first position player to do so unanimously via the vote from the Baseball Writers’ Association of America. Suzuki was among 14 newcomers on this year’s BBWAA ballot, which was revealed earlier this week -- along with fellow Mariners icon Félix Hernández -- and will likely be a shoe-in when the results are announced on Jan. 21, live on MLB Network. But the question is whether Suzuki will be listed on each ballot, an accumulation that has eluded all 346 Hall of Famers other than Mariano Rivera, the longtime Yankees closer. Even Mariners great Ken Griffey Jr., widely considered to be among the greatest players of his era, if not all-time, was left off three of the 440 ballots in the 2016 class. Derek Jeter was the closest to the achievement but was left off one single ballot among the 397 in ‘20. There were 400 ballots sent to eligible BBWAA members for 2025. The number fluctuates each year based on criteria, specifically that voters must be active and/or honorary members who’ve been active baseball writers for at least 10 years. Last year, there were 385. Though most voters publicly reveal their ballots -- which are masterfully (though unofficially) tracked by social media personality Ryan Thibodaux -- many do not because they are permitted to keep it anonymous. Even within a massive group of journalists, it can consistently create a lack of transparency. There was notable outcry in the cases of Jeter and Griffey, but this issue goes back even further, to the likes of Babe Ruth, Willie Mays and Hank Aaron. All that is to say that it unfortunately wouldn’t be a significant shock if Suzuki is not unanimous, even if it does seem egregious if that comes to fruition. Suzuki’s numbers speak for themselves. He was a two-time American League batting champion and 10-time Gold Glove Award winner, hitting .311 with 117 homers, 780 RBIs and 509 stolen bases with the Mariners (2001-12, 2018-19), the Yankees (2012-14) and Marlins (2015-17). He had a record 262 hits in 2004. But a unanimous HOF selection should not merely consist of a player’s on-field performance, and this is where Suzuki should unquestionably shine. His influence on the game itself has been -- and remains -- global. Moreover, Suzuki exemplified excellence and professionalism, and his relentless pursuit of greatness over two decades made him a beloved figure not only in Seattle but around the world, both among fans, teammates and peers. Suzuki was also a bellwether for Japanese position players, as the first such player to be posted and signed to an MLB club -- ahead of that historic 2001 season in which he won the AL Rookie of the Year and MVP Awards -- paving the way for greats like Hideki Matsui, Nori Aoki and even Shohei Ohtani. He took great pride, but also put great pressure on himself, treating the opportunity more as a responsibility. “I felt like I really carried that on my shoulders,” Suzuki told MLB.com ahead of the 2023 All-Star Game in Seattle, through longtime interpreter Allen Turner. “Like, people are going to judge the position players of Japan from the performance that I have here in MLB. And so I really took that to heart. I just wanted to make sure that, of course, failure was not an option. But even if I just had OK numbers, that wasn't good enough.” He still has great influence on the game, too, as a special assistant to the chairman with the Mariners. He’s a regular presence at T-Mobile Park throughout the season, and has developed a special bond with the future of the franchise, Julio Rodríguez. “He's been through so many different things and I know he's such a wise man,” Rodríguez said in 2023. “And it's true. ... He's helped me out a lot."" Suzuki was a revolutionary talent who paved the way for others to follow, and he continues to give back to the game. He embodies as much of a unanimous selection as anyone who’s reached this point. “I think you can say that this is my life,” Suzuki said in that 2023 interview. “There's nothing else I can do but this so this is kind of why I'm here, why I'm alive.”"
MLB News,Witt wins '24 Heart & Hustle Award: 'Truly an honor',https://www.mlb.com/news/bobby-witt-jr-wins-heart-and-hustle-award-2024,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:20:00 GMT",,"Anne Rogers Paul Casella One day after finishing as the runner-up for the American League MVP Award, Royals superstar Bobby Witt Jr. was named the 2024 recipient of the Heart & Hustle Award on Friday morning. • All-time Heart & Hustle Award winners The honor, created by the MLB Players Alumni Association in 2005, is given annually to an active player who ""demonstrates a passion for the game of baseball and best embodies the values, spirit and traditions of the game."" The alumni committee selects one nominee from each team before the winner is determined by a vote amongst fans, alumni and active players. “Hey guys, it’s truly an honor to receive the Heart and Hustle Award,” Witt said on MLB Network in a pre-recorded message. “I just want to thank all my coaches, my teammates, the fans, my family and friends. Everyone who was involved in this season. This award means a lot to me just because it was voted on by the players and the alumni, and I’m just very thankful for everyone who voted for me. It’s truly an honor. Thank you.” Witt, who was also Kansas City's nominee in 2022 and '23, is the first Royals player to win the Heart & Hustle Award. This is just the latest honor for the 24-year-old Witt, who won his first career Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Awards earlier this offseason. Witt won the MLB batting title this season with a .332 average while posting career highs in home runs (32), RBIs (109), doubles (45), OPS (.977) and bWAR (9.4). • Ranking the top 5 moments from Witt's historic '24 season Witt also swiped 31 bases on his way to recording his second straight 30-30 season. He is one of just three active players with multiple 30-30 seasons, along with Ronald Acuña Jr. and José Ramírez -- and is the first shortstop to do so.  Witt is also the only player in AL/NL history with multiple such campaigns before his age-25 season. Thank you! @MLBPAA Truly an honor! https://t.co/MwZjZRSCyS On the field through his talent and production, as well as off the field through his work ethic and competitiveness, Witt has established himself as one of the Royals’ leaders alongside captain Salvador Perez, who often states that Witt is the best player he’s ever played with. The Royals rally around their shortstop, who took them to new heights this year by making the postseason for the first time since their 2015 World Series title. Witt has also embraced the Kansas City community as his home following the 11-year extension he signed with the Royals last offseason. This past July, Witt hosted a youth baseball clinic with 100% of the proceeds going to Answering the Call (ATC), a non-profit organization that supports first responders after severe injury or illness, on behalf of Sarah Nauser, a retired police officer battling ALS and one of the Royals’ biggest fans."
MLB News,Ohtani's now been a unanimous MVP THREE times,https://www.mlb.com/news/shohei-ohtani-2024-nl-mvp,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:29:59 GMT",,"Juan Toribio LOS ANGELES -- Since coming to the Majors in 2018, Shohei Ohtani has made history at every turn. He can now add another historic accomplishment to his already decorated career. After posting the best offensive season of his career, which saw him become the first player to reach the 50-50 club, Ohtani won the third BBWAA Most Valuable Player Award of his career on Thursday, becoming the first full-time designated hitter to accomplish the feat. Ohtani, who is the first Dodger to win the award since Cody Bellinger in 2019, was chosen unanimously for the third time in his career, becoming the first player to do so. He joined Frank Robinson as the only players to win at least one MVP Award in both leagues and is the first back-to-back winner since Miguel Cabrera in 2012-13. The Japanese superstar became the sixth player to win an MVP Award with two franchises, regardless of league, since BBWAA voting began in 1931. Of those, only Barry Bonds and Ohtani have taken home the prize in their final year with one team and then in their first with a new club. “This MVP, I’m just representing the Dodgers,” Ohtani said through interpreter Matt Hidaka on the announcement show Thursday night on MLB Network. “It was a complete team effort. I wouldn’t have been able to receive this award if it weren’t for my teammates.” Fittingly, then, it was Ohtani’s teammate Clayton Kershaw who announced the award. Kershaw, who won the NL MVP in 2014, made the announcement, then congratulated Ohtani, who was all smiles amid family and friends. (Ohtani’s beloved dog, Decoy, scampered off the couch at the excitement.) En route to his third MVP, Ohtani beat out Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor, who finished second, and D-backs second baseman Ketel Marte, who finished third. After signing a historic 10-year, $700 million deal last offseason, all eyes were on Ohtani to perform. But even with the massive expectations, Ohtani was able to exceed them all in his first season with the Dodgers. As he rehabbed from a second major right elbow surgery, Ohtani put together the best offensive season of his career. Despite a slow start at the plate, Ohtani led the NL with 9.2 bWAR. He also led the NL in runs scored (134), homers (54), RBIs (130), on-base percentage (.390), slugging percentage (.646) and OPS (1.036). Ohtani, of course, also became the first player in baseball history to hit 50 or more homers and steal 50 or more bases in the same season. He accomplished that feat by delivering arguably the best single-game performance in Major League history, a 6-for-6, three-homer masterpiece against the Marlins at loanDepot park.

Though Ohtani put up otherworldly numbers, there were still questions about whether a full-time DH should win the MVP Award. In the past, it was something that was used against players in MVP discussions. Heading into September, Ohtani appeared to be in a tight race with Lindor, who was leading the Mets to a postseason berth as the everyday shortstop. But in the final month of the regular season, as the Dodgers chased down another NL West title, Ohtani saved his best for last. In the final 26 games of the regular season, Ohtani hit 10 homers, drove in 32 runs and posted a 1.225 OPS, his best mark of any month in 2024. Those numbers helped the Dodgers edge out the Padres for the division and solidified Ohtani’s place as the clear frontrunner to win his third MVP Award. “I obviously don’t go into the season trying to strive to get the MVP Award,"" said Ohtani. ""I was more focused on being one of the guys with a new team with the Dodgers. I wanted to obviously embrace the fans as well and let them learn who I was. That was my main focus.” Ohtani also played an integral part in the Dodgers’ World Series title, the first of his career. He became the first player since teammate Mookie Betts to win MVP in the same year his team won the World Series. In just about every way, Ohtani’s first season with the Dodgers was about as perfect as it gets. Ohtani hopes to continue making more history along the way. “The ultimate goal from the beginning was to win a World Series, which we were able to accomplish,” Ohtani said. “Like I said before, I receive this award on behalf of my team. The next goal is for me to do it again. So right now, I’m in the middle of rehab [from left shoulder surgery] and working out and getting stronger. “I’m looking forward to next season so we can run it back.”"
MLB News,Judge joins exalted company with 2nd MVP Award,https://www.mlb.com/news/aaron-judge-is-unanimous-2024-al-mvp,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 01:30:00 GMT","Captain joins DiMaggio, Berra, Mantle, Maris and Rodriguez in garnering multiple honors; Soto finishes third","Bryan Hoch NEW YORK -- There were some who wondered if we might ever see a better Aaron Judge season than his terrific and memorable 2022 MVP campaign, during which he eclipsed Roger Maris’ 61-year-old single-season American League home run record while seemingly singlehandedly powering his Yankees into the postseason. Then came the captain’s impressive 2024 performance. Instead of grainy black-and-white replays of Maris’ home runs, there was crystal-clear high-definition video of Judge and teammate Juan Soto -- arguably the league’s most lethal one-two offensive punch in recent memory -- performing their “Kings of New York” handshake at home plate. • All-time Most Valuable Player Award winners Many of Judge’s Major League-leading 58 homers led to cries of “M-V-P!” from adoring crowds, both home and road. That manifested on Thursday, when Judge won his second BBWAA American League Most Valuable Player Award, as announced on MLB Network. “I appreciate all the votes, all the support,” Judge said. “I honestly wouldn’t be in this position without my teammates, all the coaching we had this year. It’s such a blessing. I’ve got to thank God every day for this opportunity to be here, to wear pinstripes and do it in New York.” Judge received all 30 first-place votes, with the Royals’ Bobby Witt Jr. (30 second-place votes) finishing ahead of Soto. Since the Baseball Writers' Association of America began casting votes in 1931, Judge is the seventh Yankee to win multiple MVP Awards, joining Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Maris and Alex Rodriguez. The honor figures to be bittersweet for Judge, however, as he struggled in the postseason and committed a costly error in the decisive World Series Game 5 against the Dodgers. Judge said that falling short in the Fall Classic would “stay with me until I die,” as he has long valued team accomplishments above individual performances. But he was appreciative of the award. Another incredible season for the ages.Your 2024 American League MVP: Aaron Judge. pic.twitter.com/JXAWF0qkcu “It means a lot, a lot of the hard work in the offseason, during the season, the ups and downs throughout it,” Judge said. “Just the constant support from my teammates, the fans in New York, just everybody to help me get to this spot.” • Complete MVP vote totals Looking at Judge’s impressive .322/.458/.701 slash line, it is difficult to believe that his season got off to a slow start; he was batting .197 as late as May 2 as questions swirled. The Yankees didn’t seem concerned, with manager Aaron Boone remarking that Judge would soon catch fire. Did he ever. Judge went on to lead the Majors in homers, RBIs (144), on-base percentage, slugging percentage, OPS (1.159), walks (133), times on base (322), game-winning RBIs (24) and position player fWAR (11.2). He also became the fastest to reach 300 homers in terms of at-bats and games played. “I want to congratulate Aaron on earning this distinguished honor, and I couldn’t be happier for such an amazing person and leader,” Boone said in a statement. “After having a front-row seat for his 2022 MVP performance, I really couldn’t envision a player having a better and more complete baseball season. But that’s exactly what he accomplished in 2024. “I’m beyond fortunate to be able to manage Aaron, and I look forward to watching him further cement his legacy as one of this generation’s greatest players.” As Giancarlo Stanton remarked late in the season, it seemed at times as though Judge was “out there playing video games while all of us are out there working."" Comparing this year’s MVP campaign with his first, in ’22, his batting average was 11 points higher, his on-base percentage was 33 points higher, and his slugging percentage was 15 points higher -- all done while absorbing the increased wear and tear of playing center field regularly (105 games) to accommodate Soto’s arrival. “March and April were not my friend this year,” Judge said. “It’s just a testament to [the fact that] it’s a long season. You’re going to go through some ups and downs. It’s just about leaning on your teammates, on your family. Just put in the work and things are going to change. You can’t mope, you can’t feel sorry for yourself.” Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Judge has expressed awe at the hallowed statistical company he now keeps. For example, only he, Babe Ruth, Gehrig and Mantle have led the league in homers at least three times. Those names are littered throughout the paragraphs detailing his success; already his place in Monument Park seems all but reserved. Yet unlike in ’22, when he was asked how he might muster an encore, the ’24 showing provides an answer -- had his ’23 season not been interrupted by injury, he might be celebrating a third straight MVP. This may be considered the baseline performance expected of Judge moving forward, setting this ultimatum: Now it must translate into a World Series championship. “You’ve got to put in the work, continue to make changes, you’ve got to continue to try to improve yourself until they rip this jersey off of you,” Judge said."

But not all MVP seasons are treated equally. Some MVP seasons just happen to be the best that particular year, and some can stand among the best of all time. Today, we come to you having completed a Herculean task: We come to rank every MVP season ever. Starting in 1931 -- the first year the Baseball Writers' Association of America voted on an award for both leagues -- we're looking at all 189 MVP seasons and pitting them against each other. We'll use a variety of ways to judge them, from Wins Above Replacement to historical import to the background of the quality of the league itself the year a particular player won their award. And I'm sure we'll get a bunch of them wrong. But who is the most MVPest of all the MVPs? Let's dive in. Remember: All these guys were great. There is only honor in being on this list, whatever place you finish at. • Ranking every Cy Young season | Ranking every Rookie of the Year 1. Barry Bonds, 2001 NL (Giants)Key stats: 259 OPS+, 73 HR, 177 BBThe 73 homers is probably enough for me. Is it not enough for you?Runner-up: Sammy Sosa, CHC (64 HR) 2. Bob Gibson, 1968 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: 1.12 ERA, 258 ERA+, 13 shutoutsThe pitching season by which all other pitching seasons will forever be judged.Runner-up: Pete Rose, CIN (.335 BA) 3. Barry Bonds, 2004 NL (Giants)Key stats: 263 OPS+, 232 BB, 120 IBBThis one isn't first overall only because Bonds barely played defense at all. But heavens: A .609 OBP!Runner-up: Adrian Beltre, LAD (163 OPS+) 4. Mickey Mantle, 1956 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 210 OPS+, 52 HR, 130 RBIsThis was Mantle at his absolute peak, aged 24 and perfect in every possible way.Runner-up: Yogi Berra, NYY (105 RBIs) 5. Barry Bonds, 2002 NL (Giants)Key stats: .370 BA, .799 SLG, 268 OPS+This was actually the highest OPS+ of Bonds' career.Runner-up: Albert Pujols, STL (127 RBIs) 6. Willie Mays, 1965 NL (Giants)Key stats: 185 OPS+, 52 HR, 112 RBIsNot only is it amazing that Mays put up the numbers he did this year at 34, but he also did it while revolutionizing the position defensively.Runner-up: Sandy Koufax, LAD (382 K) 7. Aaron Judge, 2024 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 58 HR, 1.159 OPS, 223 OPS+OK, so he hit four fewer homers than he did in 2022. In every other way, however, he was better in 2024. A very strong argument could be made that this was the best offensive season by a right-handed hitter, ever.Runner-up: Bobby Witt Jr., Royals (32 HR, 31 SB) 8. Aaron Judge, 2022 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 62 HR, 1.111 OPS, 211 OPS+Then again: 62 homers are 62 homers. The only difference between Judge’s two MVP seasons may end up being that he had Juan Soto hitting in front of him for one of them. (Not this one.)Runner-up: Shohei Ohtani, Angels (34 HR, 95 RBIs and 15-9, 219 K's in 166 IP) 9. Carl Yastrzemski, 1967 AL (Red Sox)Key stats: .326 BA, 193 OPS+, 44 HRActually the highest WAR on this entire list (12.4).Runner-up: Harmon Killebrew, MIN (44 HR) 10. Stan Musial, 1948 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: .376 BA, 200 OPS+, 131 RBIsMusial hit .376 and had a career high in homers.Runner-up: Johnny Sain, BSN (2.60 ERA) 11. Joe Morgan, 1975 NL (Reds)Key stats: .327 BA, 169 OPS+, 67 SBMorgan's best year, for maybe the best team of the past 50 years.Runner-up: Greg Luzinski, PHI (120 RBIs) 12.

Mickey Mantle, 1957 AL (Yankees)Key stats: .365 BA, 221 OPS+, 34 HRMantle might not have had the longevity of his peers, but no one has ever looked more physically built solely to play baseball.Runner-up: Ted Williams, BOS (.526 OBP) 14. Willie Mays, 1954 NL (Giants)Key stats: .345 BA, 175 OPS+, 41 HRThis was Mays' first year back from military service. He was not rusty.Runner-up: Ted Kluszewski, CIN (49 HR) 15. Shohei Ohtani, 2021 AL (Angels)Key stats: 46 homers, 158 OPS+, eight triples, 9-2 record, 3.18 ERA, 156 strikeouts, 1.09 WHIPPutting Ohtani’s season in context felt impossible because it literally was unprecedented. This might seem high, but it's likely to grow in stature as the years go on.Runner-up: Vladimir Guerrero Jr., TOR (48 homers, 1.002 OPS) 16. Cal Ripken Jr., 1991 AL (Orioles)Key stats: .323 BA, 34 HR, 114 RBIsRipken was credited with 11.5 WAR - the 10th best all-time. And Ripken didn't miss a game all year as his Iron Man streak chugged along.Runner-up: Cecil Fielder, DET (133 RBIs) 17. Mike Trout, 2016 AL (Angels)Key stats: 173 OPS+, 123 R, 100 RBIsHis WAR total (per Baseball Reference) was 10.5, which is the highest of any of his three MVP seasons. And surpassing 10 WAR is rare. There have been just 30 position player seasons to reach that threshold since integration (1947).Runner-up: Mookie Betts, BOS (214 H) 18. Jimmie Foxx, 1932 AL (A's)Key stats: 207 OPS+, 58 HR, 169 RBIsFoxx should probably be as household a name as Gehrig, anyway.Runner-up: Lou Gehrig, NYY (181 OPS+) 19. Ted Williams, 1946 AL (Red Sox)Key stats: .497 OBP, 215 OPS+, 123 RBIsThis was Williams' first year back from the war, and it was as if he hadn't missed a day.Runner-up: Hal Newhouser, DET (26-9) 20. Shohei Ohtani, 2023 AL (Angels)Key stats: 44 HR, 1.066 OPS, 10-5, 3.14 ERAIt feels strange having to rank any Ohtani season against anybody else’s: No one has ever done what he does. We’ll put this second award slightly behind his first one, if only because he didn’t play much in the final month. But all of these are going to age terrifically.Runner-up: Corey Seager, TEX (170 OPS+) 21. Robin Yount, 1982 AL (Brewers)Key stats: .331 BA, 129 R, 114 RBIsIf the Brewers had won the World Series that season, this might be in the top 10.Runner-up: Eddie Murray, BAL (156 OPS+) 22.

Albert Pujols, 2009 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: 189 OPS+, 47 HR, 135 RBIsThis was Pujols' last truly breathtaking season. This was what it was like to see Williams.Runner-up: Hanley Ramirez, FLA (.342 BA) 24. Alex Rodríguez, 2007 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 176 OPS+, 54 HR, 156 RBIsEven with this incredible year, there were still Yankees fans who would have voted for Derek Jeter.Runner-up: Magglio Ordonez, DET (.363 BA) 25. Ted Williams, 1949 AL (Red Sox)Key stats: .490 OBP, 191 OPS+, 159 RBIsThis was Williams' final MVP season, but it's difficult to argue he didn't deserve four or five more.Runner-up: Phil Rizzuto, NYY (110 R) 26. Bryce Harper, 2015 NL (Nationals)Key stats: .330 BA, 198 OPS+, 42 HRHarper was so great in his first MVP season he may spend the rest of his career trying to live it down … or maybe someday even match it.Runner-up: Paul Goldschmidt, ARI (168 OPS+) 27. Shohei Ohtani, 2024 NL (Dodgers)Key stats: 54 HR, 59 SB, 190 OPS+His third MVP may have featured his greatest offensive season, but of course, this one drops below his other two MVPs because he didn’t pitch at all this year. Though he did end up winning a World Series.Runner-up: Francisco Lindor, Mets (33 HR, 29 SB) Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. 28. Ronald Acuña Jr., 2023 NL (Braves)Key stats: 41 HR, 73 SBDid you think that a 40-70 season was even possible before Acuña did this? He also led the NL in OPS, runs and hits, for good measure.Runner-up: Mookie Betts, LAD (8.3 bWAR) 29. Rickey Henderson, 1990 AL (A's)Key stats: 189 OPS+, 28 HR, 65 SBHenderson's true value could never be entirely calculated … but you sure can come close.Runner-up: Cecil Fielder, DET (51 HR) 30.

Statistically, it wasn't as impressive as a lot of other seasons it's ahead of on this list. But how do you discount the greatness of '61? This spot seems right.Runner-up: Mickey Mantle, NYY (54 HR) 39.

Albert Pujols, 2005 NL (Cardinals)Key stats: .330 BA, 168 OPS+, 41 HRPujols may have actually been better the year before, but he had teammates Jim Edmonds and Scott Rolen to compete with.Runner-up: Andruw Jones, ATL (51 HR) 70.

Josh Hamilton, 2010 AL (Rangers)Key stats: .359 BA, .633 SLG, 170 OPS+Hamilton had a short peak, but it sure was breathtaking while it lasted.Runner-up: Miguel Cabrera, DET (178 OPS+) 75. Mickey Mantle, 1962 AL (Yankees)Key stats: .321 BA, 195 OPS+, 30 HRThis wasn't a terrific WAR year for Mantle, and he had 24 fewer homers than he did the year before, but this was also the second-highest OBP of his career.Runner-up: Bobby Richardson, NYY (.302 BA) 76. Pete Rose, 1973 NL (Reds)Key stats: .338 BA, 115 R, 230 HRose made 17 All-Star teams but only won this lone MVP, which feels about right.Runner-up: Willie Stargell, PIT (186 OPS+) 77. Roger Clemens, 1986 AL (Red Sox)Key stats: 24-4, 2.48 ERA, 169 ERA+The only problem with this season is that Clemens had about six non-MVP seasons that were better.Runner-up: Don Mattingly, NYY (.352 BA) 78. Kris Bryant, 2016 NL (Cubs)Key stats: 146 OPS+, 39 HR, 102 RBIsBryant was probably even better in 2017, but you get extra credit when you, you know, end the longest championship drought in professional sports.Runner-up: Daniel Murphy, WSH (.347 BA) 79. Jimmie Foxx, 1938 AL (Red Sox)Key stats: 182 OPS+, 50 HR, 175 RBIsFoxx was such an amazing hitter.

Freddie Freeman, 2020 NL (Braves)Key stats: .341/.462/.640, 186 OPS+You have to adjust SOMEWHAT for a 60-game season in the middle of a pandemic.

Hal Newhouser, 1945 AL (Tigers)Key stats: 25-9, 1.81 ERA, 195 ERA+Speaking of which, it's probably time to deal with Newhouser, who was dominant in 1944 and '45, but mostly because he had a heart murmur and couldn't join the armed forces. This allowed him to tower over what was essentially replacement-level talent. Newhouser was great, but he didn't have to face Williams those two years.Runner-up: Eddie Mayo, DET (112 OPS+) 95.

Yogi Berra, 1954 AL (Yankees)Key stats: .307 BA, 136 OPS+, 125 RBIsYou try not to be betrothed to WAR here, but it must be pointed out that Berra's 5.4 WAR this year was roughly what Whit Merrifield's was in 2018.Runner-up: Larry Doby, CLE (126 RBIs) 135.

Frank Thomas, 1994 AL (White Sox)Key stats: .353 BA, 212 OPS+, 38 HRThomas won MVP the year before, so at least he can say he had a full-season MVP in addition to a strike-shortened one.Runner-up: Ken Griffey Jr., SEA (40 HR) 141.

Vladimir Guerrero, 2004 AL (Angels)Key stats: .337 BA, 39 HR, 126 RBIsVlad never had the OBP numbers to crack truly rarified air historically, but he was always the MVP for pure pleasantness to watch.Runner-up: Gary Sheffield, NYY (121 RBIs) 153. Yogi Berra, 1951 AL (Yankees)Key stats: 130 OPS+, 27 HR, 88 RBIsWhat do you do with Yogi? He won three MVPs, but none of them were historically dominating seasons statistically.

Juan Gonzalez, 1998 AL (Rangers)Key stats: .318 BA, 45 HR, 157 RBIsThe counting stats are incredible, but there's an argument for any number of other fearsome sluggers that year, including Albert Belle, Mo Vaughn and Manny Ramirez. Not to mention, you had the likes of Derek Jeter, Ken Griffey, Jr. and Alex Rodriguez, all of whom had very strong cases.Runner-up: Nomar Garciaparra, BOS (.323 BA) 176.

Jackie Jensen, 1958 AL (Red Sox)Key stats: 148 OPS+, 35 HR, 122 RBIsJensen had a bunch of homers and RBIs, but you could argue teammates Pete Runnels and a 39-year-old Ted Williams were both better.Runner-up: Bob Turley, NYY (21-7) 179.

MLB News,Juggernaut Japan cements spot in Premier12 gold medal game,https://www.mlb.com/news/premier12-super-round-scores-and-results,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 14:13:00 GMT",,"Michael Clair TOKYO -- Four teams are left to battle for the title of Premier12 champions -- the international tournament that pits the top 12 ranked baseball nations against each other and has helped spur the career of many future Major Leaguers. The top two teams from each group -- Venezuela and the United States from Group A and Japan and Chinese Taipei from Group B -- advanced to the super round, where they will now play a three-day round robin to determine which two teams will face off in the championship game on Sunday. There will be two games held each day at the Tokyo Dome (start times are 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. ET) and the action is available to be streamed with a subscription to DAZN in the United States and Canada. As we work toward the championship game, we’ll keep you updated with the outcomes of each super-round game in this story. Super-round Game 1: Venezuela 2, Chinese Taipei 0 Venezuela powered its way through the group stage, going 4-1 to take first place thanks to an experienced lineup with plenty of pop. On Thursday afternoon at the Tokyo Dome, that trend continued: Carlos Eduardo Pérez (one of two catchers named Carlos Pérez on the roster) -- who saw Major League action in parts of five seasons, most recently with the A’s in 2023 -- hit a two-run home run in the fourth inning to give Venezuela a lead that it would never relinquish. 🇻🇪💪 Arepa Power, Carlos Perez with the Home Run! #Premier12 || @Premier12 pic.twitter.com/75nvEJtxLU After Nivaldo Rodriguez -- who went 10-4 with a 2.16 ERA in the CPBL this past season, making him very familiar with the Chinese Taipei lineup -- pitched four shutout innings, Venezuela manager Omar López then utilized his bullpen to perfection. Seven relievers followed -- five of them recording just one out (there is no batter minimum in the Premier12 tournament) -- to finish off the shutout. ""The reason why we're getting stronger is because we have the Venezuelan name on our chest,"" López said after the game. ""And when you have the Venezuelan name, when you wear the jersey, there is nothing better than that. Nothing. Nothing. It's pride, it's honor and it's privilege."" Game 2: Japan 9, United States 1 For four innings, it was one of the most unlikely pitching duels you'll ever see: On one side was 44-year-old USA starter Rich Hill, a veteran of nearly 400 big league games who befuddled and bewitched Samurai Japan batters with an endless bevy of slow curves that at times barely crested 70 mph. On the other was Hitaro Takahashi, the young Japanese ace who is half Hill’s age, armed with a 98 mph fastball and diving low-90s split-finger. Despite the difference in styles, the two matched each other: Hill gave up one hit and struck out five. Takahashi, with dreams of the big leagues and MLB scouts in attendance, gave up two hits and struck out eight. Once pulled though, the runs came: A’s No. 7 prospect Colby Thomas, who hit 31 home runs in the Minors last year, blasted a solo shot to right-field in the top of the fifth, flapping the ""USA"" on his chest as he rounded the bases. 🇺🇸😤 Colby Thomas destroyed that baseball! #Premier12 || @Premier12 | @USABaseball pic.twitter.com/bHt0Ht9IPT That was no match for Japan’s second baseman Kaito Kozono. Despite hitting just two home runs in 588 PA for the Hiroshima Carp this season, he went supernova on Thursday: Kozono hit a two-run triple in the fifth, a three-run homer in the 7th, and capped it off with a two-run shot in the 8th. That was enough for seemingly unbeatable Japan, who extended its international winning streak to a remarkable 25 games. Its last loss came against the United States in the 2019 Premier12. 🔥🔥🔥 Kaito Kozono is a walking flame! #Premier12 || @Premier12 pic.twitter.com/rn5ttVKLS7 Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Game 3: Chinese Taipei 8, United States 2 In a must-win game between two teams that lost their first super-round games, it was Chinese Taipei whose bats came to play. After threatening in each of the first three innings, Chinese Taipei broke through with two runs in the fourth, another in the fifth, and – with the game still within reach – a five-run seventh inning led by a Kun-Yu Chiang bases-loaded triple. 😤 Chinese Taipei making a statement! #Premier12 pic.twitter.com/A40vBhU5i8 For the USA, Colby Thomas homered for the second consecutive day, though he was lifted after being hit by a pitch in the bottom of the seventh to add a painful end to a rough day for the United States. Though there is technically a possibility of a three-way tie for 1-2 between the U.S., Chinese Taipei, and Venezuela, the United States’ rough performance on the mound means that the tiebreaker rules will almost certainly not break in their favor to reach the gold medal final. ""We are writing our own history story,"" Chinese Taipei manager Hao-Jiu Tseng said after the team's first win against the United States since 2003. ""I also hope that we have two more games. There's an infinite possibility in life. You don't know if you're going to make it, unless you try."" Game 4: Japan 9, Venezuela 6 It wasn’t so much a hush as it was a murmur, an anxious grumble that rolled its way around the Tokyo Dome after Venezuela’s slugging catcher Carlos Pérez hit a two-run home run to give Venezuela the lead in the sixth inning. A few batters later, when Angel Reyes drove in another run to make it 5-3, that grumble turned into outright fear: For the first time in 26 games, a stretch that runs back to 2019, Samurai Japan might lose on the international stage. No one should have been worried. The powerful Japanese bats stormed back in the bottom half of the frame, a bases-loaded walk and a single knotting the game at five. Next up was Shugo Maki, the beloved, dancing slugger who recently helped the Yokohama BayStars win their first Japan Series in 26 years. He took one pitch, a ball. On the next, he lofted a grand slam into the seats and the fans lit up, the decibel levels climbing astronomically. 🔥🔥🔥 ¡¡SHUGO MAKI!!#Premier12 || @Premier12 pic.twitter.com/1pceWYStjd From there, the Samurai Japan pitchers shut the door and the team’s 26th consecutive win was sealed. Japan plays Chinese Taipei tomorrow, but its spot in Sunday’s gold medal game is already assured."
MLB News,Ohtani joins Frank Robinson as 2nd player to win MVP in both leagues,https://www.mlb.com/news/shohei-ohtani-joins-frank-robinson-to-win-al-and-nl-mvp,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:28:00 GMT",,"Bill Ladson Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani added to his legacy Thursday night when he became the second player in baseball history to win the Most Valuable Player Award in both the American and National Leagues, and the first to do so in back-to-back seasons. Ohtani, 30, won the award twice with the Angels -- in 2021 and last year. This year, he found himself in the National League and didn’t miss a beat with the Dodgers, becoming the first player in Major League history with 50 homers and 50 steals in a season. But long before Ohtani put himself in the record books, Frank Robinson was the first to win baseball’s top award in both leagues -- first as a member of the Reds in 1961 and then with the Orioles five years later. That distinction lasted 58 years until Ohtani joined him Thursday. In 1961, Robinson was the No. 1 reason Cincinnati went as far as the World Series before losing to the Yankees in five games. He received 15 of the 16 first-place votes [teammate Joey Jay received the other vote] to win the National League MVP. Robinson led Cincinnati in Wins Above Replacement (7.7, bWAR) and had a slash line of .323/404/.611. Five years later, Cincinnati gave Robinson extra motivation to be the best in baseball. The team traded him to the Orioles for right-hander Milt Pappas and two other players because Robinson, as Reds owner Bill Dewitt put it, “was an old 30.” Robinson ended up making history by winning the Triple Crown and helping the Orioles to their first World Series title. A few weeks later, he was the unanimous MVP in the American League. “Remember, [Robinson] … was as old as Ohtani. Nobody refers to Ohtani as an old 30,” said Baseball Hall of Famer Jim Palmer, who was Robinson’s teammate from 1966-1971. “Frank was an exceptional player. Frank made you think you were going to win. He was a leader, because if he saw something, he was going to say something. … He made everybody better like what M.J. [Michael Jordan] did with the Bulls.” When he was managing the Nationals in 2006, Robinson was surprised that no other Major Leaguer won the MVP in both leagues. He felt with free agency in place starting in 1975, more players would join him in that special category. Mark Langill is the official historian for the Dodgers, and he has a different perspective on why it took 58 years for a player like Ohtani to win the award in both leagues. “I think it’s more luck of the draw in terms of players moving [to another team],” Langill said. “You can have a great season and, like in golf, somebody else could be better than you. It’s not like the batting title. This is an election. This isn’t a stat. It’s not something automatic. “Think about this: In 1924, pitcher Dazzy Vance was the National League MVP. Rogers Hornsby finished second and hit .424. That’s the crazy thing. You have an election and it’s still up to chance. Anything with an election, there is always wiggle room on the result. You can get edged. It’s not like you are leading the league in homers. That’s something you have control over. You don’t have control over an election.” So who could be the next player to win the MVP in both leagues? It very well could be another Dodger -- Mookie Betts won the MVP with the Red Sox in 2018. But since he joined the Dodgers, Betts finished second behind Freddie Freeman in 2020 and Ronald Acuña Jr. three years later. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. “[Betts] can do anything he wants,” said MLB analyst Harold Reynolds. “He can hit home runs. He can steal bases. He can get a man over. He can play short, second base, right field and center field. He is the consummate team player. He has everything. What’s not to like? It’s easy to go in that direction [and pick Betts to win the National League MVP].”"
MLB News,MVP winners in first season with new team,https://www.mlb.com/news/mvp-winners-in-first-season-with-new-team,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:33:00 GMT",,"Sarah Langs Everyone wants to make a strong first impression, and there are few individual accomplishments more impactful than doing so in the form of an MVP Award in a first season after changing teams. Only nine players have won MVP honors in their first year with a new team following a trade, and another six have done so in their first year with a team joined in free agency. Here’s a look at the 15 players to win an MVP Award in their first year with a new team, in reverse chronological order. Note that this list includes players who played in the Majors before joining a new team -- so Ichiro Suzuki, who won in 2001 as a rookie, is not included (Fred Lynn won as a second-year rookie in 1975). 2024: Shohei Ohtani, DodgersAcquired: free agent Ohtani joined the Dodgers on a record 10-year, $700 million contract following six seasons with the Angels, and his signing immediately paid dividends. The two-way superstar was unable to pitch in his first season with the Dodgers after undergoing right elbow surgery the year before, but he made history nonetheless, becoming the first player in MLB history to hit at least 50 home runs (54) and steal at least 50 bases (59) in the same season. That performance earned Ohtani the third MVP Award of his career (all unanimous). It also marked the first time a full-time designated hitter has been named MVP. Not only that, but he helped lead the Dodgers to a World Series title in his first career postseason. 2018: Christian Yelich, BrewersAcquired: traded from MIA The Marlins traded Yelich to the Brewers after the 2017 season, the month after they’d traded reigning NL MVP Giancarlo Stanton to the Yankees. Yelich was on the heels of two straight 4.8 WAR seasons, the top two of his career. But he was even better in ‘18, putting up 7.3 WAR and winning the first batting title in Brewers history en route to MVP honors. He received 29 of 30 first-place votes for the award, winning handily. Yelich had another MVP-worthy campaign in 2019, finishing second to Cody Bellinger after suffering a season-ending injury in early September. 2015: Josh Donaldson, Blue JaysAcquired: traded from OAKDonaldson received MVP votes in 2013 and ‘14, his first two full seasons in the Majors and what would end up being his final two in Oakland. After a '14 campaign that netted him his first All-Star selection, the A’s traded him to Toronto in the offseason. In 2015, he led the AL with 123 RBIs, knocking 41 homers. Donaldson beat out Mike Trout, who also hit 41 homers, for MVP. Donaldson finished fourth for MVP in his second year in Toronto, and he received down-ballot consideration in 2017. The Blue Jays traded him to the Indians at the waiver deadline in 2018. 2004: Vladimir Guerrero, AngelsAcquired: free agentAfter spending the first eight years of his career with the Expos, Guerrero became a free agent following the 2003 season. At that point, he was already a four-time All-Star and had received MVP votes in each of the prior six seasons. Guerrero got a five-year, $70 million contract with a club option -- a $14 million average annual value that was the largest of any multi-year free-agent contract inked that offseason. In his first season, he hit .337 with 39 homers and 126 RBIs, beating out second-place finisher Gary Sheffield for AL MVP. Guerrero never won a second MVP, but he did receive votes in each of his first five seasons with the Angels. 1993: Barry Bonds, GiantsAcquired: free agentAfter playing the first seven years of his career with the Pirates, winning two MVP Awards, including in 1992, Bonds became a free agent. He signed with the Giants for six years and $43.75 million entering the ‘93 season. The reigning NL MVP made an immediate impact, leading the Majors with 46 homers and a 1.136 OPS to win his second consecutive award. He’s the only player to win the award in consecutive years with two different teams. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Bonds went on to win a record seven MVP Awards, with the remaining four coming consecutively in 2001-04. 1991: Terry Pendleton, BravesAcquired: free agentPendleton played the first seven years of his career with the Cardinals, winning two Gold Gloves and receiving MVP voting consideration once. He had never hit above .286 in any season in which he played at least 100 games when he entered free agency for the 1991 season. He signed a four-year, $10.2 million contract to join the Braves, putting up a career year in his debut. He led the NL in batting average at .319 and had a career-high 22 homers. He beat out Bonds for the MVP Award, getting 12 of 24 first-place votes. Pendleton received MVP votes once more in his career, when he finished second the following season. 1988: Kirk Gibson, DodgersAcquired: free agentGibson played the first nine years of his career with the Tigers, receiving MVP votes in three separate seasons. In the offseason entering 1988, he joined the Dodgers on a three-year, $4.5 million contract. Gibson’s most memorable moment in ‘88 had nothing to do with the regular-season efforts that merited his MVP honors, but the award is yet another part of such a notable debut season for him in Los Angeles. Gibson beat out Darryl Strawberry for NL MVP. Gibson never reached his 1988 numbers again in terms of batting average (.290) or homers (25), but his place is cemented in Dodgers lore for his pinch-hit, walk-off home run in Game 1 of the World Series. 1987: Andre Dawson, CubsAcquired: free agentDawson played the first 11 seasons of his career with the Expos, winning the 1977 NL Rookie of the Year Award and six straight Gold Gloves from 1980-85. After the 1986 season, Dawson became a free agent. Entering the 1987 season, he infamously gave the Cubs a blank contract, and he ended up signing a one-year contract worth up to $650,000. In his second straight contract year, Dawson led the Majors with 49 homers and 137 RBIs, winning NL MVP honors. Dawson went on to sign a three-year contract with the Cubs and was an All Star in each of his first five seasons playing in Chicago, across multiple contracts. 1984: Willie Hernandez, TigersAcquired: traded from PHIHernandez pitched for the Cubs from 1977-83, before he was traded to the Phillies in May ‘83. In the offseason, the Phillies traded him to the Tigers -- just before the season started. Hernandez went on to have a dominant season in relief, pitching in 80 games and recording 32 saves with a 1.92 ERA. He won the AL Cy Young Award, and he beat out Kent Hrbek for the MVP, too. Hernandez was an All-Star in 1985 and ‘86, but he never received BBWAA Award votes again. 1981: Rollie Fingers, BrewersAcquired: traded from STL (after earlier offseason trade from SD)Fingers spent the first nine years of his career with the A’s, before signing with the Padres as a free agent entering the 1977 season. He pitched there through 1980, before the club traded him to the Cardinals in the offseason. Four days later, the Cardinals sent him to the Brewers. In his first season in Milwaukee, Fingers led the AL in saves and had a 1.04 ERA In 47 games. He won the Cy Young Award and tacked on MVP honors, too -- edging out Rickey Henderson. Fingers got MVP consideration again in 1982, though he was not named on any Cy Young ballots, and he did not get votes for any BBWAA Awards after that year. 1972: Dick Allen, White SoxAcquired: traded from LADAllen played the first seven years of his career with the Phillies, winning the 1964 NL Rookie of the Year Award and receiving MVP votes in four straight seasons from 1964-67. The Phillies traded him to the Cardinals after the 1969 season, and the Cardinals sent him to the Dodgers a year later. After a one-year stint in Los Angeles, the Dodgers traded Allen to the White Sox. Playing on his third new team in three seasons, Allen led the AL in homers and RBIs in 1972, winning the MVP Award handily over Joe Rudi. He was an All-Star and received MVP votes in each of his three seasons in Chicago, before the White Sox traded him to the Braves, who eventually sent him back to Philadelphia. 1966: Frank Robinson, OriolesAcquired: traded from CINRobinson played the first 10 years of his career with the Reds, receiving votes for a BBWAA Award in all but one of those seasons. He was Rookie of the Year in 1956 and won MVP honors in 1961. His Hall of Fame path was already well paved. Following the 1965 season, he was traded for the first of three times in his career, when the Reds sent him to Baltimore. Robinson wasted no time in becoming the first, and to this point only, player to win MVP honors in both leagues. In his first year in Baltimore, he led the Majors in homers with 49 and slugging percentage at .637. He won the MVP Award unanimously, outpacing second- and third-place finishers Brooks Robinson and Boog Powell -- both of whom were on his team. Robinson didn’t win another MVP Award, but he finished his career with 586 home runs, 14 All-Star selections and an entire trophy case that led to his induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. 1960: Roger Maris, YankeesAcquired: traded from KCAMaris played the first three years of his career for the Indians and Athletics. He was an All-Star for the A’s in 1959, but he had never hit more than 28 homers or slugged above .464. His first year in the Bronx was a different story. Maris hit 39 homers, drove in 112 runs and led the AL with a .581 slugging percentage. He edged out teammate Mickey Mantle for AL MVP by three vote points, receiving two fewer first-place votes than Mantle did. We all know what happened next -- Maris hit 61 homers in 1961 to break Babe Ruth’s single-season record of 60 in 1927. That performance earned Maris his second consecutive MVP Award, again besting Mantle, and making him the only player to win an MVP Award in each of his first two seasons with a new team. 1947: Bob Elliott, BravesAcquired: traded from PITElliott played the first eight years of his career with the Pirates and was a three-time All-Star and four-time MVP vote-getter for them. After the 1946 season, they traded him to the Braves, where he would go on to play the next five seasons. In his first year in Boston, he hit .317 with 22 homers and 113 RBIs. He won MVP honors over Ewell Blackwell. He got MVP votes the next year, as well, and again in 1950, but he did not win another major award. 1934: Mickey Cochrane, TigersAcquired: traded from PHACochrane played the first nine years of his career in Philadelphia, hitting .321 with 108 homers in more than 1,000 games. After the 1933 season, the A’s traded him to the Tigers. He hit .320 and was an All-Star -- in the second year of the Midsummer Classic. After the season, in the fourth year of the BBWAA MVP Award, Cochrane won -- just barely defeating teammate Charlie Gehringer. Cochrane received MVP consideration once more in his career, in 1935."

You get “MLB’s Traveling Spaceship Show,” a retro-themed program that will showcase long-forgotten and interesting highlights and clips from baseball of yesteryear. The new show, which will be available to stream on MLB.TV on Friday before airing on MLB Network at 11 a.m. ET on Sunday, will be hosted by diehard baseball fan, comedian and writer Sarah Tiana. Tiana is the captain of “the Round Tripper” and will navigate her way through the galaxy of baseball history with Jax, her rambunctious puppet co-pilot. They’ll also have a supercomputer named “B.O.B.” -- voiced by Hall of Fame MLB Network broadcaster Bob Costas -- at their disposal as they travel through space and time. B.O.B. will help Tiana and Jax choose specific cities, ballparks, teams and historically great games to visit. The group will also be aided by “The Collector,” who provides the team with rhyming clues to retrieve baseball memorabilia from their adventurous travels. “I grew up watching baseball in front of a wood stove with a TV antenna the size of a flag pole,” said Tiana, who recently collaborated alongside host Roy Wood Jr. on MLB’s All-MLB Awards Show in Las Vegas. “To be on a show that utilizes nostalgic baseball clips takes me back to all those fantastic, grainy moments. I hope it does the same for everyone else and maybe gives you a few laughs, too. Step aside, Jeter. There’s a new Captain in town (me)!” For its maiden adventure, the Traveling Spaceship Show team will head to Seattle, where the Captain and Jax discuss the best food Seattle has to offer, visit Mariners mascot Mariner Moose and have a chat with Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. As for their game destination, they’ll go back to the legendary Game 5 of the 1995 American League Division Series between the Mariners and Yankees. Junior even gives the Captain and Jax a tip about a specific location to visit at a specific time in the Kingdome -- Section 220 in the bottom of the eighth inning. The team leaves the Emerald City with quite a collection from the game, including baseball cards, a 1995 shirt, player figurines and a mascot plush toy.

Orioles' Double-A affiliate gets a new look,https://www.mlb.com/news/baltimore-orioles-affiliate-changes-name-to-chesapeake-baysox,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:15:00 GMT",,"Benjamin Hill The Bowie Baysox, established as the Baltimore Orioles' Double-A affiliate in 1993, have always referenced Chesapeake Bay in their name. Today, during an unveiling event at Annapolis's Chesapeake Bay Foundation, this connection was made explicit: The Bowie Baysox are now the Chesapeake Baysox. The Baysox have an updated name and a new look, but will continue to operate out of Bowie's Prince George's Stadium. The switch to Chesapeake as the team's geographical signifier reflects the expansion of its fan base. Bowie is located approximately 20 miles west of Chesapeake Bay, with the Chesapeake Bay region including parts of six states as well as Washington, D.C. ""Chesapeake Baysox highlights the sense of pride in the region and a larger family of fans that are now supporting the team,"" said team owner Greg Baroni, CEO of Attain Sports. ""While our new name reflects the broader fan base, we're honored to hold on to the local traditions and spirit of the Bowie name. We like to refer to it as Bowie, the home of the Chesapeake Baysox."" Attain Sports purchased the Baysox prior to the 2022 season and its portfolio also includes a Maryland team one rung below Bowie in the Baltimore system, the High-A Aberdeen IronBirds. The Orioles farm system also includes the Single-A Delmarva Shorebirds and Triple-A Norfolk Tides, in Maryland and Virginia respectively. No other MLB organization has all of its affiliates clustered in such close proximity to the parent club. ""The nice thing about having access to digital data, now we can actually understand who our fans are and where they're coming from,"" Baroni said. ""The 2024 season, for example, we welcomed fans from 378 zip codes all of Maryland's 23 counties. Beyond that, we welcomed fans from 1,733 zip codes, from 42 states."" The Chesapeake Baysox logos were created by Baltimore-based Younts Design, whose clients over the years have included a variety of professional baseball teams (including the Orioles). The new primary logo features a blue crab waving the Maryland state flag, which is affixed to a baseball bat. Separate wordmarks for both Chesapeake and Baysox depict rolling waves, while an alternate ""B"" logo"" also features rolling waves. ""It was intentionally designed to include the things that relate to this region,"" said Baroni. ""The Bay-inspired waves, the audacious crab, the bat. Everything that embraces the region is how Younts and our sports marketing came up with this branding identity."" Friday's unveiling marked the start of a new era for the Baysox, with Baroni hinting at more changes to come. ""The [ballpark] experience is not only going to reflect the new team identity, but also strengthening the fan connection,"" he said. ""Great baseball, affordable family entertainment, deepening our partnerships with the community. Those kind of themes are going to resonate, and [fans] are going to see visual connection with those strategic priorities for us."""
MLB News,Snell has met with these teams (report),https://www.mlb.com/news/blake-snell-rumors,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 13:24:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Blake Snell. Nov. 21: Snell has started meeting with teams (report)After lingering on the market until mid-March in his first try at free agency last offseason, Snell isn’t wasting any time in his second go-round. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), the left-hander has already met with the Red Sox and Dodgers. It’s possible he also met, or will meet, with the Orioles and Blue Jays, per Rosenthal's report. Other clubs could be in the mix for Snell as well. During his Wednesday chat on Bleacher Report, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman mentioned that Yankees and Giants are interested in Snell. (Heyman also tied the Dodgers to Snell.) The left-handed ace spent the 2024 season with the Giants and was one of the best starters in baseball over the second half of the season. Heyman said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if Snell re-signed with the club. ""[Snell] loved San Francisco and he thrived in San Francisco, and if you love San Francisco, there's a good chance you end up in San Francisco,"" Heyman said. The Yankees are focused on bringing Juan Soto back to the Bronx, but if they do so, Heyman said he doesn't think the team will also spend the money necessary to get a pitcher like Snell. Nov. 16: Snell reportedly in talks with Red SoxESPN's Jeff Passan said during Friday's edition of the Baseball Bar-B-Cast podcast that the Red Sox are talking to Snell as well as fellow left-handed ace Max Fried. Last week, MLB.com's Mark Feinsand identified the Red Sox as one of the top suitors for Snell, who is a free agent for the second straight offseason and whose stock on the open market should be higher this year than after he won his second Cy Young Award in 2023. Signing Snell would give Boston two things its rotation didn't have last season: a left-hander and a bona fide No. 1 starter. Nov. 6: How many teams are in on Snell?Following his fantastic second half of the 2024 season, Blake Snell is expected to draw interest from many big-market clubs. MLB.com's Mark Feinsand has listed the Giants, Yankees, Mets, Red Sox, Dodgers, Orioles and Blue Jays among the left-hander's potential suitors. An industry source also told Katie Woo and Will Sammon of The Athletic (subscription required) that the Rangers could be in the mix as well. However, that source added that the extent of interest from Toronto and Texas depends on Snell's price tag. Snell opted out of his two-year, $62 million deal with the Giants last week. Although Snell carried a 9.51 ERA through his first six starts with San Francisco and went on the injured list twice within the season's first three months, he was one of the most dominant starters in the Majors over the final three months. That period included 114 strikeouts over 80 1/3 innings and a .382 opponents' OPS. Of course, Snell is just one year removed from winning the NL Cy Young Award with the Padres, the second of his career. Feinsand wrote that Snell's next contract should exceed $27 million in annual average value -- the AAV of Carlos Rodón's six-year deal with the Yankees that he signed prior to the 2023 season. However, Snell's deal might come with fewer guaranteed years since he is entering his age-32 campaign. Rodón was 30 when he joined the Yanks."
MLB News,Are Cubs looking to trade this former MVP?,https://www.mlb.com/news/cubs-rumors-latest-trades-and-signings,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 14:35:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of all the latest Cubs-related free agent and trade rumors right here. Nov. 21: Cubs want to trade Bellinger (report)Although outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger exercised his player option for 2025, it’s not a guarantee that he’ll be with the Cubs on Opening Day. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), rival executives say that the Cubs want to trade the 29-year-old. Bellinger’s contract -- he’s owed $27.5 million in 2025 and can earn $25 million in 2026 by picking up his player option -- could limit the return for the Cubs. But if they are truly motivated to move him, they should be able to find a suitor. Bellinger’s production regressed in 2024, but he still had a solid 111 OPS+. He has also proven capable of handling center field, a weak position in this year’s free-agent market. Rosenthal mentions the Yankees as a possible fit for Bellinger if they aren’t able to re-sign Juan Soto, noting that the Bronx Bombers have shown interest in Bellinger in the past. Bellinger could potentially be a backup option for some of the other teams involved in the Soto sweepstakes as well. Trading Bellinger would add more payroll flexibility for the Cubs to address their top priority this offseason, which is pitching. But while Chicago’s interest in adding a starter is clear, there have been conflicting reports about which arms the team might target. On Wednesday, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman mentioned the Cubs among the teams in the mix to sign one of the three aces currently available via free agency: Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried. However, The Athletic's (subscription required) Sahadev Sharma reports that the Cubs have “ruled out” that tier of free-agent hurlers and could also stay away from other pitchers who declined a qualifying offer, including Sean Manaea, Luis Severino and Nick Pivetta. Sharma mentions Yusei Kikuchi, Nathan Eovaldi and Jack Flaherty as possible options. Nov. 20: Cubs acquire Morgan and Thaiss, DFA WisdomThe Cubs acquired reliever Eli Morgan from the Guardians in exchange for outfield prospect Alfonsin Rosario (No. 21 on Pipeline’s Top 30 list for the Cubs) on Wednesday. The Cubs also shored up their catching depth on Wednesday, acquiring Matt Thaiss from the Angels. To clear room on the 40-man roster for their new acquisitions, Chicago designated Patrick Wisdom and Trey Wingenter for assignment."
MLB News,"SoxFest Live returns in 2025 with new name, location and fan-friendly format",https://www.mlb.com/news/soxfest-live-returns-for-2025,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:49:05 GMT",Meet-and-greets and other events scheduled for Ramova Theatre on Jan. 24-25,"Scott Merkin CHICAGO -- SoxFest is returning for White Sox fans, but with a different name and a different format. The freshly dubbed SoxFest Live is scheduled to take place on Friday and Saturday, January 24-25, at the historic Ramova Theatre in Chicago’s Bridgeport neighborhood, located a half mile from Guaranteed Rate Field. The event will run from 5-9 p.m. CT on both nights. The White Sox held a season-ticket holder only event at the Field Museum last offseason, but this is the first SoxFest open to everyone since January 2020 at McCormick Place. “We were excited to bring it back and introduce a new concept,” White Sox senior director of public relations Sheena Quinn told MLB.com of the event’s return and reconfiguration. “When we were talking about the idea of SoxFest, we were like, ‘Let’s do it in a different way, let’s reimagine it.’ Let’s think of an experience that’s really going to give a way to connect with the White Sox organization, especially after such a difficult year.' ""We want to offer something to the fans that is going to feel different and feel something like they are totally immersed into the experience.” Friday and Saturday general admission tickets are $56, with a limited number of premium tickets for the MVP Experience at $225. That MVP Experience includes early entry to view the exclusive White Sox Black Carpet welcoming the attendees ahead of the event, access to a premium lounge area and private meet and greet session on the balcony, light food and beverage, as well as four lower-level tickets to a select 2025 White Sox home game (restrictions apply). There also will be a SoxFest Live After Party available to purchase, with the one-hour reception alongside White Sox VIPs immediately following the show. White Sox season ticket holders will have access to an exclusive SoxFest Live presale, offering specially priced tickets beginning on Tuesday, Nov. 26, at 9 a.m. CT, while supplies last. Additional information about SoxFest Live can be found at whitesox.com/SoxFestLive. So, how does SoxFest Live differ from past SoxFest experiences? The capacity will be smaller, moving from an exhibit hall floorplan to a theatre floorplan. “There will be meet-and-greets, but it’s not going to be your typical traditional autograph table setup. It’s not like scheduled autograph times,” Quinn said. “It’s more about the programming on stage and then the meet-and-greet happening throughout the theater, throughout the evening. “Meet-and greet-experiences will feel different, but it will be about meeting the players you cheer for who are wearing the uniform, or the former players and the greats they have cheered for in the past. You can take photos and get stuff signed, but it’s going to be more about meeting people. It will be different. It will be fun.” The lineup is not set, but the focus will fall upon the current White Sox roster, coaching staff and front office members, while also bringing in individuals from the 2005 World Series champions and other eras. The White Sox will celebrate the 20th anniversary of that momentous title and the 125th anniversary of the franchise during the ’25 season. Getting to know the best spots ✍️ pic.twitter.com/igWneGTu8Y General manager Chris Getz and manager Will Venable will be present and taking fans’ questions. This will be Venable’s first chance to address the fans directly, and the same for Getz as general manager. “Part of the whole program is to be able to have those conversations again,” Quinn said. “The whole purpose is to be able to connect the fans to ask the questions directly to our leadership. “It’s going to be a really good opportunity for Chris and Will to be there and set the tone for what they feel is the vision for 2025 and beyond. That’s a really important point for them to communicate to fans who want to know, ‘What’s the future of the White Sox?’” To connect to White Sox fans of all ages, a Kids Camp is set for Jan. 25 at 2 p.m. CT at the Chicago Park District’s ComEd Rec Center near Pilsen. Registration is $35 and opens Tuesday with the SoxFest Live ticket sales. “The whole purpose of a winter fan event is to unofficially start the season, get ready for Spring Training, the start of the regular season and also connect people with the members of that season’s clubhouse,” Quinn said. “So, it’s a fun, engaging way to get things going.”"
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","If Army upsets Notre Dame, it could upend the entire playoff structure",https://sports.yahoo.com/how-an-army-win-over-notre-dame-could-upset-the-cfp-this-year-and-in-years-to-come-183352334.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:33:52 GMT",Army is 9-0 despite not being able to take advantage of NIL and the transfer portal. Saturday's showdown at Yankee Stadium has major CFP ramifications.,"History hangs heavy over this weekend’s massive Army-Notre Dame showdown. Once upon a time, this was the most famous rivalry in the land, a war that bewitched the entire country. Americans waited anxiously for newspapers, gathered around radios, stared into the glow of massive early television sets to learn which of these titans would claim the year’s finest, most important game. Army-Notre Dame inspired both the greatest lede in the history of sports journalism — Grantland Rice’s “Outlined against a blue-gray October sky, the Four Horsemen rode again” — and the greatest pregame speech in sports history, Knute Rockne’s “Win one for the Gipper” plea. It’s the wellspring of sports as myth, of coaches as stern but loving father figures and players as doomed or exalted heroes. So it’s somehow perfect, narratively speaking, that this rivalry, which has fallen so far from its 20th-century heights, could once again alter the trajectory of an entire sport. The business of college football today would be unrecognizable to Rockne, Red Blaik, Ara Parseghian and other legends of the Notre Dame-Army rivalry, but the primary focus — size up that man on the other side of the line, beat him and let the cards fall where they may — would be warmly familiar. Army and Notre Dame claimed 16 national championships in the 20th century, including seven in the 1940s alone (technically six, since they share 1946). They’ve fallen far since then; Army’s last title season was in 1946, and Notre Dame’s was in 1988. The Irish have fought their way back to prominence since then, using limitless resources, a de facto personal broadcast network and a nationwide recruiting footprint. The far more interesting transformation is happening in West Point, where Army is in the midst of making history on multiple fronts. The 9-0 Black Knights are one win away from just the fourth double-digit win in the entire 131-year history of the program. You have to go all the way back to 1958 to find Army’s last undefeated season. Aside from one seven-year stint in Conference USA around the turn of the millennium, Army has been a proud Independent until this year, when it stomped into the AAC and took control of the joint. The miracle here is how Army has put itself into this position despite not being able to take advantage of college football’s two earth-shattering weapons: NIL and the transfer portal. The Army doesn’t permit its players to take NIL money, and one doesn’t just parachute into West Point for a single mercenary season. But it’s not hard to see how Army’s old-school ethos is a counterintuitive benefit. While other AAC schools were getting raided for their best talent, or trying to slap together a crew of one-off bounty hunters, Army is building a team. (Yes, this sounds like a commercial. That doesn’t make it any less true.) Quarterback Bryson Daily, for instance, played exactly one game as a freshman and didn’t throw a pass. He played five as a sophomore, and scored two touchdowns on 12 rushing attempts. He took over the starting job as a junior, and now, as a senior, leads all FBS quarterbacks in rushing yards and ranks second in rushing touchdowns with 21. That’s the kind of wait-your-turn, be-ready-when-called mindset that the portal and NIL have already devastated across the country. As Florida State has demonstrated to chilling effect, it’s not enough to bring in a bunch of starred recruits, toss them a ball and expect them to win games. Team cohesion helps, too, the kind of cohesion you get from living, eating, practicing and bleeding together for three or four seasons. NIL can paper over a lot of college football’s sins, but it can’t replace that. Army beats its opponents by grinding them into dust, holding the ball for massive chunks of the game and using opportunistic turnovers and a conservative, ball-control offense to own the tempo. It’s a way to defeat a physically superior opponent; stay in the conversation long enough and you can take control of it … both in the game and in the season. Granted, despite its unblemished record, Army’s strength of schedule is a real concern. The Black Knights rank 19th in the current CFP standings, behind a raft of one-, two- and three-loss teams. The SEC and Big Ten can squabble about who’s the better conference; no such debates exist with the AAC. That’s what makes this weekend’s Notre Dame rematch so compelling, and so crucial. Army now has the chance to upend the entire playoff structure. All it has to do is overcome a projected 14.5-point spread and break a 15-game losing streak that dates back to 1958. But if Army can manage that, everything opens up — a new Group of Five team works its way into the playoff conversation, and the Irish are either out of the mix entirely or trying to justify their way in over a fellow two-loss SEC squad. And once the playoff begins, who knows what could happen next? We’re in uncharted territory here. Sure, Army-Notre Dame might not ever return to its glory days when it determined the fate of the college football universe. But it’s back to being a crucial, must-watch matchup, and that’s one of so many elements of this season that’s worth celebrating."

The memo informed teams and players that the FBI has connected recent high-profile burglaries to ""transnational South American theft groups,"" warning that these groups are ""reportedly well-organized, sophisticated rings that incorporate advanced techniques and technologies, including pre-surveillance, drones and signal-jamming devices,"" according to the Associated Press. Portis revealed that ""several prized possessions"" were taken from his home and believed he was targeted because the burglary occurred while the Bucks' Nov. 2 game with the Cleveland Cavaliers tipped off, ESPN's Jamal Collier reported.

The Portis burglary showed ""similarities"" to recent break-ins at the homes of Kansas City Chiefs stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, according to River Hills, Wisconsin, police chief Michael Gaynor. This week, the NFL issued a security alert to teams and the players union warning that professional athletes across multiple sports and states were being ""increasingly targeted for burglaries by organized and skilled groups"" after being briefed by the FBI on these incidents, ABC News reported. ""Some of the burglary groups have conducted extensive surveillance on targets, including attempted home deliveries and posing as grounds maintenance or joggers in the neighborhood. ""Burglars have entered through side doors, via balconies or through second-floor windows. They've targeted homes in secluded areas and focused on master bedrooms and closet areas."" NBA teams and players were informed in the league memo that theft rings were ""primarily focused on cash and items that can be resold on the black market, such as jewelry, watches and luxury bags."" Kelce reportedly had $20,000 stolen from his home. Among the measures recommended by the NBA to its players were installing updated alarm systems with cameras and putting them in use whenever leaving their homes, keeping valuables locked and secured in safes, removing online real estate listings that show interior photos of a residence, and employing protective guard services during extended absences from home."

At the time both were drafted, they appeared to be core players that the team would build around. However, circumstances didn't follow that path. Barkley left the Giants as a free agent, signing with the NFC East rival Philadelphia Eagles last spring. In his first season with Philadelphia, he's rushed for 1,137 yards and eight touchdowns in 10 games, on track to post his best NFL season. Now, Jones' career with the Giants is over after he was released on Friday. The quarterback was benched in favor of Tommy DeVito and unlikely to play in the team's remaining seven games. Under that scenario, Jones asked to be let go. It's hardly the ending Giants fans envisioned for Jones after he was the team's first-round selection (No. 6 overall) in the 2019 NFL Draft. But if anyone would know how it feels to move on from the Giants after being a top draft pick, it's Barkley (No. 2 overall in 2018). Considering their similar histories with the Giants and being teammates for five seasons, it was natural to ask Barkley for his thoughts on Jones being released. Reporters covering the Eagles did just that on Friday. Saquon Barkley gives his thoughts on the Giants releasing Daniel Jones, his good friend. pic.twitter.com/TOwW03p2s0 — Tim McManus (@Tim_McManus) November 22, 2024 ""I've been in contact with him. Our friendship has stayed close throughout the whole process of me being here,"" Barkley responded. ""It sucks to see how everything went down for him over there. I've got nothing but great things to say about him. You're not going to find anybody that can say negative things about him. ""It's the NFL. Hopefully, wherever he ends up next, they're going to get a guy to come in and work,"" he added. ""It didn't work for me over there, and I'm doing well over here. Hopefully, he can find the same fresh start and success."" Jones is unlikely to get that fresh start in a reunion with Barkley in Philadelphia. But after he clears waivers, many teams could be interested in Jones as a bridge for a team with a young quarterback or looking to draft one, according to Yahoo Sports' Jori Epstein."

Hubbard has been one of fantasy’s best draft picks this season, but he gets the league’s toughest run defense this week. The Chiefs have allowed the league’s fewest touches (20.9), rushing yards (52.2) and fantasy points (12.8) to running backs. No RB has reached 60 rushing yards against Kansas City this season. Rookie Jonathon Brooks is set to make his NFL debut Sunday and will take away some touches, and the Panthers have a league-low 16.5-point implied team total. Hubbard admittedly may be needed this week with six byes, but expectations need to be tempered. Darnold posted an 8.4 YPA with a 12:5 TD:INT ratio over his first six games this season, but he has a 7.5 YPA with a 5:5 ratio over four games since LT Christian Darrisaw went down. Darnold has had a favorable schedule over the last month, but he gets a tough, slow-paced matchup outdoors in Chicago this week. The Bears are a run-funnel defense allowing the seventh-most EPA/rush but the second-fewest EPA/pass. Chicago has yielded the fewest fantasy points to quarterbacks and an NFL-low seven passing scores this season. Start Rome Odunze, who leads Chicago in target share (23%), catches (17), yards (233), yards per route run (1.77) and 1D/RR over four games since its bye. He gets a pass-funnel Vikings’ defense allowing the second-fewest fantasy points to RBs but the third-most to WRs. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Ridley’s fantasy day would’ve looked a lot better last week had his 51-yard touchdown not been negated by an illegal formation penalty. He’s finished top three in air yards in back-to-back weeks since Will Levis returned. In fact, Ridley leads the league in air yards, and he’s been fantasy’s WR8 over four games since DeAndre Hopkins was traded. Ridley should continue to see good volume this week against a Houston defense that’s stout against the run but ceding the eighth-most fantasy points to wide receivers. Goff has 19 touchdown passes over the last eight games, and his 9.2 YPA leads the NFL. If you’re into coverage schemes (h/t TruMedia), it may be worth noting that Goff has especially shredded man coverage this season, leading the NFL in YPA (11.9) and Passer Rating (154.3). All eight of Goff’s interceptions have come against zone coverage, which the Colts have used at the league’s second-highest rate (79.6%). Still, Goff has remained plenty productive against zone as well, getting 8.9 YPA with the third-most TD passes (nine). Goff gets a fast-paced matchup indoors, and the Lions have a league-high 30.5-point implied team total, so he should remain in fantasy lineups. Waddle is seemingly due for a breakout game any week now, but he’s averaged just 3.3 catches, 51.3 receiving yards and 0.2 TDs over six games with Tua Tagovailoa this season. He’d be fantasy’s WR49 for the season over that span (7.9 fantasy points per game). Waddle ranks 65th in fantasy points per route run this year. The Dolphins have a healthy projected total (27.5 points), and Christian Gonzalez figures to shadow Tyreek Hill. However, Waddle has a lowly 16.2% air yards share, a 0.14 TPRR and a 0.28 XFP/RR versus man coverage this season, which New England has used at the league’s third highest rate (40.6%). The Patriots are also one of the few teams that didn’t utilize two-high heavily against the Dolphins last season, and Waddle has seen a -25.7% FP/RR reduction versus single-high since last season. This might be a monster week for Hill. Mike Evans is set to return this week but expect White and Irving to lead Tampa Bay’s offense. Since Week 6, Irving has been fantasy’s RB23 (points per game), and White has been the RB8. The Buccaneers are six-point home favorites (with a 24.5-point implied team total) coming out of their bye against a Giants franchise starting Tommy DeVito for financial reasons, so game script should be favorable. New York has been gashed for the league’s highest EPA/rush over the last month, and the Giants have allowed the most schedule-adjusted rushing fantasy points to RBs over the last five games. They’ve ceded an NFL-high 5.3 YPC this season. There’s some concern Sean Tucker also gets more involved, but he’s been a complete afterthought since his big game in Week 6. Both Irving and White can be started with confidence this week. Robinson saw 17 opportunities during his return last week, including a goal-line score. He ranks top 10 in rushing TDs (seven) this season despite missing three games thanks to heavy red zone work. Robinson is off the injury report this week, so hopefully he’s closer to 100%. The Cowboys have been gashed for NFL-highs in EPA/rush and rushing touchdowns while allowing the third-most fantasy points to running backs. Washington has this week’s second highest implied team total (28.5 points) and are double-digit home favorites against a reeling Cowboys team, so game-script should be highly favorable. Robinson has averaged 5.5 YPC at home this season and is a strong fantasy start this week. Nix ranks fourth in fantasy points per game and third in catchable throw rate since Week 5. He’s the QB4 in expected fantasy points on the season, and Nix barely threw downfield earlier in the year. Moreover, the Broncos suddenly ran motion during 60% of their dropbacks last week after entering last in motion usage; Nix went 17-of-19 for 230 yards (12.1 YPA) with a 4:0 TD:INT ratio during those plays. He gets a matchup indoors this week against a Raiders’ defense allowing the eighth-most fantasy points to QBs and dealing with multiple injuries in their secondary. Nate Hobbs, Jack Jones and Jakorian Bennett haven’t practiced through Thursday this week, so Las Vegas may be down three starting corners. Nix looks like a top-five fantasy QB once again this week. Jennings has averaged 119.7 receiving yards and 29.3 FPG over three games without either Brandon AIyuk or Deebo Samuel Sr.; both marks would lead the NFL this season. His 42% first-read target rate over that span would rank second in the league this year. Jennings has averaged more fantasy points per route run than Justin Jefferson this season, and he ranks top five in 1D/RR. We are getting the 2023 version of Aiyuk from Jennings, who’s replaced BA in San Francisco’s “X” role. Green Bay will be missing corner Jaire Alexander, and Samuel Sr. simply hasn’t looked the same while recovering from pneumonia. Brock Purdy is out with a shoulder injury, which means Brandon Allen gets the start in Week 12. It’s a definite downgrade for Jennings, who’s now more like a top-30 WR this week. Harrison Jr. started to finally run more crossing routes before Arizona’s bye, and hopefully, MHJ gets the proverbial rookie bump coming out of it. Harrison Jr. ranks seventh in air yards share (41.1%) and eighth in end-zone targets — tied with Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb. Harrison Jr. has faced the league’s fifth-toughest WR schedule up until now (his QB has faced the toughest), but the rookie wideout gets the fourth easiest moving forward. Harrison Jr. has produced the second-most fantasy points per route run against press this season, which Seattle has used at the league’s fifth-highest rate. The Seahawks have also allowed the fifth-most fantasy points over expected to WRs this season. Kyler Murray got 9.1 YPA over his last three games before Arizona’s bye against three top pass defenses, so the Cardinals’ offense has upside. Harrison Jr. is a top 15 WR in this fast-paced matchup. Stafford has averaged 296.4 passing yards, 2.2 TDs and 19.0 fantasy points (~QB7) in games with Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua this season; he’s averaged 215.0 passing yards, 0.4 TDs and 8.9 fantasy points (~QB40) without them (h/t FTN). And Nacua was ejected from one of those games early. Stafford is also due for further touchdown regression, as he leads the league in end-zone targets (33) but is tied for just 12th in TD passes. That said, fantasy managers should at least explore alternatives this week with the Rams facing an Eagles’ defense that’s allowed a 2:5 TD:INT ratio since Week 4. A league-low 18.7% of the passing plays against Philadelphia have gained 10+ yards over that span. The Eagles have allowed just one wide receiver (Ja’Marr Chase) to rank higher than the WR40 in weekly scoring since Week 4. Philadelphia has ceded an NFL-low 19.3 yards per drive over the last two months. A shootout is possible here, but Stafford is up against the league’s hottest defense. Gus Edwards has taken 30% of the rush attempts since returning, while Hassan Haskins has stolen 46% of the attempts inside the five-yard line. Dobbins will retain fantasy value with a still healthy role in a good offense, but he’s averaged just 3.7 YPC since Week 2 and gets a difficult matchup Monday night. The Ravens have allowed the second-fewest RB rushing yards per game (61.1) and an NFL low 3.4 YPC this season. Baltimore has been vulnerable to receiving backs, but Dobbins has averaged just 2.0 targets this month. Fantasy managers may be unable to sit Dobbins with so many byes this week, but his expectations should be lowered. Start Quentin Johnston, who led Chargers’ WRs in snap share (81%) and had career highs in targets (eight) and air yards (165) last week. He’s been a busted coverage merchant at times, but Johnston also has the fourth-most receiving touchdowns (six) among all pass catchers this season. Ravens’ opponents have averaged by far the most pass attempts (39.5) this year, so Johnston is a top-25 WR this week."

As such, I’m going to break down each game on the slate into three categories: Binge, Stream and Skip. Games you want to “binge” are like the show you can’t miss; you’re watching as soon as it goes live and might just crush all the episodes in one weekend. These are the start-all-your-guys fantasy games and ones with season-defining storylines. Games you want to “stream” are like the shows you certainly watch start to finish, but perhaps you’re finishing it over time instead of one shot. While these games might not feature a ton of “must-starts,” we can pick and choose our spots, and the teams are likely to matter in the NFL playoff picture. Lastly, the games you want to “skip” are like the shows you’re leaning toward passing on, but you might catch an episode here and there (or might stick to reading recaps online to stay up with the culture). There will be a non-obvious player or two who stands out in these games, but overall, they aren’t the best environment for fantasy football. Let’s dive into my Week 12 Fantasy Football Viewer’s Guide. We are looking at a significant referendum game on Sunday Night Football between two NFC teams, particularly when the Rams have the ball. The Eagles defense is No. 1 in EPA per play and success rate allowed since they returned from a Week 5 bye. They’ve received so many excellent performances from young players at all three levels. Linebacker Nakobe Dean has stabilized a long-problematic position on the Eagles defense and has formed a strong tandem with standout Zack Baun. On the front line, Jalen Carter has looked like one of the premier interior rushers in football of late. He single-handily wrecked Washington’s offense last Thursday night. Even more critical may be the play of two rookies in the secondary. Right corner Quinyon Mitchell has been a premier coverage player on the outside. He’s played lock-down man coverage and rarely gets caught in zone. Mitchell will get a tough challenge in Puka Nacua, whom I think looks like a leveled-up player this year when playing the ball in tight coverage. All the motion the Rams throw at opponents makes it challenging for one player to cover Nacua a majority of his routes. That could make this a bigger challenge for Mitchell than some of the other receivers he’s locked down this season. Per PFF, Cooper DeJean has taken 277 of 443 snaps this year as the slot corner. It’s hard to say what's been more impressive about DeJean: his tackling, or coverage from the slot. Both skills will be needed against Cooper Kupp in Week 12. Kupp isn’t the same player from his 2021 season but he still reads zone coverage extremely well and is as reliable as any receiver. The way he works on option routes makes him a chore to cover. DeJean will need to bring his A-game. For all the good players the Eagles have in coverage and some of the advantages the Rams bring to the table in the receiver room, this game will be won and lost up front. According to Next Gen Stats, Philadelphia has recorded the fourth-fastest average time to pressure (2.56 seconds) this season and has converted 24.8% of their pressures into sacks, the second-highest rate in the NFL. The Rams have allowed pressure in 2.51 seconds on average in 2024, the fastest in the league. If the Rams can’t block it up, this game could turn troubling quickly. Matthew Stafford’s 54.1 passer rating under pressure is among the lowest in football this season — that's the same territory as Will Levis and Caleb Willams; not ideal company. If Carter and co. take over the game up front, they can win this game. On the other side, the Rams defense has stepped up on the front line. Their young pass rushers make this defense tough to play against and they rank third in rushing success rate allowed since Week 8. Stopping Saquon Barkley will be priority No. 1 and that pass rush has to win early and often. For all the good play up front, the secondary still has its holes. The Rams defense can’t allow A.J. Brown to run loose down the field. If he hits those trademark big plays and the Eagles get ahead on the scoreboard, their pass rush will be in a position to take over the game. The vaunted Ravens offense stumbled last week against a difficult defense in the Pittsburgh Steelers. They won’t find a soft landing spot in Week 12 with a matchup against the Chargers. Los Angeles has been one of the most fundamentally sound defenses in the NFL. The Chargers are the fourth-bet run defense this season by rushing EPA allowed but play with some of the lightest boxes among any stop unit. You have to wonder if they change that approach with Derrick Henry and Lamar Jackson coming to town. If they don’t bring extra men into the box and stick with their usual defensive approach, the Chargers operate with two-high safeties more than almost any other unit. When Lamar Jackson faces two high defenses, he looks to push the ball downfield. Despite being the vertical X-receiver, Rashod Bateman leads the main pass-catchers with 2.79 yards per route run vs. two-high, per Fantasy Points Data. The Chargers plan of attack against Baltimore is more straightforward to map. An offense that’s been inclined to chuck it and rip the ball downfield more than almost any other unit in recent weeks should keep it rolling. The Ravens defense has been bleeding passing production all year and ranks 28th in EPA per dropback allowed. Some of their biggest issues have actually come from former All-Pro linebacker Roquan Smith, who is on the injury report this week and hasn’t played well, regardless. Smith has had issues in coverage and communication errors over the middle have haunted this defense. If the Ravens can’t defend the middle of the field, that’s an issue against the Chargers. Justin Herbert has been ultra-aggressive when ripping it in the intermediate area of the field. His two most consistent pass-catchers are Ladd McConkey and Will Dissly. The big-play slot receiver and tight end run their routes right in the sectors Baltimore has struggled to cover this season. The Cardinals come off of their bye-week to big expectations. Not only are they the No. 1 team in the NFC West through 11 weeks, but they are the top-ranked offense in EPA per play and success rate since Week 8. This scoring unit has become everything that Cardinals optimists believed they could be. Arizona has a settled offensive identity. It's a power-run team that plays an old-school style of football with heavy personnel. I don’t think we’ll see schematic changes post-bye. The two players to watch are the rookie skill-position players and their deployment. Trey Benson played on 28% and 27% of the snaps in the two weeks before the bye, a marked increase from previous contests. He also touched the ball 21 times and was effective with the ball in his hands. Benson isn’t going to unseat James Conner but adding his explosiveness would be a good change of pace. Impactful touches from Benson would go a long way to establishing his case as one of the top backup running back bench-stashes in fantasy. Marvin Harrison Jr.’s usage has much more fantasy utility. It’s not a coincidence that Arizona’s ascension to the top of the league charts offensively overlapped with tweaks in Harrison’s deployment. The Cardinals finally started to mix up the route tree Marvin Harrison Jr., as I detailed in the #ReceptionPerception Rookie Report. That's going to set him up for some nice performances coming out of the bye week. pic.twitter.com/3SmgtKji34 — Matt Harmon (@MattHarmon_BYB) November 21, 2024 The passing game is just more dangerous and consistent with Harrison running more of those intermediate routes. Kyler Murray and Harrison have developed strong chemistry on those digs and outs. If Harrison continues to see targets on those routes, he’ll become a more stable weekly bet. The Seahawks come into this game off a big win over the 49ers. Seattle is now jumbled at 5-5 with San Francisco and Los Angeles in the NFC West, so this is a critical game. Seattle still feels like a team operating under a first-year coaching staff. We’re seeing tweaks on both sides of the ball as Mike MacDonald and Ryan Grubb try to settle their units. Offensively, the biggest change in recent weeks has been the role of Jaxon Smith-Njigba. We've seen what I'll call more intentional usage for Jaxon Smith-Njigba in recent games. The fact that we got that type of deployment once again coming out of the bye and with DK Metcalf back in the lineup feels like a big deal. pic.twitter.com/p9krXPTymV — Matt Harmon (@MattHarmon_BYB) November 18, 2024 Getting a 100-yard performance with DK Metcalf in the lineup was a big deal. JSN’s 9.4 air yards per target wasn’t at the level of his outlier 17.5 from Week 9 but it still marks a change. The targets for JSN felt more intentional than in previous weeks, where he was simply a dump-off option. The second-year receiver worked in combo routes alongside Metcalf — which weaponized both players — and saw a bump in his targets on third down. That’s how you get the most out of this talented receiver. Most important 49ers storyline: The 49ers offense just lacks teeth. Their success rate and EPA metrics are still high but, without Brandon Aiyuk, peak Deebo Samuel Sr. or a fully healthy Christian McCaffrey, this unit doesn’t feel as dangerous as it once did. The plays to Jauan Jennings have been absurdly efficient but even he doesn’t offer verticality. The 49ers have to be a mistake-free, efficiency-based unit more than ever. With Brock Purdy out for this game with a shoulder injury, that just adds another layer of difficulty to a unit already finding life more challenging than usual. Most important Packers storyline: Green Bay ranked 27 out of 28 teams in neutral pass rate in Week 11. In conjunction, we saw the big receivers like Romeo Doubs and Christian Watson get a playing time bump. Watson ran a route on 70% of the dropbacks, which was his highest route participation of the season. The second tight end, Blake Sims, also saw the field more than usual. The Packers made a concerted effort to get their heavier personnel on the field and establish the run. It’s worth wondering if this is a one-week blip because of the matchup or a sign of things to come. It worked against Chicago as the Packers had the fourth-best dropback success rate and ninth-best rushing success rate among Week 11 offenses. Green Bay always leans more run-heavy than most think and any greater tilt toward the ground game would make it even more difficult to project their constantly rotating pass-catchers. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Most important Vikings storyline: The Vikings have started to back off Aaron Jones in recent weeks. He started off the season as one of the most effective rushers in the league this September but that’s not been the case of late. Jones played a whopping 92% of the snaps in Week 8 and his touches have gone down every week since. We even saw Cam Akers handle 10 rushes last week. It might not be the worst idea to keep Jones fresh by allowing Akers to take some of the grinder carries off his plate. If Jones can regain some of that explosive ability, he has a nice matchup this week. The Bears rank 23rd in rushing EPA allowed since Week 8 and have been particularly vulnerable off the edge. Jones has long been one of the premier outside runners in the game. Most important Bears storyline: You never see a playbook get a full overhaul when a team changes coordinators mid-season. You’re too far downstream to install a whole new playbook. However, you can see a new voice added a few wrinkles. Several changes were added to the Bears offensive approach that fit this variety. The first was DJ Moore’s role, which focused more on getting him in space and taking off some of the burden of downfield, low-percentage routes. There was a sizable shift in the way Thomas Brown used DJ Moore in his first game as the Bears' OC: Moore in Week 11: an average depth of target of just 0.86 yards with 56 yards after the catchMoore in Weeks 1-10: an average depth of target over 8.3 yards and 176 yards after… — Field Yates (@FieldYates) November 20, 2024 Getting the ball out of Caleb Williams’ hands was a priority, as was giving him the freedom to take off if routes weren’t open quickly. Williams added 4.63 EPA on scrambles in Week 11, the second-most among quarterbacks. Geno Smith ranked No. 1 and that’s due to running in the game-winning touchdown. We still have a long way to go with the Bears offense approaching full viability but getting Moore involved on YAC-based routes, allowing Williams to be used as a rusher and getting Rome Odunze more first-read targets will help. We saw all three in Week 11. Most important Lions storyline: Over the last two weeks, Jameson Williams has a mere 17.5% target share but has been earning the high-yield looks. His 18.9 average depth of target is the third-highest among pass-catchers with double-digit targets in that span. Williams is squarely in the role that lifts the roof off of the offense. The Colts' pass defense plays simple coverages and makes mistakes on the back end. He’s never the safest play on the board but with so many receivers on bye in Week 12, this looks like a spot to chase Williams' ceiling. Most important Colts storyline: Week 11 was without a doubt the best game of Anthony Richardson’s career. He was effective as a chain-mover and downfield passer. Josh Downs snaring an early vertical shot from the slot seemed to settle the whole offense and his young quarterback down. Those two guys have an underrated connection and it’s just not been discussed enough how little time they have playing together. The last two games with Richardson starting have been some of Downs’ best as a pro. He’s in line for another big outing in Week 12 against a Lions defense that’s really turned the corner but has a clear interior weakness. Detroit allows the most yards per game to slot receivers this season. Most important Chiefs storyline: As it turns out, the Chiefs will not get Isiah Pacheco back in time for this game and a matchup with a Panthers' run defense that’s been among the worst in the NFL. From a success rate standpoint, the Chiefs' run game has been a top-five attack with Kareem Hunt as the lead back. However, anyone with eyeballs can see Hunt has left a lot of big plays on the table due to a lack of juice. His 1.4% explosive rushing rate is the lowest among backs with 100-plus carries. When he’s healthy, Pacheco's big-play ability will make a difference on just a handful of touches in tandem with Hunt. This offense needs someone to create the explosives they aren’t getting through the air. A healthy dose of Hunt should be enough to beat the Panthers but they need Pacheco back sooner than later to weaponize this run game. Most important Panthers storyline: The Panthers will get two big players back on offense this week. In the passing game, veteran receiver Adam Thielen will get back from a stint on IR. Thielen was starting as the big slot receiver for this team in the last two seasons, but rookie Jalen Coker has given them quality reps in that position. It would be odd for a team in the Panthers’ position to take a developing rookie off the field. Whoever takes the majority of the reps in the slot has a great matchup, as Kansas City allows more production to slot receivers than almost any other defense. Rookie running back Jonathon Brooks will likely make his season debut. This will be Brooks’ first NFL action, so it would be a huge surprise if he takes a big slice of the pie away from Chuba Hubbard, who has been one of the most efficient backs in the league this season. Most important Buccaneers storyline: Mike Evans will suit up for the Buccaneers for the first time since Week 8. That Ravens loss feels like a whole different lifetime for this Bucs team. In the three games since, Cade Otton leads the team with 29 targets; running backs Rachaad White and Bucky Irving are second and third. You just don’t see many offenses that get such little output from the wide receiver position. Otton should be able to remain in his role as the power slot replacement for Chris Godwin. He’s been getting the tight coverage targets over the middle and the screen looks. Evans will immediately walk into a completely vacant role as the top perimeter pass-catcher and vertical threat. He has a chance to be a WR1 in fantasy with Baker Mayfield playing as well as he has this season. Most important Giants storyline: The Giants will start Tommy DeVito in Week 12, having released Daniel Jones in a surprise move Friday. DeVito averaged 7.2 yards per attempt throwing outside the numbers in 2023, while Jones has averaged just 4.9 yards per attempt on throws outside the numbers this season. The now-former starter’s 25.8% completion rate on throws of 20-plus yards is the second worst among qualifying quarterbacks, per PFF. Jones just leaves so many open vertical plays on the field. I’m not convinced DeVito will be an upgrade for Malik Nabers (currently dealing with a groin injury), but he’s at least willing to try to push it downfield. One reason to maybe watch: Beyond any revenge-game narratives, it bears watching Jonnu Smith in this matchup. Many fantasy gamers have been confused as to why the once-heralded Dolphins wide receivers aren’t producing near their assumed standard. Well, a big part of this development is that the Jonnu Smith plays are … really good. Since Week 8, Smith ranks sixth in team offensive success rate on his targets. Other tight ends in that area are Brock Bowers, George Kittle and Trey McBride. That’s the company Smith is keeping; good things happen when his team throws the ball in his direction. The receivers deserve credit for clearing the space for Smith to run after the catch on those looks and pile up the efficiency. However, the Dolphins don’t have much incentive to change up their volume distribution just for the sake of your fantasy teams, given the effectiveness of the overall unit. One reason to maybe watch: Jayden Daniels hasn’t just been off his game the last two weeks. Statistically, he’s been one of the most inefficient quarterbacks in the sport. Daniels ranks 24th in adjusted net yards per attempt over the last two weeks among quarterbacks with 20-plus dropbacks. He was third in Weeks 1-9. Most troubling is that Daniels’ pressure-to-sack ratio of 50% is tied with Joe Flacco for the most among quarterbacks. The offensive line hasn’t allowed a ton of pressure but Daniels has just turned almost all of those moments into negative plays. Washington has played two of the better defenses in the league in the last couple of weeks in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Dallas operates on the other end of that spectrum but their pass rush has improved with Micah Parsons back on the field. This is a good moment for Daniels to get his Rookie of the Year campaign back on track if he can withstand the pressure from the Cowboys. One reason to maybe watch: Nico Collins only ran a route on 55.3% of the team dropbacks, falling in behind both Tank Dell and John Metchie III. Obviously, he is the team’s best receiver and we should expect that number to push toward 80% when he’s fully ramped up. Does that start this week? The Texans need it. The Titans aren’t a great team, but their defense presents some problems, especially in terms of creating interior pressure. Houston has been one of the worst teams in football at picking up blitzes and blocking up stunts. If those issues creep up, C.J. Stroud will need Collins available as the quick answer. One reason to maybe watch: The Broncos are a good team. The Raiders sink this game into the doldrums of the week. We’re keeping an eye on the weekly Bo Nix ascension. There's some real staying power to the Bo Nix production. As @Nate_Tice and I highlight here, he's not making mistakes and executing a well-designed offense. pic.twitter.com/hnAG2FghSZ — Matt Harmon (@MattHarmon_BYB) November 21, 2024 Nix is executing the Broncos offense. That unit is much better designed than it was to start the season and they have some intriguing pass-catchers. Most of the Broncos wideouts are big-bodied players who can present themselves as reliable targets over the middle. That aligns well with Nix’s skill set and allows Denver to work well against zone coverage. Courtland Sutton is the only fantasy starter of the bunch but the rest of the big receivers help lift the floor of the passing attack. I’ve even enjoyed how Sean Payton has mixed Marvin Mims Jr. into the equation as a gadget receiver and designed rusher. Denver should be able to clear this Raiders team with ease if its claim to the AFC’s playoff push is legitimate."

Smith is coming off his best week of the season. In Week 10, Smith produced 100 yards and two touchdowns on eight targets against the Raiders. Smith has now earned six or more targets in five of his last six games. This is something only three other tight ends have done during this stretch. Smith now leads the Dolphins since Week 5 with a 21% target share. He also ranks third in yards per route run and second in yards after the catch among TEs during this time. Smith is a great bye week filler for Week 12. But there’s a chance he’s much more than that. He’s been a top-two option in the Dolphins passing attack the past two months. Smith is closing in on being ranked as a top-10 TE the rest of the season. This week he takes on the Patriots, who rank bottom 10 in coverage according to PFF. You can pick up and play Smith this week. Swift had another strong fantasy day in Week 11. He was able to produce 80+ yards for the sixth time in his last seven games. Since Week 4, Swift ranks sixth in fantasy points per game among all backs. That’s how good he’s been. But it wasn’t all good news for Swift in Week 11. His underlying usage actually got worse under new play-caller Thomas Brown. Backup Roschon Johnson saw a season-high 44% of the snaps and handled 100% of the two-minute offense snaps and the majority of the goal-line touches. This led to Swift seeing just 48% of the backfield carries, his second-lowest mark in a game this year. That’s not great, and neither is his matchup this week against the Vikings. Minnesota allows the second-fewest rushing yards per play and just limited the Titans backfield to 15 yards on 12 carries in Week 11. It’s tough to sit Swift with six teams on bye, but temper your expectations in this difficult matchup. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Irving returns from his bye this week and finds himself in a great matchup. The Bucs are 5-point favorites against Tommy DeVito and the Giants. There’s a good chance New York falls behind in this game, which sets up a positive game script for Irving to see more carries. But it gets even better because the Giants struggle to defend the run. New York allows the most rushing yards per play this season according to NFL Pro. The Giants also allow the third most explosive runs of 10+ yards this season. This is the ideal matchup for Irving who has generated an explosive run at the 12th highest rate in the league. Irving also averages 5.6 yards per touch this season and ranks third in broken tackle rate. He’s coming off a strong performance in Week 10 against the 49ers where he totaled 87 yards and a touchdown on 16 touches. Expect this efficiency to continue in a strong matchup this week against the Giants and there’s even a chance we see his role increase coming out of the bye week. Don’t be shocked to see the rookie earn the first 20-carry game of his career. Robinson Jr. had one of the tougher matchups a running back can find last week, facing the Eagles' No. 1 ranked defense on a short week. Despite this difficult spot, Robinson was able to produce over 70 total yards and a touchdown. The most impressive part was this was Robinson’s first game back from both a hamstring and knee injury. He returned from these injuries and took back his role as the Commander clear RB1 earning 67% of the backfield carries, his second-best usage on the season. Robinson enters Week 12 with a much better matchup against the Cowboys. Dallas ranks 30th in run defense according to PFF and allows the fourth-most fantasy points per game to the position. Expect Robinson to carry the ball 16+ times and push towards 100 yards and a score. He’s a must-start RB this week. Jennings continues to operate as the 49ers' No. 1 receiver. In Week 11, he led the team with 10 catches for 91 yards and a score. He was consistently Brock Purdy’s first read in crucial situations. Jennings earned six of his 11 targets on third down last week. This is the money down in the NFL — the down where you lean on your best and most trusted player, and lately, that’s been Jennings for the 49ers. In three games this season with either Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel Sr. out, Jennings has averaged 11.3 targets and 116 yards per game. He’s never seen fewer than 11 targets in any of these three contests and is the number one fantasy receiver across those three weeks. This is still a small sample size, but it’s becoming clear that Jennings is the 49ers' No. 1 receiver ahead of Samuel. This week, Jennings faces a Packers secondary that may not have cornerback Jaire Alexander and just allowed Caleb Williams to complete 74% of his passes last week. Jennings is a borderline top-12 receiver this week and for the rest of the season. Make sure he’s in your lineup, even without Brock Purdy under center as he works through a shoulder injury. We have six teams on bye this week. Some top quarterbacks like Josh Allen and Joe Burrow are not available for fantasy managers. A bye-week filler is needed, and the perfect option is Drake Maye. Maye has finished as a top-10 QB in two of his five completed starts this season and has never finished worse than the QB18 on a given week. This is impressive for a rookie QB but it’s even more impressive when you factor in his top receiver has been Kayshon Boutte, and he plays behind arguably the worst offensive line in the league. Not to mention, Maye had to face the Titans and Bears defenses in two out of his last three games. Both teams rank top five at limiting opposing passing efficiency. But despite these tough matchups, Maye was able to find success. He completed 71% of his passes against the Titans and averaged a season-high 7.4 yards per attempt against the Bears. Maye is also coming off one of his better outings of the season where he completed 75% of his passes for 309 total yards and two touchdowns against the Rams in Week 11. His composure under pressure and strong rushing upside make him a solid start this week, even if the matchup isn’t the best against the Dolphins. If you need help at QB this week, pick up and play Maye as your bye-week filler. Ridley earned just four catches for 58 yards last week against the Vikings. This was his first game below 70 yards or eight targets since DeAndre Hopkins was traded to the Chiefs. Entering Week 11, Ridley was averaging an elite 36% target share and 100 yards per game in the three games since Hopkins left the team. Ridley came back down to earth in Week 11, but he still earned a team-high 22% target share. This week, Ridley is looking to bounce back against the Texans as an eight-point underdog. The Titans should trail often in this one which sets up nicely for Ridley to see more passing volume. Believe it or not, Will Levis has been solid since returning from injury. In Week 10 against the Chargers, he completed 78% of his passes and posted a top-10 fantasy finish. Then in Week 11, Levis produced 295 yards while averaging 9.5 yards per attempt. His play has been much better than what we got earlier this season. The improved quarterback play, and game script, have Ridley set up for a strong bounce back in Week 12. Evans is expected to return from injury this week. He’s missed the past three games with a hamstring injury that he reaggravated in Week 7 against the Ravens. Evans will return to face a Giants secondary that ranks 16th in coverage this season according to PFF. This is by no means a bad secondary, but they aren’t great either. New York allows the seventh most explosive plays on defense this season and that sets up nicely for Evans who has eight deep targets across five completed starts. Evans has finished as a top-10 receiver in three of his five completed starts and he’s earned a strong 23% target share in these five contests. But this should only increase now that Chris Godwin is out for the year. Godwin earned a 27% target share this season and with him off the field, Evans should threaten for 10+ targets. That starts this week in a fine matchup against the Giants, but the good matchups will continue the rest of the year. Evans will face the Panthers twice, the Raiders and the Cowboys over the next six weeks. All of these teams rank in the bottom 10 in secondary play this season according to NFL Pro. Evans is trending up at the perfect time as the fantasy playoffs approach. Jones entered Week 11 battling a rib injury. This was the fourth time this season he had picked up an injury that would go on to limit him or keep him out of practice the following week. Jones was limited in practice heading into Week 11 but was able to play on Sunday. However, he saw his worst usage in a completed game this season earning just 55% of the snaps and 50% of the rush attempts. Cam Akers was more involved for the Vikings in Week 11, turning 12 touches into 36 yards and a touchdown. Jones was likely limited in this game due to his rib injury, but there’s also a chance the Vikings try to lighten his load moving forward. He’s turning 30 next month and has already battled injuries to his ribs, hamstring, hip and ankle this season. Week 11 has created plenty of questions for fantasy managers of Jones entering Week 12. Will his usage improve with another week of rest and recovery? Will Cam Akers remain heavily involved? This week against the Bears should answer a lot of these questions about Jones' role the rest of the season. He’s still a top-20 RB this week, but I’d start Chuba Hubbard, Rhamondre Stevenson and Brian Robinson Jr. over him right now."

The Golden State superstar explained on the latest episode of ""Dubs Talk"" how remarkable Hield’s work ethic has been since joining the team over the summer. “It’s like when [Kevin Durant] came and you see how a guy at the top of the list of a certain skillset, you see how they work,” Curry told NBC Sports Bay Area’s Monte Poole and Dalton Johnson. “Watching Buddy, I know he talks about me. I know there’s a clip where he was doing a post-practice interview and he was like, ‘Y'all are interrupting my time to watch Steph shoot.’ I do the exact same thing with him. “I will fully admit he shoots way more shots than I do in practice. It’s not even close. The volume is insane. And it’s something I never really knew was part of his routine.” Hield has developed into one of the NBA's elite long-range shooters and has made more 3-pointers than any other NBA player over the past five seasons. His addition to the Warriors has lessened Klay Thompson's departure, giving Golden State another scoring option off the bench. For Curry, it's Hield’s approach to shooting that has impressed him the most so far. “He's a workaholic, he’s a gym rat, he loves to get shots up until it feels right,” Curry told Poole and Johnson. “I’m a little bit more calculated about the intensity and where I’m getting shots. So, it’s kind of cool to see two different approaches. We’re motivating each other in that respect. I did it with Klay for 13 years and now I have a new running mate to push me.” The “Splash Buddies” pairing has worked out exceedingly well for Golden State. The team is off to a 9-2 start on the season thanks to some lethal shooting from the duo. The 31-year-old is averaging 16.6 points per game, the second most in the NBA among bench players. Meanwhile, Curry continues to be one of the best players on the planet, capable of taking over games and willing the Warriors to victory. While there is no replicating the magic of the Curry-Thompson pairing, Hield is doing a more than admirable job in his first season with the Warriors. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"

Defensive end Nick Bosa will not play either. Purdy did not practice on Friday, which made his status uncertain. But head coach Kyle Shanahan officially announced he was out when meeting with reporters after practice. Brandon Allen will start at quarterback versus Green Bay. Additionally, left tackle Trent Williams is listed as questionable with an ankle injury and will be a game-time decision, according to Shanahan. Kyle Shanahan shares final injury updates ahead of #SFvsGB. pic.twitter.com/YkLXWux8dw — San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) November 22, 2024 Earlier Friday, the NFL listed Purdy as out on its injury report. He was previously listed as questionable, but has now been officially downgraded. Bosa was also listed as out on the injury report due to hip and oblique issues. He suffered the injury in practice on Nov. 6 and played through the injury in Week 10's matchup with Tampa Bay. The pass rusher left last week's matchup with the Seahawks in the third quarter and did not return. Following the game, Bosa told reporters that he hurt his oblique while compensating for the hip injury. Williams suffered his injury in Week 10, as well. He played against Seattle after taking a painkilling injection for his ankle, but that may have made the situation worse. The veteran offensive lineman did not participate in practice all week.

Purdy stopped after approximately five minutes, had his shoulder worked on by trainers and went back to the locker room, according to reporters on the scene. Purdy appeared to suffer the injury during last week's 20-17 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. He finished the game, yet did not make any throws over 10 yards following the hit that potentially injured him. There was no indication afterward that Purdy was hurt. Allen is in his second season with the 49ers after seeing no action behind Purdy and Sam Darnold during the 2023-24 campaign. He played 2019 with the Denver Broncos, followed by three seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals."

Analyst Tera Roberts helps us sort through the mess!","With six teams on a bye in Week 12, fantasy football managers are presented with two major problems — they must trust the boom-bust players they’ve been avoiding and lean on the big-name players who have been letting them down week after week. This isn’t a week for the faint of heart. Playoffs are right around the corner, and this week’s choices could make the difference between playoffs or the consolation bracket. We’ll look at players from two perspectives this week — Big Names with Big Problems and Bye Week Booms. Heading into the season, I thought the Vikings would use Ty Chandler as a complementary back to ensure Jones wasn’t overused. Aside from the challenges of being a 29-year-old running back, Jones has never been a true workhorse. He’s been a back who produces as an RB1 within a committee. Instead of repeating this effective approach, the Vikings gave Jones significant volume. Through 10 games, Jones has logged 157 rushing attempts. If he continues at this pace, he’ll exceed his previous career high of 236 carries, which was way back in 2019. Earlier in the season, when his legs were fresher, Jones was explosive, efficient and effective. Over the past four games, he has struggled significantly, averaging just 3.5 yards per carry and 9.2 fantasy points per game in half-PPR formats. This is a sharp contrast to his first 10 games, where he averaged 4.6 yards per carry and 13.5 fantasy points per game. The Vikings realized the need for another back and traded for Cam Akers, who has logged 23 carries over the past two games. Will Jones make or break your lineup in Week 12? Akers has been predictably inefficient, but the team continues to give him volume, likely in hopes of alleviating the strain on Jones. Despite the addition of Akers, Jones is still seeing solid volume; he’s simply no longer capitalizing on it. This week, he faces an advantageous matchup against the Chicago Bears. While the Bears’ defense has been strong overall, they are clearly weaker against the run. Statistically, Jones should get a rushing touchdown in this matchup. Despite the struggles, Jones could break through and have an RB1 week. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Before we dive into any numbers, let’s call a spade a spade; Deebo Samuel Sr. has flat-out looked awful. It hasn’t been a season of perfect health for him, but that’s nothing new. Another common pattern for Samuel is his tendency to oscillate between good and bad seasons. After a terrible 2022, Samuel admitted he was out of shape and rebounded in 2023. Now, in 2024, it feels like we’re watching a repeat of 2022 — which, inevitably, means 2025 could be a bounce-back year, so make a note of that ... but we can’t wait for the 2025 bounce-back. We need Samuel now. Will Samuel make or break your lineup in Week 12? Samuel is a special talent and there’s still time for him to turn things around this season, but it’s tough to trust him right now. He has clearly taken a backseat to George Kittle and Jauan Jennings and has just two total touchdowns on the season. This week, Samuel faces a Green Bay defense that has generally been strong against the pass. On one hand, this is a good opportunity to take advantage of his rushing upside. On the other, it’s difficult to believe he’ll provide strong receiving production this week. Samuel is, yet again, a risky flex play with bust potential. Adding to his risk is the absence of his starting quarterback in Week 12, as Brock Purdy is out with a shoulder injury. Backup Brandon Allen will start in his place. If you’ve read my articles before, you’ll know I’ve been pleasantly surprised with Pollard for most of the season. Unlike Samuel and Jones, Pollard has no issues with his performance, despite being in a terrible offensive situation. Weeks 1 through 9, Pollard was a respectable RB22 in average points per game in half-PPR, averaging 13.2 points. He ranked seventh in total carries and averaged a solid 4.4 yards per carry. However, much of his high volume earlier in the season was due to Tyjae Spears dealing with injuries. Over the past two weeks, with Spears active, there’s been a sharp decline in Pollard’s usage. Pollard has had just nine carries in each of the past two games and has failed to reach double-digit fantasy points. Will Pollard make or break your lineup in Week 12? The Titans have stated they want to reduce Pollard’s workload, perhaps out of concern for his long-term effectiveness. While this makes him wildly unreliable for fantasy purposes, there’s a potential silver lining. Spears is currently in concussion protocol and has been ruled out for Week 12, which means we could see the return of the old 20-30 touch version of Pollard. I have long-term concerns for Pollard in this offense, but with Spears inactive, he offers RB1 upside — even with a less-than-ideal matchup. Aside from his Week 1 start, Worthy is coming off his best performance of the year. He recorded four receptions on five targets for 61 yards and a touchdown. What made this even more impressive was that it came against a stout Buffalo secondary. While Worthy has had similar performances earlier this season, this was the first week where he truly felt like the Chiefs’ WR1. He felt like the star — consistent and poised for more. It’s starting to feel like we could be on the verge of a rookie breakout in the second half of the season. Fantasy managers may understandably want to dive in headfirst, especially with a matchup against a seemingly good matchup in the Panthers. However, the Panthers haven’t allowed a receiving touchdown since Week 6 (to Drake London). Volume is still possible, but the Panthers’ secondary seems to be developing and trending in a positive direction. Will Worthy make or break your lineup in Week 12? I’m actually a bit hesitant to lean into Worthy given the matchup. Comparatively, the Panthers have allowed the 11th fewest fantasy points to opposing receivers but the most fantasy points to opposing running backs. If I’m predicting the Chiefs’ offensive approach to this matchup, pushing extremely high volume through the air doesn’t make sense. They’ll likely rely on their ground game, lean on their defense and limit Worthy’s involvement. He’ll likely see a maximum of five targets and will need a touchdown to have a productive day. Bateman is having the best season of his career, already surpassing his previous highs in receiving yards and touchdowns. Unfortunately, his leap in production hasn’t come with consistency. Calling it a lack of consistency might be underselling it. He can finish as the overall WR2 one week and WR78 the next. He’s a boom-or-bust player who is heavily touchdown-dependent due to a lack of volume. The good news is that Bateman’s boom games aren’t difficult to predict, as the Ravens’ offensive approach is fairly straightforward. Against weaker pass defenses, Baltimore tends to attack through the air and Bateman often thrives. His touchdowns this season have come against Dallas, both Cincinnati games and Tampa Bay — all defenses with clear struggles against the pass. Will Bateman make or break your lineup in Week 12? Bateman faces the Chargers who are very average against the pass, allowing the 16th most fantasy points to opposing receivers. Recently, they’ve been lit up by big-play receivers and even secondary receivers like Xavier Worthy and Calvin Austin III have had success against them. This matchup profiles as a strong opportunity for Bateman to deliver another big performance. It’s risky but he’s a high-upside bye week fill-in. Busted coverage or not, I’m ready to give Jim Harbaugh Coach of the Year purely for taking Quentin Johnston from arguably one of the worst receivers in the league to a shockingly usable fantasy asset. That said, it does feel a bit uncomfortable to fully lean into Johnston. A significant portion of his production has come from coverage breakdowns and it’s clear he still has some development to do. Will Johnston make or break your lineup in Week 12? Last week, Johnston caught two of his eight targets for 48 yards and scored a touchdown, delivering another solid fantasy outing. However, his fantasy value remains heavily reliant on touchdowns. He has three touchdowns this season and has finished inside the top 30 in those weeks. With Justin Herbert playing at an elite level, the Chargers have a beautiful matchup this week against the Baltimore Ravens — a game where Johnston could thrive. Johnston has legitimate flex value and with his boom-bust nature, could provide week-winning upside in Week 12."

To help you make them, here's a look at six players with bust potential in Week 12. Something to keep in mind as you're reading: a ""fade"" or ""bust"" designation doesn't automatically mean you should sit a player, depending on the depth of the rest of your roster or available options on your waiver wire. It's really difficult to imagine fading a fantasy quarterback throwing to Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua on any given week — especially in what could be a high-scoring matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles with plenty of offensive firepower on both sidelines. However, this feels like the ultimate trap game ... in particular for Rams QB Matthew Stafford. Stafford is coming off his best fantasy performance of the season in Week 11, going 18-of-27 for 295 passing yards and 4 TDs against the New England Patriots, resulting in 27.8 fantasy points as the overall QB5 on the week. While it would appear that a matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles could be intriguing at first glance, it bears repeating that this Eagles secondary is not the same as it was last year. The unit that ranked top-three in net passing yards per game (255.7) and second-most passing TDs all season (38) is no more; it's the Reed Blankenship, Cooper DeJean and Quinyon Mitchell show now. Joining Darius Slay and C.J. Gardner-Johnson in the secondary, this group of defensive backs has been massively underrated, allowing the second-fewest pass yards per game (172.2), a league-low 5.0 yards per pass attempt and tied for the third-fewest passing touchdowns all season (9). Heat check 🔥 Unless you're in a two-QB or Superflex league, Stafford is better left on fantasy benches this week, even despite an intriguing 49.5-point projected total from oddsmakers this week. Carolina Panthers RB Chuba Hubbard has had a standout season in 2024 and was handsomely rewarded for his production (on one of the league's worst offenses, mind you) with a nice, big contract extension. He showed he was worth it in the game immediately following, too, posting 169 scrimmage yards and a score in Week 10 ahead of their bye. Despite his recent dominance this season, there are two glaring reasons to suspect Hubbard won't keep up the path of production. The first of those reasons is the matchup; this week, the Panthers will face the Kansas City Chiefs, who have been among the most prolific run defenses this year, holding opposing RBs to a league-low 3.11 yards per carry and giving up a league-low 522 rushing yards over 10 games. Their 12.82 fantasy points per game allowed to the position ranks dead last in the league. Paired with the difficult matchup on deck is the planned debut for second-round rookie RB Jonathon Brooks, who will play in his first NFL game coming off a torn ACL which has held him out so far this year. It doesn't seem likely that he'll hold a significant role in Week 12, but any chunk of the pie he gets is a piece off Hubbard's plate. Heat check 🔥 You'll likely be in a position where you need to start Hubbard given the six teams that are on a bye this week. However, it's best to expect something closer to an RB3/RB4 performance from him, rather than his standard top-12 finish, even if Brooks does handle a minimal role. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. The Chicago Bears have undergone a significant shift over the past two weeks, firing former OC Shane Waldron and promoting passing coordinator Thomas Brown to call plays in the meantime. In Brown's first game calling plays, the offense managed its highest yardage total (391) since October 6's win over the Carolina Panthers — that's the good news. Usually, that would mean exciting things for the run game, but there's another side to that coin (the bad news). In Week 12, the Bears will get a matchup with the Minnesota Vikings, a matchup that has ranked among the league's most stifling this season. The Vikings defense is allowing the second-lowest YPC average (3.6), second-fewest rush yards after contact per attempt (2.4) and the third-lowest explosive run rate (9.3%) this season, giving up the second-least fantasy points per game to opposing RBs (14.54). Another interesting tidbit worth noting in terms of Swift's upside in the week to come is an increase in workload for backup RB Roschon Johnson last week. He saw a season-high offensive snap rate of 42% and earned a season-high 11 touches. The fact that this bump in usage coincided with the coaching shift is intriguing. Plus Swift is dealing with a groin injury that forced him out of practice Wednesday, though HC Matt Eberflus says he's hopeful he'll play. Heat check 🔥 Swift should be started in most leagues, barring much better options, as he's exhibited a fairly safe floor dating back to Week 4, with 10+ fantasy points in all but one game since then. However, a challenging matchup paired with an uptick in work for Johnson last week makes Swift less appealing than usual. We're fading the passer this week, so why not fade his top target? As noted above, the Philadelphia Eagles have had a sneaky-good passing defense since Cooper DeJean took over a near-full-time role in Week 6. Though he plays primarily slot corner, his presence has virtually transformed the secondary into a shutdown unit. Since Week 6, here's a look at the performance of the Eagles' secondary against targets to WRs lined up out wide and where it ranks among other defenses per Next Gen Stats: 36.8% passing success rate (league-low) 45.4 NFL passer rating (league-low) 45.6% completion rate (league-low) -0.15 EPA per dropback (second-lowest) 273 yards (third-fewest) The Eagles' secondary is also the only team to not allow a single touchdown to WRs lined up out wide in that span. Given that Nacua primarily plays along the boundary (74% snap rate this season) while teammate Cooper Kupp mans the slot at a 69% snap rate, there are realistic concerns that he could have an inefficient day. Heat check 🔥 Under no circumstances do you bench Nacua; he's a star with absurd play strength and does benefit from lining up alongside Kupp, which could help split coverage against this stingy Eagles' secondary. However, if this is the week you need a monster game, brace yourself for a potential disappointment. There was a point earlier this season (right around Weeks 4-8) where many suspected they'd found the answer to their tight end woes in second-year Packer Tucker Kraft. Unfortunately, his level of consistency as a red-zone weapon has tapered off in recent weeks, failing to produce a single catch in Week 11 coming off Green Bay's bye. Just in case you were holding out hope for a bounce-back performance, however, it doesn't seem likely to come up against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 12, even if they do layup some designed touches for him one week out from his goose egg. The 49ers have been a challenging matchup for opposing tight ends this season, failing to allow a single TE more than 10 fantasy points in a single matchup, giving up the second-lowest Y/A average on targets to the position in the league (5.5), only behind the Houston Texans. Their 44.6% success rate on pass attempts targeting TEs ranks fourth-lowest in the league, per Next Gen Stats, allowing just 356 yards (fourth-fewest) and 2 TDs (tied for ninth-fewest) to the position all season. Heat check 🔥 There's an expectation for a certain level of volatility every time you roll out a Packers pass catcher, but given the Niners' strengths over the middle of the field and history of shutting down more-than-capable TEs this season, Kraft is better left on your bench. Consider a streaming option like rookie Ja'Tavion Sanders, who has a favorable matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs this week."

Turbo-charged Justin Herbert. Derrick Henry screen pass wrinkles. Lamar Jackson advantages vs. the Chargers' defense. Nate Tice breaks down one of the biggest games of Week 12.,"John and Jim Harbaugh face off as the Ravens take on the Chargers in Los Angeles on Monday Night Football this week. (You can join me and fellow Yahoo Sports NFL writer Charles McDonald for the game in the new Discussion tool in the Yahoo Sports app. Here's how.) The Chargers are surging behind disciplined and well-coached units on either side of the ball, while the Ravens are thriving with an explosive offense (that hit its yearly Steelers speed bump) and a defense that’s stout against the run but is susceptible to big plays through the air. Heading full steam ahead into this season’s HarBowl (something we might get more frequently with both brothers now coaching teams in the AFC), I wanted to take this week’s Football 301 Playbook to break down the surprising Chargers and how their matchup with the Ravens looks this week. I hope you’re sitting down when reading this, because what I’m about to say might be shocking: The Chargers under Jim Harbaugh like to run the ball and use play action. Ol’ Jimmy and offensive coordinator Greg Roman aren’t exactly subverting their reputation in their first year in Los Angeles. The Chargers rank fifth in designed rush rate on early downs and have the highest rate of play action on early downs as well. While this is Harbaugh’s (and the Harbaugh-adjacent Roman’s) tried and true formula, the Chargers haven’t exactly been effective when running the ball. They currently sit 30th in early down success rate on running back runs, with their 29.7% rate sitting well below the NFL’s average of 36.1% on such plays. Even if you look at splits between the halves of games or over the past six weeks, the Chargers still rank among the league’s worst in terms of success rate. There have still been flashes with this run game in between their 1- and 2-yard ventures. A healthier J.K. Dobbins (who is facing his old team this game) has had some real flashes, popping big runs in key moments when the Chargers are closing out games in the second half. (While they haven’t been efficient, the Chargers do rank more in the middle of the pack in explosive RB runs this season, and eighth in explosive run rate in the second half of games.) This is a reminder of the talent of the oft-injured Dobbins and that there is still life with these runs as the game goes along. It’s something that has popped in multiple Chargers games this year, including this past Sunday night against the Bengals as Dobbins delivered the knockout punch late in the fourth quarter.

Their run game is varied (a little more window dressing wouldn’t hurt), featuring plenty of gap schemes with pulling linemen and tight ends, often out of bigger personnel groupings. big boy Counter from the Chargers. It's so pretty. https://t.co/M1CyWjcoiY pic.twitter.com/5gzO7CCmCh — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) October 15, 2024 There have been sequences in games where you can see the Chargers find a play that an opposing defense simply cannot stop, like running a zone play against the Titans over and over with their fullback/defensive lineman Scott Matlock leading the way.

Watch Zion Johnson (#77) & FB Scott Matlock (#44) on this one. pic.twitter.com/5RmNSug9VF — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 11, 2024 So, while I do have positives to say about the designs and intent, the truth is this offense still leaves Herbert in plenty of tough situations when the Chargers have to drop back and pass. And Herbert, despite statistics that are more middle of the road when looking league-wide, has been playing some of the best and most aggressive football of his career. On early downs, the Chargers are able to stay explosive because of their steady diet of play-action concepts, with Herbert not shying away from launching throws to players like tight end Will Dissly — not exactly a burner — for touchdowns. good morning pic.twitter.com/v3NWCK1lND — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 21, 2024 Play-action concepts that the Chargers feature naturally attack down the field, and Herbert has been seeking more downfield throws than ever but still without making mistakes (just one interception on the season so far). His air yards per pass attempt sits at 8.6, over a full yard more than his career average of 7.4 yards entering this season and tied for eighth (with Lamar Jackson) among all qualifying QBs this season. These play-action concepts allow Herbert to show off his arm and ball placement. Every throw and part of the field is available to him on any type of concept. These help shore up a leaky interior offensive line as well as put less demands on pass catchers to win with their route running. Just get downfield and Justin will launch a laser into your facemask. This newfound aggressive Justin Herbert has also shown up when he runs the ball. Herbert is scrambling more than ever, looking to make plays with his legs rather than check the ball down or try to find the “perfect” answer. His scramble rate of 6.3% would be a career high, according to NextGenStats, and sits above the league average. He’s also looking for explosive plays when he runs the ball. Whether it’s the fourth down designed run against the Titans or scrambling against the Bengals. Herbert wants to inflict damage as a runner. Which is a scary sight for defenders to see a 6-foot-6, nearly 240-pound human who can max out at over 20 mph coming at them. 4th down ➡️ TOUCHDOWNJustin Herbert runs it in for the @Chargers score!📺: #TENvsLAC on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/V0nWnLI19S — NFL (@NFL) November 10, 2024 Herbo? https://t.co/LIuw7CAqhz pic.twitter.com/DNkYtUzUZ1 — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 10, 2024 Justin Herbert is crossing defenders up now pic.twitter.com/1KXjJDu1lu — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 11, 2024 This is Justin Herbert with a Jim Harbaugh symbiote attached to him. Herbert feels like he has a little more venom with his play this year. Gone are the quick game concepts from former OC Joe Lombardi that neutered Herbert’s S-tier arm talent. Instead, Herbert is seeking to push the ball whenever he can, even with less-than-ideal personnel around him. It’s not surprising that Herbert’s sack rate has jumped up a bit this season because of the asks of the offense, but his sack avoidance still remains one of his best attributes, and he continues to frustrate defenders with his ability to get throws off despite being in their grasp. And when things aren’t clean (which they still aren’t a decent amount of the time), Herbert is still overcoming subpar circumstances to deliver big throws ...

McConkey looks like a real deal No. 1 receiver who can win from the slot or on the outside (my pre-draft comparison for him was Emmanuel Sanders). McConkey is dealing with an injury this week, so it remains to be seen what his health is against the Ravens, but even the unwavering confidence that Herbert has with other players like Dissly and Quentin Johnston, who has greatly improved after his rough rookie year, has been showing up as well. And not once did we ever hear about Justin Herbert’s high ankle sprain hindering his play. Funny how that only comes up with certain QBs. The Ravens' defense will continue to be tough sledding for the Chargers on the ground. Baltimore is Guinness-like in its stoutness against the run, currently ranking second in EPA allowed per RB run while yielding the lowest explosive run rate in the NFL. The Ravens have only allowed six explosive runs (gains of 12 yards or more) this entire season. For comparison, the NFL average is 17.4 and the Commanders lead the league in this category with 29. The Chargers are going to have to turn to those play-action concepts on early downs and Herbert hero ball on late downs. The Ravens are below-average defending early down play action and are overall susceptible to explosive plays through the air. Very susceptible, I should say; Baltimore currently allows the third-highest rate of explosive passes this season, often because of communication errors on the back end of their defense. The spine of the defense could even be further weakened if linebacker Roquan Smith doesn’t play. Smith has taken a step back this season, but him dealing with a hamstring injury and potentially missing this week could make this weakness even more glaring. Harbaugh and Roman have an insistence to not mess with their run-first formula, which I get considering their personnel. But if there was a game to drop Herbert back more frequently and let him rip, this is it. This side of the ball is a true strength-on-strength. The Chargers' defense playing so well under Jesse Minter has been one of the pleasant surprises of the season. This unit ranks near the top of every metric you look at. And even despite facing several toothless offenses this season, it still ranks 10th in FTNFantasy’s DVOA metric that adjusts for opponent. Star veterans Joey Bosa, Khalil Mack, and Derwin James look like their old selves (when healthy, at least), with James providing impact plays every game from the slot, especially as a blitzer. Free agent additions Poona Ford and Teair Tart have shored up an interior defensive line that had been one of the biggest weak points in the entire NFL over the past few seasons. Teair Tart (#90) was constantly disruptive against the Bengals.Tart doesn't always fill up the boxscore, but he's been playing well all year. One of the several veteran Chargers defenders that have been rejuvenated this season.(Plus there's some Daiyan Henley) pic.twitter.com/xrjAn9kItb — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 20, 2024 Young players Tuli Tuipulotu (six pressures against the Bengals) and Daiyan Henley have leveled up this season and continue to get better every week. Henley in particular has been a revelation in this defense. Chargers get to a unconventional Cover 2 look. Jameis Winston actually works to the right spot but watch #0 Daiyan Henley drop from the LOS into the throwing lane. pic.twitter.com/TFqy92Gszj — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 5, 2024 Even non-star starters like linebacker Denzel Perryman have been playing the best ball of his career. This Chargers defense plays sound, with adaptable game plans that mold and shift based on their given opponent of the week. When there’s a unit punching above its weight, or seemingly getting the best out of all its contributors, it usually is indicative of the coaching and game-planning that is happening during the week on top of the work the players put into it. The Chargers' defense just feels tight. Zones tighten, coverage defenders will fall off their original assignments anticipating where the ball will likely go based on the scouted looks, defenders (always multiple) quickly rally to tackle ball carriers. Every game features a new pressure look, whether a real blitz or simulated, and pass rush plans that try to expose any weakness in the opposing team’s protection plan. Twists, loopers, slants. Games is what it’s typically called in football parlance. The Chargers throw all of these games at opposing offensive lines and pass protectors with their talented front, testing the rules and sheer ability that the opposing squad has in the trenches, in the backfield, and on the opposite sideline, poking and poking and hoping something will pop. Most NFL offenses simply don’t have the competence to hold up for 60-plus plays before letting some leakiness happen, and the Ravens' offensive line is no different. (On a sidenote, I’m really looking forward to seeing Ravens center Tyler Linderbaum against Ford and Tart.) On early downs, the Chargers run zone coverages at the second-highest rate in the NFL, with the featured coverage changing based on the matchup in this kaleidoscopic scheme. Often you will see Chargers defenders jumping to change their leverage when defending passing plays, sometimes in ways that seem unorthodox. This is a sign of a well-coached and well-scouted unit that knows how to pinpoint an opponent's tendencies. That works very well against teams lacking high-end talent, but can be preyed upon against teams that can execute or have a deeper bag of tricks to get to (like the Bengals in Week 11). The heavy use of zone coverages makes even more sense when you consider the personnel for the Chargers. This unit’s strength is along their front and not with their cornerbacks. Despite blitzing at the eighth-lowest rate on early downs, the Chargers rank third in pressure rate. Bosa, Mack, and Tuipulotu are a formidable group of pass rushers to deal with. When you drop in other strong contributors like Tart and Morgan Fox, the Chargers can bring heat after the QB without having to throw extra bodies at the problem. The Chargers lean into zone, make QBs work to find an answer, hope their pass rush can get home and also mitigate any coverage disadvantages they might have on the back end. It’s not to say that they don’t blitz at all. The Chargers like to throw in funkier looks on true passing downs like second-and-long or on third down when they want to create more chaos, and they bring pressure at around a league average rate on late downs. But given Lamar Jackson has been the best QB against the blitz this year, that blitz rate will be unlikely to climb after this week. (Jackson is 78 for 111 for 1,091 yards, 10 touchdowns and two interceptions against the blitz this season. He’s generated 50.1 EPA when teams bring five or more pass rushers. Jared Goff ranks second at 36.1.) The Chargers' soundness carries over when defending QB designed runs. They haven’t been tested with many, but when playing QBs like Kyler Murray, the Chargers defenders did a great job in staying disciplined against read plays. There is a tradeoff here when playing such specific zone coverages that will put multiple eyeballs on receiver route patterns: scrambles. The Chargers rank 27th in the amount of EPA they’ve allowed to QB scrambles this season and have allowed the third-most scramble yards per game, only behind the Jaguars and Giants. Because the Chargers like to match their coverages and will bracket receivers on passing downs (with a corner and safety essentially double-teaming one player), the opposing QB has chances to make plays with his legs if the pass rush can’t keep him contained since the coverage defenders are so focused on their assignments. Early downs against the Ravens should be really interesting, considering how devastating the Ravens have been. The Chargers make it a slog to run against, but that’s not to say you can’t catch them. They currently rank 26th in explosive run rate allowed and are going against Derrick Henry, Jackson, and a run game that can pop off at any time. The Chargers are also third against early down play action in terms of success rate allowed, which again speaks to the horses they have up front and the discipline on the back end to avoid catastrophic busts. Jackson and the Ravens are excellent on play-action plays, ranking second in success rate and EPA per dropback on early down play action concepts this season and seventh in yards per game off those passes, per TruMedia. That’s what makes this side of the ball so intriguing. The Ravens' offense is explosive, efficient, and electric. The Chargers have a talented front and are very well-coached at all three levels. There are loads of strength-on-strength areas and matchups between the two sides, which is typically entertaining because good plays will feel earned in this type of game. Both teams will mold their game plans based on the opponent, getting to their core plays in different ways or throwing in new twists for the opponent to deal with. How they use their personnel is an interesting subplot; the Ravens love trotting out their TEs and FB Patrick Ricard (they use personnel groupings with two or fewer WRs at the second-highest rate in the NFL), always threatening to steamroll a defense if they don’t want to match with bigger bodies. The Chargers, however, run dime personnel (six DBs) at the second-highest rate in the NFL and the highest rate when opposing offenses have two or fewer WRs on the field (14.5%, and no other defense is above 5%). And, somewhat counterintuitively, they’ve been good at defending bigger offensive personnel groupings too, which again speaks to the adaptability, effort, and execution this entire unit has played with this season. I will be curious if the Ravens decide to use Henry on a RB screen once or twice in this game as a way to slow down the pass rush, and also since it’s such a strength of Henry’s juggernaut-like running style. The Chargers, again because of their hyper-focused coverage responsibilities, have been susceptible to big plays against RB screens this season. They have only faced nine so far, but have allowed gains of 15, 37, 18, and 33 yards on those plays. Henry had 23 screen receptions in his last two seasons in Tennessee, with those going for 341 yards at a crisp 14.8 yards per play. Henry has only been used on two screens so far this season, but those gains have, of course, gone for 27 and 23 yards. Look for this as a way to catch the Chargers in one of their defensive line games and heavy zone coverages, giving Henry some space underneath. The Chargers under Jim Harbaugh have completely reflected his personality, and it’s palpable when you watch them. They play tough, they play hard, they play smart, and they play disciplined, with players on both sides of the ball playing to their fullest (and a few stars dropped in). They’ve benefitted from a not-particularly-difficult schedule so far, but have shown up against the better units and teams when they have faced them. And they also have a QB playing at a high level and more aggressive than ever. The Ravens also have one of those high-level QBs, one of the best offenses in the game and a defense that has real strengths (but a few glaring weaknesses). Chargers fans were as loud as I have ever heard them this past weekend against the Bengals on Sunday night. This Monday night HarBowl has plenty of reasons to crank those decibels up even more."

Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",How becoming a dad helped convince Sean McVay to remain Rams head coach,https://sports.yahoo.com/becoming-dad-helped-convince-sean-110020031.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 11:00:20 GMT","When Sean McVay was hired by the Rams as the youngest coach in NFL history, he was single. Now he's married with a son, and that has changed his life.","After the Rams hired Sean McVay in 2017, general manager Les Snead was eager to see the 30-year-old’s head-coaching process at work. During McVay’s first seven seasons, Snead often observed McVay in the coach’s office, busily scheming plays. Reading motivational books. Meeting with coaches, players and team executives. So Snead was shocked last August when he witnessed something totally unexpected: McVay making faces and cooing baby talk on a video call. “Of all the things I thought I would see Sean McVay do,” Snead said, “that was not on the list.” On Oct. 24, 2023, McVay and wife Veronika welcomed a newborn son, Jordan John McVay. Read more: NFL Week 12 picks: Rams-Eagles and Chargers-Ravens ... who's ready for prime time? It was the latest personal milestone for McVay, who became the youngest coach in modern NFL history when owner Stan Kroenke signed off on making him the Rams’ on-field leader. NFL fans since have watched McVay literally grow up on the sideline while leading the Rams to five playoff appearances, two Super Bowl trips and a Super Bowl title to end the 2021-22 season. McVay, 38, also has come of age off the field. McVay and Veronika married in June 2022. The next season, as the Rams and McVay suffered through the worst Super Bowl hangover in history, McVay contemplated stepping away from coaching. But the impending birth of his son, and the opportunity to serve as an example of persevering through hard times, factored into his decision to return. Being a husband, and a father to Jordan, McVay said, has given him “real purpose” off the field. Also on it. “I definitely think it does make you a better coach,” he said. At the 2017 NFL owners meetings, a reporter asked Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll how he thought McVay would fare with the Rams. Carroll, a grandfather well into his third stint as an NFL head coach, said there was no question that the bright and knowledgeable McVay would excel. The challenges, Carroll noted, might come off the field because nearly all NFL coaches start families as college or pro assistants, before they ascend to the top job. McVay would navigate that path with the weight of an entire pro football organization on his shoulders. One year into fatherhood, McVay is managing fine. Read more: Safety Kamren Curl has an eagle eye on defending Rams' next opponent “I’m still getting a good amount of sleep,” quipped the notoriously early riser. McVay said his late grandfather John, a former NFL coach and longtime executive for the San Francisco 49ers, his father Tim and uncles Jim and John set great examples as fathers and mentors. So did former Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris, other current and former assistants and players such as former Rams offensive lineman Andrew Whitworth. “The way that they lead their families is unbelievable to me,” McVay said. Morris, now the coach of the Atlanta Falcons, became a father in 2010 before his second season as coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Morris, who worked with McVay at Tampa Bay and also in Washington before joining McVay’s Rams staff in 2021, often told McVay that becoming a father changes what happens when coaches cross the threshold of their home or greet family after a game. “You’re teaching your kids a lesson from that point on,” said Morris, who has three children. “Even when they’re at Jordan’s age, and you come in the house and you see those eyes looking at you, it’s a different deal. “You realize why you’re doing it and what you’re doing it for. And everything else is secondary when you look at those kids in that moment.” Whitworth, a father of four, signed with the Rams in 2017 and played until 2021, when he was 40. Being a father has provided the obsessively goal-oriented McVay something new to “chase,” Whitworth said. Read more: Rams tackle Andrew Whitworth on playing at 40: 'It's pretty wild' “He’s got a chance to look at Jordan every day and look at Veronika and say, ‘I would love to freak out about how practice went today, I would love to freak out about where we are as a team right now — that’s normally what I would do,’” said Whitworth, now a broadcaster for Amazon Prime. “‘But in this moment, I’m going to put Jordan in my lap and I’m going to have some perspective. … This is my priority and I want to be great at it.’” McVay and Veronika, who was born in Ukraine, met when McVay was an assistant coach in Washington and she was a student at George Mason University in Virginia. McVay spoke often about wanting to become a father, but actually becoming one “transformed” him in meaningful ways, amplifying qualities he already possessed, Veronika said. He is now more patient, empathetic, thoughtful and compassionate at home and at work, she said. “He prioritizes quality family time and being fully present even when he has those long days at the facility,” said Veronika, a real estate agent. “He’s just so excited to come home and see our little man. And Jordan always can put a smile on his face even on those toughest days.” In the offseason, McVay made it a point to be home in time to help put Jordan to bed. During the season, it is more of a challenge, but Friday nights and breakfast before home games are set aside for family time. “The things that he really cherishes in his life, the things that he loves — they’re not all in one basket anymore.” Rams receiver Cooper Kupp, on coach Sean McVay as a father And fatherly duties such as changing diapers. ""I've had some moments where I'm holding him, and you look down and you're like, 'OK, how did that end up on me?'"" McVay said, laughing. ""I get down and dirty with that."" McVay also prioritizes being present when working from his home office. “He comes in and out and says, ‘I need a mental break,’” Veronika said. Still, football is never too far from his mind. “Whenever he’s got an idea in his head, he’ll say, ‘I have to run back in there. I’ll be right back,’” she said, laughing. McVay’s parents see similarities in their son and grandson. McVay’s habit of being in constant motion dates to his childhood. “He was a busy guy,” his father said. So is Jordan, who often chases McVay in a rolling baby walker. “He’s very active like Sean, but he’s very chill like Veronika,” said McVay’s mother, Cindy, who paused a beat before laughing and adding. “And Sean was never chill.” In 2022, as the Rams stumbled to a 5-12 record, Rams executives watched McVay struggle to navigate the team’s faltering play. Afterward, with broadcast networks beckoning, McVay pondered taking a break from coaching. His son’s impending arrival led him to reconsider. “I never would have been able to look at him and say, ‘You know, when tough times hit, you push through it and grow from adversity,’” McVay said. “If I had run away from it, it would be, “Do as I say, not as I did.’” Last season, the Rams started 3-6 but McVay kept himself together. Jordan was born in the midst of the team’s second-half turnaround that resulted in a 10-7 record and a playoff berth. Fatherhood helped McVay balance that “kind of maniacal” sense that also makes him a great coach, Rams president Kevin Demoff said. “For someone who’s always searched for balance,” Demoff said, “this helps provide it in a much more natural way without searching.” Defensive coordinator Chris Shula has known McVay since they were college teammates at Miami of Ohio. They have coached together since 2017. McVay was always great around kids, said Shula, the father of two. But he did not have a true concept of fatherhood and taking care of a baby until he began to go through it himself. “He’s still getting here at 3 in the morning, so I don’t think it’s changed anything with the work ethic or the motivation,” Shula said. “But I think just the internal joy and doing it for others, I think that’s really what you see.” There also is external joy. “When he gets that picture texted to him or he’s on Facetime,” said offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur, a father of two, “it just instantly lights him up.” McVay’s enthusiasm while sharing video of his son apparently rivals his excitement when evaluating and discussing a top draft prospect. “He loves being able to say, ‘Look how wired this guy is!'” Snead said. “‘Look how alert he is. Look how intense, urgent, enthusiastic and passionate he is.’ “It’s really cool.” Throughout the first 15 years of his coaching career, McVay saw players not only as highly skilled athletes but also as developing men from a variety of backgrounds. His view further evolved when he became a father, Veronika said. “He sees them as young people who are navigating their own struggles and triumphs,” she said, “and he understands now in a way that only a parent can, that each kid out there has their own story and needs support in their unique ways.” Rams players, many of them also young fathers, noted subtle changes in McVay since he became a parent. “Something about his energy,” said safety John Johnson III, a father of a son. “His spirit is kind of different, kind of like he’s doing this for somebody, like he has more purpose. “I kind of feel that vibe.” McVay still pulls players aside for chats about their roles on the team. Or their assignments on the field. But now children also come into play. “I’m much more inclined to ask about those things,” McVay said, “because I’m now that dad showing the pictures and videos.” Read more: Rams-Patriots takeaways: With four TD passes, Matthew Stafford keeps breaking records Quarterback Matthew Stafford, a father to four girls, said “it’s football all the time” when the Rams are at work preparing for the season or opponents. But there’s also time to pause. “You can tell a story here or there of, ‘Hey, Tuesday afternoon I was playing goalie at my girls’ soccer practice … and my girls were yelling at me because I was afraid of the ball or something,’” Stafford said. “His son isn’t old enough to quite do some of those things, but I know he enjoys sharing stories back on what’s going on at home, which is cool to see.” Receiver Cooper Kupp began his Rams career the same year as McVay. Kupp, a father of three, said there is no mystery why McVay enthusiastically shares fatherhood experiences. “The things that he really cherishes in his life, the things that he loves — they’re not all in one basket anymore,” Kupp said, adding, “That helps give you perspective, and levels you out a little bit.” Players who do not yet have children also have heard McVay weave fatherhood into his coaching role. Occasionally, he references lessons passed down to him by his father. “He’ll kind of mention like, ‘My dad used to say …,’” defensive lineman Kobie Turner said. “He takes a lot of what he’s learned from real life and what it seems like he learned from his father and applies it. “He often tries to relate to the guys in the room and talk about how he’s trying to be the best version of himself, not only for us as a team but also like, he’s a dad now.” Last month, McVay reached another milestone. The Rams defeated the Minnesota Vikings at SoFi Stadium to give McVay his 80th victory, moving him past the late John Robinson as the winningest coach in Rams history. McVay achieved the feat on his son’s first birthday. “That was the coolest,” McVay said, “and felt like a little God-wink right there for you. That was pretty special.” Read more: All his players say it: 'John Robinson was hands down my all-time favorite head coach' McVay’s parents said it also has been special to watch their son grow. “For being so hard charging and driven, I believe he’s worked even harder on taking care of himself for this,” Tim said. “And that makes him a better overall dude at the office and in coaching.” And at home. Watching her husband embrace fatherhood has been “a gift,” Veronika said. “It’s changed his perspective on some things in the best way possible,” she said, “and I think he’ll just keep growing from that.” The McVays know there will be challenges ahead. As children get older, so do their opportunities for activities in sports, music and other areas. Cindy McVay speaks from experience. “He’s going to have to figure out some things when Jordan starts his own sports,” she said. “You really don’t want to miss that kind of stuff, so that’s all going to be kind of a learning thing.” McVay is not looking too far ahead. Whether asked about his personal situation or his team’s chances of making the playoffs, he often speaks about “being where your feet are.” McVay’s are happily planted with his wife and son. “It’s a love you can never know,” he said, “until you have it.” Get the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Cubs' top 5 offseason questions: How does Cody Bellinger fit? And which free-agent pitchers will Chicago target?,https://sports.yahoo.com/cubs-top-5-offseason-questions-how-does-cody-bellinger-fit-and-which-free-agent-pitchers-will-chicago-target-202659637.html,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 20:26:59 GMT","The Cubs need help in the rotation and the bullpen, and they have a lot to sort out with their position players.","No matter how you slice it, the Chicago Cubs were one of the most disappointing teams of 2024. Improved play in the second half enabled a winning record and a second-place finish in the NL Central, but the Cubs finished six games out of a wild-card spot and a whopping 10 games behind the rival Brewers. At this time a year ago — before our collective focus shifted to star players such as Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto — the baseball industry was in shock following the Cubs’ ultra-aggressive maneuver to hire manager Craig Counsell away from Milwaukee with a five-year, $40 million deal, the largest contract ever given to a big-league skipper. That Milwaukee then ran away with the division while the Cubs were stuck in the mud for much of Counsell’s first season at the helm only made Chicago’s uninspiring campaign that much more frustrating. The Cubs have not reached the postseason since Jed Hoyer assumed the top front office role after Theo Epstein departed following the 2020 season, and they haven't won a postseason game since 2017. Considering the talent on the roster and the massive commitment made to Counsell, such shortcomings can be tolerated for only so much longer. This organization must find a way to reestablish itself as a legitimate contender in the National League, and quickly. Here are the five biggest questions facing the Cubs this winter. “Anytime a really good player decides to stay with you, that's good news,” Hoyer said earlier this month after Bellinger’s decision to pass on another round of free agency and pick up his player option to stay with the Cubs for $27.5 million in 2025. “It mostly just gives us clarity,” he added. “Now we know what our roster looks like, and now we can go about building a team. Before that, there was some uncertainty.” Hoyer’s sentiment is reasonable on its face and an understandable one to share publicly. But there are two issues. For one, Bellinger’s second season in Chicago brought into question just how good of a player he actually is. Bellinger practically reinvented himself as a hitter in his first year with the Cubs in 2023, drastically cutting down on his strikeouts in favor of a more high-contact approach. While he kept the strikeouts down in 2024, he provided far less power, with his SLG% dropping nearly 100 points, bringing his overall offensive contributions closer to league average. Arguably more pressing here is Bellinger’s fit defensively, as the two positions he has been known for playing brilliantly in his career — first base and center field — are occupied in Chicago by two ascendant core pieces in Michael Busch and Pete Crow-Armstrong. That means Bellinger currently projects as Chicago’s every-day right fielder, with Seiya Suzuki shifting to more of a primary DH role. While Suzuki’s bat is certainly good enough to produce like a high-level DH, Bellinger — especially at his salary — as strictly a right fielder is notably less appealing, particularly if his power production remains middling at best. Combine these two factors, and it’s unsurprising that Ken Rosenthal reported earlier this week that the Cubs are trying to trade Bellinger but are having a tough time doing so, due to both his uncertain outlook as a hitter and his contract status. Bellinger has another player option for $25M in 2026 that he could pick up next winter if he delivers another mediocre campaign, so committing to two more years of this lesser version of him is probably a tough pill for potential suitors to swallow. All of this might keep his trade value at a suboptimal level, to the point that dealing him away isn’t worth more than moving forward with him as the every-day right fielder and hoping he rediscovers some power production. Another way to look at Bellinger’s decision to opt in is how it might’ve impacted Chicago’s willingness to spend in free agency this winter. Which brings us to our next question … On a recent episode of Baseball Bar-B-Cast, ESPN insider J​​eff Passan mentioned that the sense in the industry is that the Cubs are not expected to be playing in the deepest waters of free agency this winter. Whether that is directly related to having Bellinger back in the fold at a significant salary number is undetermined, but even with Bellinger, the Cubs’ payroll is currently well below $200 million, according to Roster Resource — nowhere near the $241 million competitive balance tax line that most big-market behemoths have flirted with or blasted past in recent years. There is unquestionably room for another big-ticket addition in Chicago without needing to pay the luxury tax, if ownership demonstrates an appetite for it, but it remains to be seen if such an appetite exists. Early indications out of Boston — another massive market that has been more conservative with spending in recent years — portray a Red Sox team ready to spend aggressively and reassert itself as a premier franchise after several consecutive underwhelming seasons. One could argue that the Cubs should be acting in a similar fashion, considering their roster and recent history, but that’s not exactly the tone we’ve seen thus far. However, we’re still in the earliest stages of the offseason, and things can change quickly. If the Cubs are going to spend more than we currently anticipate, it seems likely that something will be done to address the pitching staff. On that note … Should the Cubs’ brass wake up someday soon with the ambition to chase the biggest names on the market, a pursuit of Corbin Burnes, Max Fried or Blake Snell would make plenty of sense — not to mention a run at Roki Sasaki, as quite literally every team should be making. But the Cubs proved last year with the smash-hit signing of Shota Imanaga that they can strike gold in the second tier of starting pitchers as well. In that realm, Sean Manaea and Nick Pivetta come with qualifying offers attached, but each offers substantial upside and won’t cost nine figures. The same goes for Walker Buehler, who could be a nice gamble on a shorter-term deal. Chicago also feels like an excellent landing spot for Shane Bieber, even if he won’t be ready to help right away next season. The bullpen is another avenue for the Cubs to make a significant splash in free agency. Chicago made a nifty trade with Cleveland earlier this week, dealing 20-year-old outfield prospect Alfonsin Rosario to acquire right-hander Eli Morgan, who was quietly excellent when called upon as one of the less-heralded members of the elite Guardians bullpen. Morgan will help, but there’s plenty more room for upgrades in this bullpen. Perhaps the Cubs stay away from top-tier starting pitchers in free agency and instead focus on landing one of the elite relief arms available, such as Tanner Scott, Jeff Hoffman or Clay Holmes. The bullpen market is also stocked with veteran types who could fortify this unit; Blake Treinen, Kirby Yates or even Kenley Jansen come to mind. The Cubs wouldn’t have to break the bank to land these types of arms and could realistically also add a mid-tier starter to seriously strengthen the entire pitching staff. With so much of the position-player group seemingly set — and with more help on the way — there’s no excuse for Chicago not to make several meaningful additions on the mound this winter. Let’s turn our attention back to the offensive side of things and contemplate the infield. The surprise acquisition of Isaac Paredes at the 2024 trade deadline made an already crowded depth chart even more difficult to project moving forward and prompted some intriguing possibilities entering this offseason. That would’ve been true even if Paredes had raked for the Cubs post-trade, but that’s practically the opposite of what happened, as he didn’t perform anywhere close to his potential in the second half. Still, Paredes is under team control through 2027, and it’s not like the Cubs got him for free; trading for him seemed to signal a real intention for him to be the third baseman in Chicago for the foreseeable future. Enter Matt Shaw. The Cubs’ first-round pick in 2023 out of the University of Maryland had a marvelous season in the minors, reaching Triple-A and excelling in 35 games to finish the season before he starred with Team USA in the Premier12 tournament. A shortstop in college, Shaw bounced around the infield in his first pro season but took the majority of his reps at third base, a position that seemed open in Chicago … until Paredes was acquired. We don’t know if Shaw is ready to contribute on Opening Day, but it’s not difficult to imagine a big spring training from the talented infielder creating pressure for him to crack the Cubs' roster out of camp. But where will he play? This is a good problem to have on paper, but it becomes more complicated if Paredes doesn’t bounce back. With Busch entrenched at first base after a strong rookie season and Swanson locked in at shortstop for the long haul, second baseman Nico Hoerner becomes an interesting character here as well. Hoerner is under team control for two more seasons and provides outstanding defense but a bat that has plateaued around league-average. If the Cubs deem Shaw ready sooner rather than later, might they consider dealing Hoerner to make room for Shaw at second? It’s awfully difficult to determine whether that’s a sensible strategy without knowing just how big-league-ready Shaw is or what version of Paredes the Cubs will get in 2025, but it’s certainly a path worth exploring — especially if teams are willing to pay a substantial price for Hoerner. Shaw isn’t the only prospect in the upper levels of Chicago’s system who could make a difference in the big leagues in the near future. As if the infield picture weren’t jam-packed enough, second baseman James Triantos — a wonderful defender with strong contact skills and plus wheels on the basepaths — also reached Triple-A in 2024 and could play his way into consideration next summer. Third baseman Cam Smith, Chicago’s first-round pick this past summer out of Florida State, collected more total bases than any other 2024 draftee after signing and finished the season in Double-A. He could be ready far sooner than anyone expected. Catcher Moises Ballesteros had a monster breakout season as a 20-year-old, hitting his way to Triple-A and finishing with a strong few weeks in the Arizona Fall League. But the recent acquisition of catcher Matt Thaiss from the Angels suggests that the Cubs might not be ready to lean on Ballesteros as the backup to incumbent Miguel Amaya too quickly, though it’s possible that his bat forces the issue at some point in 2025. Outfielder Owen Caissie was added to the 40-man roster this week and has massive raw power that was on display over a full season in Triple-A in 2024, but he’ll need to iron out some significant strikeout issues before getting the call to Chicago. Super-athletic 22-year-old Kevin Alcantara made his debut in the Cubs' outfield last summer after a much shorter stint in Triple-A, but he too will need to make more consistent contact to be considered a viable option in the short term. Caissie’s and Alcantara’s paths to playing time would’ve been much clearer had Bellinger opted out, but now each will need to prove his worth over a longer period of time in Triple-A to warrant consistent run at the big-league level. Not all of these players will end up making an impact in Chicago. But their proximity to the big leagues and prospect cachet are worth monitoring as the Cubs sort out their roster for 2025, especially in the context of possible trades this winter and next summer."

Prior to that, he spent one season at UConn as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach before moving to SMU to coach those same roles for Dykes. For most of his career as an assistant, Lashlee worked under Gus Malzahn, running his offense and coaching QBs at Arkansas State and Auburn.

He shouldn't have been. The relevant rule includes a catch-all provision that lists specific types of ""other delay of game fouls,"" including but not limited to ""spiking or throwing the ball in the field of play after a down has ended, except after a score"" and ""intentional contact with the football to delay the snap or the officials’ ability to make the ball ready for play."" Bishop knocked the ball out of receiver Jerry Jeudy's hands after a play. But Bishop seemed to believe there was a chance the play wasn't over. Jeudy made a catch and, apparently, wasn't touched after he hit the ground. He got up, and Bishop punched out the ball. While Jeudy might have been touched by a Steelers defender, it was close enough for Bishop to knock the ball free, just in case. It was a smart, head's-up play. The only problem is that it was more head's-up than the official, who by all appearances had his head up his butt. Common sense is all too often ignored by officials who get too caught up in the language of the rules. That tendency can make an official into, as Marv Levy once said, an ""over-officious jerk."""
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Franz Wagner feeling himself against the Lakers? A dangerous development for all Magic foes,https://sports.yahoo.com/franz-wagner-feeling-himself-against-the-lakers-a-dangerous-development-for-all-magic-foes-184215599.html,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:42:15 GMT",Orlando's 23-year-old forward is performing like one of the best players in the NBA thus far this season.,"What stands out, in context, is the confidence. Down two, 18.9 seconds left, under the bright lights in L.A. Anthony Davis, a 79.5% career free-throw shooter who’d canned 10 of his first 11 at the stripe through the first 47 minutes of Magic-Lakers, bricks a pair to give Orlando a chance to tie — or, perhaps, if you’re feeling yourself on the road, to go for the win. And these days? Brother, Franz Wagner is feeling himself. Wagner calls guard Jalen Suggs up for the ball screen, getting Davis to give up the switch and allowing him to go one-on-one against Cam Reddish — still a big, long-limbed, athletic defender, but not nearly on the level of AD, and also, crucially, a couple of inches shorter than Franz himself. Rhythm dribble, tween-tween, straight to the stepback — no hesitation, no second-guessing, and no doubt. He cashes out. Magic lead. And, one stop later: Magic win. Wagner made 41 stepback 3-pointers in his first 231 games across three NBA seasons, shooting 33.1% on those high-wire-act, long-range looks. When Wagner dotted Reddish’s eye on Thursday, it was his 10th in 23 tries (43.5%) across 17 games this season — the most consequential and loudest, and one that highlights the hurdle that he’s had to leap. The German forward entered the summer with a bitter taste in his mouth. On one hand, he’d put together his strongest season as a pro, averaging 19.7 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game for a pleasant-surprise Magic team that won 47 games and made the playoffs for the first time in four years. On the other, he’d ended the campaign with a whimper, capping a season-long shooting slump — just 28.1% from 3-point land, the worst long-distance mark among 181 players who launched at least 200 long balls — by going 1-for-15 from the field and 0-for-5 from deep in Game 7 of Orlando’s opening-round loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. The downward spiral from distance continued at the 2024 Paris Olympics. While Wagner played a starring role for his country, averaging a team-high 18.5 points per game and helping lead Germany to the semifinals and ultimately a fourth-place finish, he made just seven of his 35 attempts from the shorter FIBA 3-point arc. The consistent inconsistency left the status of his janky jumper — one that had gone in at about a league-average clip through his rookie and sophomore seasons — looming as one of the biggest questions for a Magic team in desperate need of more shot-making and offensive firepower. That need became even more desperate on Halloween, when Wagner’s All-Star frontcourt partner Paolo Banchero, fresh off a breakout 50-point performance, was diagnosed with a torn oblique that would put him on the shelf for the foreseeable future. Suddenly, doubt was a luxury Orlando could not afford; for the Magic to stay afloat without their leader in points, assists, touches and time of possession, Wagner would have to trust in the hours of work he’d put in over the summer to make his weakness into a strength, and step forward into the spotlight that his patient, poised, effective-but-minor-key game doesn’t always receive. Well, judging by the 37 points he just hung on the Lakers — Wagner’s fourth 30-plus-point explosion of the season, after rolling up 11 through his first three seasons — to go with 11 rebounds, six assists and four steals? So far, so good: The Magic have now won seven of their last eight, with the best point differential in the NBA over that span. (A friendly schedule has helped: Orlando swept a five-game homestand featuring visits from the injury-ravaged Pelicans and 76ers, the disappointing Pacers and the basement-dwelling Wizards, before going on the road to take down a Suns team missing Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal and Jusuf Nurkić.) As has been the case ever since Jamahl Mosley took the reins in Central Florida, Orlando’s defense leads the way, smothering opponents to the tune of a league-low 102.2 points per 100 non-garbage-time possessions during this stretch. But Mosley’s club has also featured a near-top-10 offense, despite missing Banchero, and despite four of the six Orlando players logging at least 25 minutes a night over the past couple of weeks — Suggs, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Anthony Black and rookie Tristan da Silva — combining to shoot a grisly 39-for-146 (26.7%) from deep. Wagner has been the beating heart of that offense, averaging 28.1 points, 6.0 rebounds and 6.9 assists in 35.4 minutes a night over the last eight games, posting a .587 true shooting percentage (which factors in 2-point, 3-point and free-throw accuracy) while finishing more than 31% of Orlando’s offensive possessions with a shot attempt, foul drawn or turnover. That is a superstar-level combination of usage, efficiency and production, arrived at only by stacking possession after possession of hard drives to the paint, pristine footwork and expert leveraging of angles, soft-touch floaters and on-target passes in teammates’ shooting pockets … and, as he showed by drilling four triples in 10 tries on Thursday, the confidence to keep firing. “A lot of stuff is mental, too, for us players,” Wagner told reporters after Thursday’s win. “For me to get over the hump a little bit over the summer and carry that into the season means a lot. I’ve come a long way since I came into the league, [but] last year was at times a struggle for me. Progress is never just linear; you just gotta stay level-headed.” While Wagner himself needs to stay on an even keel, the results he’s producing can lead your mind to wander — and to wonder just how good he and the Magic can be. All told, Wagner is averaging 23.2 points, 5.6 rebounds and 5.4 assists in 31.9 minutes per game for the season, back up to 35% from long range on a career-high 6.1 attempts per game. He’s one of 13 players averaging at least 23-5-5 this season — a list that includes four MVPs (Nikola Jokić, Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, Stephen Curry), four All-NBA selections (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jayson Tatum, Luka Dončić, De’Aaron Fox) and two All-Stars (teammate Banchero, Brandon Ingram). He pairs that impressive box-score production with a sterling advanced statistical résumé: third in the NBA in wins above replacement according to Neil Paine’s Estimated RAPTOR, fifth in The BBall Index’s LEBRON metric, ninth in value over replacement player, 15th in box plus-minus, 18th in player efficiency rating, and 24th in win shares per 48 minutes. It all points toward the 23-year-old performing like one of the 15 or 20 best players in the NBA thus far this season. Combine that with the role he’s played in keeping the Magic above .500 without Banchero, and thus above the fray in what looks like a truly haunted Eastern Conference, and you’ve got an awfully impressive start to an All-Star case — a gifted player bouncing back from a brush with failure, putting it all together, and putting his team in position to reap the benefits. This time last year, Wagner told Jake Fischer that “the worst thing would be to look back and think I didn’t get the most out of myself.” If he keeps this up, he won’t have to worry much about that. Defenses, on the other hand? They’re going to have a lot to fret over; just ask Cam Reddish, JJ Redick and every other Laker who got an up-close look at how dangerous a confident Wagner can be."

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fact or Fiction: The NBA's 2024 free-agency class was a dud,https://sports.yahoo.com/fact-or-fiction-the-nbas-2024-free-agency-class-was-a-dud-175638573.html,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 17:56:38 GMT",Let's take a deeper dive to see if teams are salvaging some value from their underwhelming offseason signings.,"Each week during the 2024-25 NBA season, we will take a deeper dive into some of the league’s biggest storylines in an attempt to determine whether trends are based more in fact or fiction moving forward. [Last week: The NBA needs more 3-point specialists] No team spent more on salary this past summer than the Philadelphia 76ers, who own the NBA's worst record through the season's first month — indirect evidence that the 2024 free-agency class was a bust. Let us dive deeper into that question to see if teams managed to salvage some value. First a reintroduction to Cost Per Win (CPW), a statistic created here in 2016 to measure the cost of each player's contributions to a team's success in a given season: We take the average annual value (AAV) of a player's contract, divide it by that player's win shares (WS) and extrapolate the data out to a full season. This provides us with an estimated account of how much teams are paying their players for each victory. We separated the 56 free agents who changed teams over the summer into four categories: big-ticket ($12,859,001+), mid-tier ($5,183,000-$12,859,000), low-cost ($1,157,153-$5,182,999) and two-way players. It is harder to equate value across tiers. Teams expect to pay more per win for max-salaried players. Usage varies. Roles are different. Minimum-salaried players do not stabilize organizations. In fact, the addition of a high-priced free agent has been known to attract lower-cost ones, as was the case in Philadelphia. PLAYER AAV WS CPW 1. DeMar DeRozan, SAC $24,630,000 1.5 $3,003,659 2. Klay Thompson, DAL $16,666,667 0.7 $4,355,401 3. Tobias Harris, DET $26,000,000 1.1 $4,900,222 4. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, ORL $22,000,000 0.7 $6,132,404 5. Isaiah Hartenstein, OKC $29,000,000 0.1 $56,585,366 6. Paul George, PHI $52,896,235 0.1 $90,310,645 Eighty-eight players have registered at least a single win share through the season's first month, and just two of them — Sacramento Kings standout DeMar DeRozan and Detroit Pistons forward Tobias Harris — were big-ticket acquisitions in free agency. And who else was bidding for DeRozan or Harris? Granted, Isaiah Hartenstein made his season debut for the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, the same day Paul George hyperextended his left knee for the second time in five weeks. We should expect then that Harris has made a greater impact on the Pistons than George has on the Philadelphia 76ers, though that is no less disheartening for the Sixers fans who rode Harris out of town. Pause to consider how concerning the signing of George — the most skilled player in a shallow pool of big-ticket free agents — could be for Philly. He is the only player still active from the 2010 draft class, and he has played more than 56 games once in the past five years, his contract season. He has had major injuries to every one of his extremities, and will be paid $56.6 million in 2028, when he turns 38 years old. It does not help that maximum-salaried teammates Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey cannot stay on the court, either. At some point the three of them will play sustained minutes together. Presumably they will win games. But it bears repeating: The 76ers have so far paid George $9 million to contribute one-tenth of a win share. PLAYER AAV WS CPW 1.

We also had 88 games of film on Kris Dunn in Utah, where he was his usual All-Defensive-caliber self and added a 3-point shot (40% on 147 attempts). Imagine not lining up for those services on short money. Yet the L.A. Clippers landed him on July 1 for the taxpayer's midlevel exception. Pays to be early — and right. Same goes for Naji Marshall, a hard-scrapping wing whose 3-point shooting spiked to a career-high 38.7% last season. That has dipped to 13% in this season's early going, but the Dallas Mavericks should be encouraged that he is still generating significant value as they wait for his shot to progress to the mean. Chris Paul, Buddy Hield, Malik Beasley, Jonas Valanciunas and Derrick Jones Jr. were known commodities when they entered free agency, and they are delivering on their promise for mid-tier salaries. They are all on pace for a handful of win shares this season, what Sixth Man of the Year Naz Reid provided for the Minnesota Timberwolves last season. In other words, $2 million a win is good value for a mid-tier salary. PLAYER AAV WS CPW 1. Jay Huff, MEM $2,527,660 1.1 $448,365 2. Tyus Jones, PHX $3,003,427 1.2 $488,362 3.

Monte Morris, PHX $2,800,834 0.3 $1,821,681 The Memphis Grizzlies signed Jay Huff to a two-way contract in July, and a week into this season they upgraded him to a fully guaranteed salary for the next two years. He has more than earned that deal. We should not be surprised that Tyus Jones appears on this list. His minimum salary was a gift to the Phoenix Suns, as he prioritized a considerable role to showcase his real value for the summer of 2025. And, hey, at least the Sixers found some value on this salary tier, landing Guerschon Yabusele, whose value was evident to anyone who watched him perform against Team USA at the Olympics in Paris. It is hard to make a grave mistake at this level of compensation. Unfortunately, the Sixers also have Eric Gordon and his -0.2 win shares. But we should go back to the Clippers, whose first order of business in free agency was to sign Kevin Porter Jr. to a minimum contract. His -0.3 win shares are the fewest of anyone who has played as many minutes as he has (275). The Clippers are paying Porter to make their team worse, and that is nothing any team wants, especially from this player. How could the Clippers be so accurate in their assessment of one player and so mistaken on another? Makes you wonder how much luck plays a part in the single-season success of minimum-paid players. Adding Jones at that salary is a no-brainer. But you do not know what you are going to get year-to-year from guys like Taurean Prince, Cameron Payne, Javonte Green and Mason Plumlee. Hope for their best. PLAYER AAV WS CPW 1. Moussa Diabate, CHA $578,577 0.7 $151,196 2. Jamal Cain, NOP $578,577 0.2 $564,465 3. TyTy Washington, PHX $578,577 0.1 $1,128,931 4. JT Thor, CLE $578,577 0.1 $1,199,489 Which brings us to the two-way crew. Any contributions at that tier are valuable. A second to praise Moussa Diabaté. The Clippers — yes, those same Clippers — declined his $2.1 million qualifying offer, making an athletic 6-foot-11 rim protector a free agent. No one offered the minimum. The Charlotte Hornets took a two-way flier, and he is owning his 16 minutes a night. He is efficient in his limited offensive possessions, rebounds like wild (16.3 per 36 minutes) and holds opponents in check. Overall, the big-ticket free agents were a dud, the mid-tier free agents are middling, and the real value was among the low-cost free agents. And even then there are few difference-makers. The question is not whether the 2024 free-agency class was a dud but if free agency itself is dying as a team-building tool. Determination: Fact. The NBA's 2024 free-agency class was a dud."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football: Week 12 predictions to count on,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-week-12-predictions-to-count-on-162733318.html,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 16:27:33 GMT",The Yahoo Fantasy Football team comes together to deliver their conviction picks for Week 12.,"The Yahoo team delivers their most steadfast predictions for Week 12. It’s Week 12 and Bo Nix might be the most trustworthy rookie quarterback in the league. Since Week 5, Nix has scored a minimum of 14 fantasy points in every game, finished inside the top 12 five times and thrown just two interceptions. Combine the much-improved passing with his rushing upside and you have an incredibly stable quarterback with high upside and limited risk. Nix has thrived in a wide range of matchups, from dominating layup defenses like Carolina to delivering a solid performance in tough matchups like Kansas City. He’s simply getting it done. This week, he faces a favorable matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders, who allow the eighth-most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks. Nix has legitimate overall QB1 upside this week. — Tera Roberts Irving finds himself in a great matchup as he comes out of his bye week. He’ll take on a Giants defense that allows the most rushing yards per play this season, according to NFL Pro. But it gets even better because Irving and the Bucs are five-point favorites against the Tommy DeVito-led Giants offense. There’s a good chance the Bucs play with a lead in the second half which could lead to even more rush attempts for Irving. The Giants also allow the third most explosive runs of 10+ yards this season. This matters because Irving is one of the most dynamic backs in the NFL. He’s averaging nearly six yards per touch this season and generating an explosive play on 11% of his touches, which is similar to Saquon Barkley’s explosive play rate of 12%. Irving is a must-start this week and has the upside to finish as a top-five back. — Sal Vetri First of all, I must say that Sal simply beat me to Bucky Irving, who is going to do such terrible things to the Giants defense. But hey, I’m a professional. Irving isn’t the only player I’m bullish on this week. Justin Herbert is playing at an undeniably elite level and he is about to cook the Ravens D, which has of course allowed the most passing yards per game this season (284.5). In fact, an overall QB1 finish is definitely in play for Herbert. He’s thrown only one interception on the year and has produced career-best rates in terms of yards per attempt (7.9) and per completion (12.4). Ladd McConkey has been a ridiculous problem for opposing defenses to solve and no team can keep Quentin Johnston out of the end zone. There’s actually a decent chance that Monday night’s game delivers the two highest-scoring fantasy quarterbacks of Week 12, so let’s hope you have plenty of Ravens and Bolts in the active lineup. — Andy Behrens Robinson saw 17 opportunities during his return last week, including a goal-line score. He ranks top 10 in rushing TDs (seven) this season despite missing three games thanks to heavy red-zone work. Robinson is off the injury report this week, so hopefully he’s closer to 100%. The Cowboys have been gashed for NFL highs in EPA/rush and rushing touchdowns while allowing the third most fantasy points to running backs. Washington has this week’s second-highest implied team total (28.5 points) and is a double-digit home favorite against a reeling Cowboys team, so game script should be highly favorable. Robinson has averaged 5.5 YPC at home this season, so he finishes as a top-10 back this week. — Dalton Del Don As Tera highlighted above, Bo Nix has played great football of late. The stats aren’t lying; he’s executing a well-designed offense at a high level. But he’s really only bringing one player along for the ride from a fantasy perspective. Since Week 8, Cortland Sutton is the only Broncos player to run a route on more than 60% of Nix’s dropbacks. He’s dominating the volume with a 29% target share and 46% air yard share. Sutton is entrenched as the X-receiver in this offense and he’s always been a strong fit for what Sean Payton wants out of that position. Now, he’s operating with a quarterback who has a substantial overlap with his skills beyond the right coverage receptions. Sutton gets a matchup with a Raiders defense that allows the type of vertical targets on which Nix and Sutton have developed some serious chemistry. With so many proven receivers on bye, Sutton is a locked-in top-15 option. — Matt Harmon I know the vibes are usually positive in this column, but you also need to know who to bench (and maybe who to cut). Jaylen Waddle managers need to have a conversation. He’s stuck on one touchdown all year and hasn’t seen 60 yards since Opening Day. When does a bad start become a bad season? We’re almost to Thanksgiving, gamers. The Patriots secondary is competitive and it’s clear the Dolphins are looking more to manage Tua Tagovailoa these days, not utilize him as a deep-throwing maestro. Waddle has a capped upside entering Week 12 and not only should you bench him, but he’s a justified cut in some smaller leagues. — Scott Pianowski"
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Tee Higgins to Patriots? Here are the top WRs set to hit free agency,https://sports.yahoo.com/tee-higgins-patriots-top-wrs-201919218.html,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 23:09:31 GMT",The Patriots need to surround their rookie QB Drake Maye with playmakers this offseason. Here are the top wide receiver options for New England in free agency.,"Tee Higgins to Patriots? Here are the top WRs set to hit free agency originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston The New England Patriots appear to have found their next franchise quarterback in Drake Maye. Now, they must find their prized third-overall draft pick with playmakers. New England's wide receiver room remains a massive weakness even after addressing the position in the 2024 draft. While second-rounder Ja'Lynn Polk and fourth-rounder Javon Baker could still develop into impactful players, their rookie campaigns have left plenty to be desired. The Patriots stayed quiet at the NFL trade deadline, so they'll have to wait until the offseason to make the necessary improvements to their offense. According to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, they are expected to be active on the free-agent market to find help for their promising young signal-caller. ""The Patriots are disappointed in the offensive line and receiver play but feel they have several players to help the cause in 2025 and beyond,"" Fowler wrote in his Week 12 column. ... ""And Maye's play has energized the building. The Pats hit on the most important position. Expect New England, once again, to work free agency for pass-catching and offensive line help to maximize Maye's impact. That's an encouraging update, but are any impending free agents capable of being Maye's No. 1 target for years to come? Let's take a look at the top wideouts set to hit the open market. . . Age: 26 At only 26 years old, Higgins is unquestionably the most intriguing option on this list for the rebuilding Patriots. The Cincinnati Bengals are expected to let the Clemson product walk in free agency, opening up a perfect opportunity for him to become Maye's new No. 1 target. BURROW TO HIGGINS. BENGALS NOT DONE.📺: #CINvsLAC on NBC/Peacock📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/HNgJW672DJ — NFL (@NFL) November 18, 2024 Higgins has been hampered by injuries over the last two seasons, but when healthy, he has been among the league's most productive receivers. He has 295 catches for 4,173 yards and 28 touchdowns in 64 games played over five seasons with Cincy. With several teams sure to be looking for receiver help, Higgins will cost a pretty penny. Still, with such a glaring need at the position, there's no reason the Patriots shouldn't be among the highest bidders for his services. Age: 30 Diggs' name jumps off the page because he's been one of the NFL's top wideouts for almost a decade. However, the four-time Pro Bowler suffered a torn ACL in October and as he reaches his 30s, his best days are likely behind him. The argument for signing Diggs? He had six consecutive seasons with more than 1,000 receiving yards and was on track to eclipse that mark again with the Houston Texans prior to his injury. Since he's damaged goods, his price should be lower than the other options on this list. That said, Diggs' age and injury make him an imperfect fit for a team building around a rookie QB. Unfortunately for New England, most of the names on this list are either injury prone or past their primes. Age: 33 The Chicago Bears added Allen and DJ Moore in hopes that they would revive their offense with No. 1 draft pick Caleb Williams throwing them the ball. Those moves haven't paid off as the group remains dysfunctional heading into Week 12. Allen has 30 catches for 282 yards and two touchdowns in eight games played this season. Last year with the Los Angeles Chargers, he notched 108 catches for 1,243 yards and seven TDs in 13 games. Third touchdown of the day for Caleb 🎯📺: #JAXvsCHI on NFL Network📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/lbzlBQi4rh — NFL (@NFL) October 13, 2024 Like Diggs, Allen is an elite talent with injury concerns. And as great as he was in 2023, it's fair to say the six-time Pro Bowler is approaching the tail end of his NFL career. Age: 31 When Cooper signs this upcoming offseason, it could be with his fourth team since 2021. The five-time Pro Bowler has played for the Dallas Cowboys, Cleveland Browns, and the Buffalo Bills in that span. Cooper was traded from Cleveland to Buffalo before this year's deadline. Between poor QB play and injury, it's been a rough season for the veteran wideout. However, Cooper entered the campaign with at least 1,114 yards in four of his last five seasons. There's plenty still left in the tank, and he'd be a reliable option for Maye to lean on in his first full season as the Patriots' starting quarterback. Age: 29 Godwin's 2024 season ended prematurely due to a devastating ankle injury. Before he went down, he was well on his way to his fifth 1,000-plus-yard season in six years. He's been one of the most consistent wideouts in the game when healthy. His injury shouldn't dissuade teams from signing him. Godwin has come back strong from a season-ending injury before as he tore his ACL and MCL in 2021. He'll be just 29 years old next season, making him one of the youngest wideouts among the top options in this year's class. Age: 33 Hopkins' days as arguably the best wide receiver in football are over, but he's still a rock-solid option as he approaches his mid-30s. The three-time All-Pro selection produced a 1,057-yard, seven-touchdown season with the lowly Tennessee Titans in 2023. He hasn't enjoyed the same success through 10 games with the Titans and Kansas City Chiefs this year, but that's largely due to the poor QB play he had to endure in Tennessee. The Patriots lost the Hopkins sweepstakes in the 2022 offseason. Perhaps the opportunity to work with a promising young QB could entice him to sign next spring. Age: 29 Johnson was traded to the Carolina Panthers last offseason after five solid years with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was traded again ahead of the deadline to the Baltimore Ravens. He led the Panthers with 30 catches, 357 yards, and three TDs before being shipped to Baltimore, where he's been a non-factor through his first three games with the team. While Johnson would immediately slot in as the Patriots' top wideout, New England probably should aim higher if it wants a bonafide No. 1 option. Age: 28 Brown has yet to play this season for the Chiefs due to injury. Last season with the Arizona Cardinals, he recorded 51 catches for 574 yards (a career-low) and four touchdowns. His best season was his 2021 campaign with the Ravens, when he logged 91 receptions for 1,008 yards and six TDs. While his injury is concerning, Brown's speed makes him an intriguing wideout to pair with a strong-armed QB. He is also likely to be one of the more affordable options on this list, though the Patriots shouldn't be pinching pennies in their efforts to upgrade their offense."

If you like what you see, you can subscribe for free here. Start-sit questions can be anxious for even the best fantasy managers. Here's a traffic-light report to help get you ready for Week 12. He's been the best runner in the Tampa Bay backfield, averaging 1.3 yards more per rush than Rachaad White. Running lanes should be available against a Giants front seven that gives out 5.3 YPC, worst in the NFL.‌ The Chargers slightly prefer the run but it's a small gap; Justin Herbert's play has improved in recent weeks. Johnston is coming along for the ride (touchdowns in three straight games) and the injury-wrecked Baltimore secondary doesn't offer much resistance. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. In the early weeks, he was an athletic quarterback who ran plenty and occasionally hit a few passes. His passing efficiency has improved significantly. Over his last seven starts, Nix has a tidy 7.4 YPA and a rating of 106.2 The Philadelphia defense is surging but so is Stafford; since getting his two main receivers back four games ago, he's averaging 2.5 touchdown passes and 291 passing yards per week. I don't understand why he isn't universally ranked over Deebo Samuel Sr. yet; he keeps outproducing him every week. Remember: in our game, it's the numbers, not the names. Is the nagging rib injury suffocating him as a runner? He has just 23 rushing yards the last two weeks, logging a pair of QB24 finishes. The Cowboys are a favorable draw, but Washington might not press the pace for a full three hours. Detroit's defense has turned into a problem, but Richardson got his groove back in the comeback win over the Jets and offers a useful rushing backboard in any start.‌ Maybe the Tommy DeVito move sounds like a downgrade, but keep in mind how poorly Daniel Jones was playing. The Giants are likely to pepper Nabers after their bye week, and the Tampa Bay secondary has been a mess all year. Not a chance I'm benching Nabers anywhere. I think the presence of Jonathon Brooks is an overrated angle; yes, Brooks was an early pick, but don't overlook the contract extension Hubbard earned. The biggest problem is the Chiefs rushing defense, the worst matchup for opposing backs in 2024. He might not be needed for four periods if the Commanders gain control of the game, but Ekeler is essentially the No. 2 receiver in Washington, scoring double-digit points in three straight, including an eight-catch gem against Philadelphia last week. He's probably a safe bet for 4-6 catches if Jake Ferguson is scratched as expected. It's also possible CeeDee Lamb could be limited, or perhaps out completely. Tight end is such a tricky position; we'll take what we can get. He hasn't been better than QB14 in seven weeks, in part because Joe Mixon is the touchdown priority at the goal line. Tennessee isn't the easy matchup you might suspect, ranked a respectable 11th in defensive DVOA. He's stuck on three touchdowns for the year and he's averaged less than 10 yards per catch in eight of 10 games. Rome Odunze might be the better offensive fit as the Bears ride out the year with new OC Thomas Brown. The Dolphins have TE Jonnu Smith unlocked and Tyreek Hill is too good to bench, but Waddle is a harder pill to swallow. He's scored just one touchdown all year and hasn't made it to 60 yards since opening day. In shallow formats, you have my permission to drop Waddle. His role shrunk last week with Isaiah Likely back and the Chargers' seam coverage has been outstanding all year."

I’ve enjoyed my stay at Inter Miami and will treasure the memories made and relationships forged here for the rest of my life. I depart with nothing but gratitude for my time here and would like to offer sincere thanks to everyone that made it possible,” said Martino in a statement. Martino led the team to a record-breaking regular season finish in 2024, with Miami earning the Supporters' Shield with 74 points. But the club followed it up with a poor performance in the MLS playoffs, crashing out of the first round after losses against Atlanta United. According to multiple reports, Javier Mascherano is set to replace Martino. Mascherano is a former international teammate of Lionel Messi with Argentina and played with Messi for eight seasons at Barcelona. Martino became head coach of Inter Miami in June 2023, and oversaw the acquisition not only of Messi, but the other excellent players brought in to build a team around him. The team brought on three of Messi's former Barcelona teammates in Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and Luis Suárez, while also rearranging salaries to bring in a number of key young players. Prior to joining Inter Miami in 2023, Martino coached at a variety of places, including Barcelona and the Argentina national team. The Argentine manager also led Atlanta to an MLS Cup victory in 2018, earning MLS Coach of the Year. Martino's departure will mark a massive shift for a team that already has a lot to figure out in the offseason. Inter Miami will now have to find a new coach ahead of 2025, a year that is set to be eventful for the club: In addition to the 2025 MLS season, Inter Miami will also be competing in the FIFA Club World Cup after (somewhat controversially) securing a spot with the 2024 regular season title."

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",St. Petersburg city council reverses course on Tampa Bay Rays' stadium repairs,https://sports.yahoo.com/st-petersburg-city-council-reverses-course-on-tampa-bay-rays-stadium-repairs-153321167.html,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:33:21 GMT",The Rays have already announced they will play their 2025 home games at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa.,"Hours after the St. Petersburg City Council approved spending $23.7 million to repair Tropicana Field after it was damaged during Hurricane Milton, the council reversed its decision in a second vote. The change of course came after the council voted to ""delay consideration of revenue bonds for a proposed new $1.3 billion Rays ballpark,"" according to the Associated Press. There was hope from the city that a new roof and additional repairs would allow the Rays to return to Tropicana Field for the 2026 season. The team has an obligation, should the stadium get fixed, to play there for three more seasons. The main damage to Tropicana Field was to the fabric roof panels, which were essentially ripped off when the storm made landfall. Eighteen of the 24 panels failed due to Hurricane Milton's high winds, and the failure of the roof allowed rain and wind to cause more damage inside the stadium. Team president Brian Auld told reporters after the initial vote that the team isn't sure planned repairs would be done on time. That would be a headache for the Rays, as a contingency plan would need to be in place for another home location, requiring more funds. “Our certainty is actually greater if the decision is made not to repair Tropicana Field, because I don’t believe we’re going to have a firm answer on whether it can be done for a very long time,” Auld said. “Based on the conversations we’ve had with our engineers, I believe we’re looking at a ‘26 situation where the city is trying to have the stadium ready, and we have to make alternative plans, and all the costs that come with that, that is actually more problematic for us. That’s why we’ve been working on trying to get to a settlement.” The Rays have already announced that any repairs would not be finished before the start of the 2025 MLB season, and they will play home games at Tampa's Steinbrenner Field, the minor-league complex and spring training home of the New York Yankees. As all parties involved continue the work, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred is open to giving everyone involved enough time to figure out a solution. “We’re committed to the fans in Tampa Bay,” Manfred said at the recent owners meeting. “Given all that’s happened in that market, we’re focused on our franchise in Tampa Bay right now.”"
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Caitlin Clark fans disappointed by WNBA star’s decision to turn down $1 million offer,https://sports.yahoo.com/caitlin-clark-fans-disappointed-wnba-164043988.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 16:40:43 GMT",Clark was almost unanimously named Rookie of the Year during her WNBA season this year,"Caitlin Clark will not be participating in the new women’s basketball league Unrivaled. The league was founded by WNBA players, Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier with the goal of competing in a 3-on-3 format during the offseason, so players can continue to improve their skills and make the “highest salaries in professional women’s sports league history.” Normally WBNA players compete overseas during the offseason in order to maintain an income. In a 22-minute livestream on November 20, the six teams’ rosters and coaching assignments were announced with the noticeable absence of the Indiana Fever guard. At the time, 34 out of 36 available spots were revealed featuring big names in women’s basketball including Angel Reese and Brittney Griner, but fans were upset that Clark wasn’t among them. However, ESPN recently reported that Clark was invited to join the league with a $1 million offer, which she turned down. The invitation will still be available to her if she does decide to change her mind, the sports publication reported. The Independent has contacted Clark’s representative for comment. When Clark first signed with the Fever her contract had her receiving $338,056 over the course of four years. She earned $76,535 in her rookie season and is projected to earn an annual salary of $97,582 by the end of her four-year contract. Clark has also been able to keep many of the sponsorships that she had in college such as State Farm and also earn some new ones. In April, she signed a deal with Nike worth over $20 million including the release of a signature shoe. Since the end of Clark’s rookie season with the Fever she remained uncommitted to any opportunities, telling ESPN, “We’ll see” in regards to playing in Stewart and Collier’s league. “I don’t know. Just taking it as it goes, and see if I want to play eventually.” Clark also went on to win the Rookie of the Year award for her accomplishments throughout the season as she received 66 out of 67 votes from a national panel of sportswriters and sportscasters. The WNBA player was also the number one draft pick following her time playing for the University of Iowa. She averaged 19.2 points and a league-best 8.4 assists per game while helping the WNBA set attendance records and garner mainstream attention. Clark led her team to the playoffs and a 20-20 record after a 1-8 start. Clark was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for August, was Player of the Week three times, and Rookie of the Month four times. She recorded the first two triple-doubles by a rookie in WNBA history, set a league single-game record with 19 assists, and became the first rookie to have at least 30 points and 10 assists in a game. Back in June, Clark was shockingly not selected to compete for Team USA in the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics. Clark said at the time that this gave her a new goal to work toward. “I think it just gives you something to work for,” she said. “It’s a dream. Hopefully one day I can be there. I think it’s just a little more motivation. You remember that. Hopefully, when four years comes back around [at the LA Olympics in 2028], I can be there.”"
"Yahoo!

Joe Gibbs Racing announced Friday that Chris Gabehart would become the team’s competition director and that Chris Gayle would become Hamlin’s crew chief. Gabehart had been Hamlin’s crew chief since the start of the 2019 season and the two had formed one of the most successful driver-crew chief pairings in NASCAR. Over the past six seasons, Hamlin won 23 races and never finished lower than eighth in the standings. Hamlin won 13 races in their first two seasons together but finished fourth in the standings each season. The 44-year-old is the most successful driver in NASCAR Cup Series history without a Cup title. Hamlin has 54 wins and three Daytona 500 victories, but he’s only finished second in the points standings once. In 2024, Hamlin won three times and had 18 top 10s but was eliminated from the playoffs in the penultimate race of the season at Martinsville. He ended up finishing eighth in the standings after an 11th-place finish at Phoenix. Gayle has been Ty Gibbs’ crew chief at JGR for the past two seasons. A longtime JGR crew chief, Gayle has worked with the team in various capacities since the 2013 season. He was Erik Jones’ crew chief on the No. 20 car from 2017-2020. Gayle served as Gibbs’ crew chief in the Xfinity Series in 2022 as Gibbs won seven races and the Xfinity Series title. Jones has two Cup Series wins with Gayle as drivers have scored 37 wins in the Xfinity Series on Gayle’s teams. No crew chief for Gibbs for the 2025 season was announced."

Sign up here to get it every weekday morning. 🏈 Top QBs commit: Five-star QBs Julian Lewis and Bryce Underwood both flipped their commitments on Thursday, with Lewis heading to Colorado (originally USC) and Underwood going to Michigan (LSU). ⚾️ Robo-umps coming soon? MLB will test the robo-umpire challenge system during spring training, which could lead to regular-season implementation by 2026. 🏒 Ovi out 4-6 weeks: Alex Ovechkin, who leads the NHL with 15 goals, will miss 4-6 weeks with a fractured fibula, putting his Wayne Gretzky chase (27 goals shy of the all-time record) on hold. 🏈 Kraft denied again: Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who has made a concerted push in recent years to be enshrined in Canton, was passed over by the Hall of Fame's contributor committee. ⚽️ MLS record transfer: FC Cincinnati signed forward Kévin Denkey from Cercle Brugge (Belgium) for a $16.2 million fee, making it the largest transfer in MLS history. No. 5 Indiana visits No. 2 Ohio State on Saturday in a clash no one saw coming — and a matchup, as one might describe it, between major college football's biggest historical loser and its biggest historical winner. From Yahoo Sports' Dan Wetzel: ""Hoosiers"" — the tale of a tiny high school winning the state basketball tournament — is the greatest underdog story ever told out of Indiana. Yet as much as little Hickory High was an unlikely champion, it wasn't completely improbable. The sweet shooting Jimmy Chitwood, after all, was the equivalent of a 5-star talent. He just happened to grow up on a nearby farm. Not even mighty South Bend Central had an answer for him. The current Indiana football team — full of discount coaches and outcast players almost no major program wanted — has no one as heralded as Chitwood. But the new Hoosiers never stopped believing they were good enough, never stopped working to prove it and now have the opportunity to throw their best punch at the mighty Buckeyes. Hollywood endings are hard to find in real life — so who knows what happens in Columbus, let alone beyond. Ohio State is a nearly two-touchdown favorite for a reason. But the fact IU is even here … is a testament to all that is great about sports. Recruiting rankings and preseason perception don't move the scoreboard. Fight and work and self-determination can still win out. After all, the field inside Ohio Stadium is 100 yards long. They'll find this exact same measurement back in Bloomington. Further reading: Forever a basketball school, Curt Cignetti has awakened a 'sleeping giant' of a football program at Indiana (Ross Dellenger, Yahoo Sports) Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani were named unanimous MVPs on Wednesday, a fitting end to their epic 2024 campaigns. Judge, who led MLB with 58 HR, 144 RBI and an 1.159 OPS, beat out Royals SS Bobby Witt Jr. and teammate Juan Soto for his second MVP. He joins Mickey Mantle as the only Yankees to win the award unanimously. Ohtani, whose 54 HR, 130 RBI and 1.036 OPS trailed only Judge, beat out Mets SS Francisco Lindor and D-Backs 2B Ketel Marte for his third MVP in four years. He joins Frank Robinson as the only players to win the award in both the AL and NL. Multi-time MVPs: Judge is the 34th player to win multiple MVPs and Ohtani is the 12th to win at least three, joining Barry Bonds (7x) and three-time winners Mike Trout, Albert Pujols, Alex Rodriguez, Mike Schmidt, Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Roy Campanella, Stan Musial, Joe DiMaggio and Jimmie Foxx. The big picture: Getting to watch even one player of Judge and Ohtani's caliber is a treat, but seeing two play at this high a level simultaneously is downright historic: They're just the fourth duo to each win two MVPs in the same three-year span. Judge and Ohtani (2022-24) Bonds and Rodriguez (2003-05) Bonds and Frank Thomas (1992-94) Berra and Campanella (1953-55) Zoom out: Their dominance extends far beyond the past three seasons. Since 2018 (Ohtani's rookie year and Judge's second full season), they both rank in MLB's top five for HR, OPS and WAR. And Ohtani also has the 11th-best ERA among starters in that time. Cleveland — We got our first snow game of the season and it did not disappoint, as the Browns upset the Steelers, 24-19, thanks to a game-winning drive in the final minutes. Washington, D.C. — President Biden hosted the Celtics at the White House to celebrate their 18th championship. Fun fact: Biden's Secret Service code name is Celtic. ""For real. Because I'm Irish,"" he said. ""From this old Irish Celtic, to all you Celtics, congratulations."" Las Vegas — Sin City's circuit is ready for the second annual Las Vegas Grand Prix. Toronto — It would have been a crime for the Raptors to lose on a court this cool. They got the win. The NBA All-Star Game, long in need of a change amid declining ratings and non-competitive action, is finally switching things up. Coming soon: The NBA is reportedly tweaking the format for this year's All-Star Game in San Francisco, making it a four-team tournament that's expected to more closely resemble fast-paced pickup games. The 24 All-Stars will be split into three teams of eight, and the winner of the Rising Stars game (comprising top rookies, sophomores and G Leaguers) will be the fourth team. The semifinals will be to 40 points and the final will be to 25. Bottom line: Last year's All-Star Game, which was the highest-scoring ever (211-186) and featured an absurd 168 attempted threes, was universally panned. ESPN's Stephen A. Smith called it ""an absolute travesty,"" suggesting the NBA get rid of the game entirely. Hopefully all it needed was a refresh. 10 years ago today, Oklahoma true freshman Samaje Perine rushed for 427 yards against Kansas in a driving rainstorm, breaking the FBS record of 408 yards set a week earlier by Wisconsin's Melvin Gordon. Perine: 34 car, 427 yds (12.6 avg), 5 TD Gordon: 25 car, 408 yds (16.3 avg), 4 TD 400-yard club: The only other players to eclipse 400 yards in an FBS game? TCU's LaDainian Tomlinson in 1999 (406 yards) and Buffalo's Jaret Patterson in 2020 (409 yards). Look who it is! That's Sooners walk-on Baker Mayfield celebrating next to Perine. He wasn't eligible to play that season due to transfer rules but became the starter in 2015. A year after missing the playoffs, the Orlando Pride and Washington Spirit will meet for the NWSL Championship on Saturday night (8pm ET, CBS) in Kansas City. Historic venue: The match will be held at CPKC Stadium, home of the KC Current, which opened this spring as the first venue ever built specifically for a women's pro sports team.

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","NFL news, injury updates: Brock Purdy leaves 49ers practice, Jets fire GM Joe Douglas",https://sports.yahoo.com/live/nfl-news-injury-updates-brock-purdy-leaves-49ers-practice-jets-fire-gm-joe-douglas-130058701.html,"Mon, 18 Nov 2024 13:00:58 GMT",The Cowboys do not have a home win in the year 2024.,"The New York Jets are cleaning house, with GM Joe Douglas getting the boot exactly six weeks after the team fired head coach Robert Saleh. Since then, the Jets have won just one of their last six games since Jeff Ulbrich took over head coaching duties. Douglas' contract was set to expire after this season; he compiled a 30-64 record as general manager. Elsewhere in the NFL, while the Buffalo Bills and Los Angeles Chargers inched closer to solidifying their spots in the AFC playoff picture, the Jacksonville Jaguars moved closer to the top pick in the 2025 NFL Draft after a 52-6 beatdown at the hands of the Detroit Lions on Sunday. Doug Pederson led the Jaguars to middling 9-8 records in each of the past two seasons, even making the playoffs and winning a game in 2022, but an awful start to the year could mean his job is in jeopardy. Meanwhile, Nick Bosa left the 49ers' heartbreaking loss to the Seahawks, and it wasn't a re-aggravation of a hip injury that had him on the injury report heading into Week 11. But first, let's talk some Dallas Cowboys, who not only got pasted by the Houston Texans on Monday night, but haven't won at home in a shockingly long time. The Cowboys got demolished by the Houston Texas on Monday Night Football, losing 34-10 at home at AT&T Stadium. Dallas is now 3-7, with all three of their wins coming on the road. They and the struggling New York Giants are the only teams without a home win this season. But if you pull the camera back a bit, things look even worse for the Cowboys. The Giants' last home win was on Jan. 7, 2024, but the Cowboys haven't won a home game since Dec. 30, 2023. That means the Cowboys are the only team in all four major North American pro sports leagues without a home win in the year 2024. Even the Philadelphia 76ers and Washington Wizards, who are tied for the NBA's worst record at 2-11, each have a home win. With four of their seven remaining games at home, the Cowboys have a decent chance at securing a home stadium win before the season is over. But we've seen the 2024 Cowboys play. It's possible they go the entire 2024 season without a victory at home. Things aren't great when you lose a game by 46 points and you've got the worst record in the NFL. Doug Pederson's tenure on Florida's First Coast has turned sour after a first season that included an AFC South title and designs on shepherding Trevor Lawrence into becoming one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL. Well, at 2-9 and with the Jags having a Week 12 bye, now could be the time to make a change, according to Yahoo Sports' senior NFL writer Frank Schwab. ""On Saturday, someone leaked to NFL Media that with the Jaguars' bye week coming up, big changes could be made including firing Pederson. That's an underhanded way of finding out that keeping your job might depend on winning at Detroit, but at least Pederson knew the stakes. And like just about everything else since that Super Bowl win with the Eagles, Pederson fell short."" Pederson, who led the Eagles to a Super Bowl championship is just 42-50-1 as a head coach since with that lone 2022 playoff appearance. While the Jaguars didn't fire Pederson on Monday, stay tuned in Jacksonville. Just as Christian McCaffrey has returned to the lineup, the snake-bitten 2024 49ers are dealing with another injury to another major star. After Sunday's loss to the Seahawks, head coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed the oblique injury was a new one, but didn't offer more on what that would mean for the star pass rusher. Bosa has seven sacks this season, and has posted double-digit sack totals each of the past three years. The 5-5 49ers are tied with the Rams and Seahawks, a game back of the 6-4 Cardinals in the NFC West. An unexpected turn of events occurred at 49ers practice on Thursday. Quarterback Brock Purdy, who was listed on the team's injury report with a right shoulder issue, came out for practice. But after a few throws on a back field, Purdy had to stop and a trainer attended to his shoulder, as SI.com's Grant Cohn explained. Brock Purdy shuts himself down mid practice. pic.twitter.com/RITVVT967p — Grant Cohn (@grantcohn) November 21, 2024 Purdy then attempted to warm up with soft throws while San Francisco's other three quarterbacks went through drills with QB coach Brian Griese. After approximately five minutes, Purdy stopped and then went back to the locker room. The quarterback was hit on his shoulder during last week's game versus the Seahawks. He finished the game, though did not make any throws over 10 yards. There was no indication afterward that Purdy was hurt. If Purdy can't play on Sunday, Brandon Allen will likely start at quarterback for San Francisco. Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander hasn't officially been listed as out for Week 12's matchup with the 49ers, but he's not going to play as he recovers from a torn PCL. Alexander played only 10 snaps last week versus the Bears before having to come out of the game.

Defending his ""best friend,"" Lawrence, who the Giants selected 11 picks after Jones in the 2019 draft, said that while head coach Brian Daboll's decision to go to Tommy DeVito under center for this week's game against the Buccaneers was ""hard,"" he didn't agree with it. ""It's tough for that to happen. I can't control it,"" Lawrence said. ""They made the decision based off their evaluations and their thoughts and feelings. … That's my boy.

When asked after their 34-27 loss to the Chargers about the team's struggled finishing games, Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase passed on answering and said to ask coach Zac Taylor. ""Ask Zac,"" Chase said on Sunday. ""Ask the coaches. That's not my job. I play football on the field. I don't call plays for us."" On Tuesday, Taylor was asked about Chase's comments and said he didn't have a problem with his star receiver. ""He's emotional, and when you got a guy that works as hard as he does, leaves it all on the field, I do think things — I don't want to say 'misconstrued' — but can look differently than what they really are,"" Taylor said.

Kansas City is signing former Patriots wideout Tyquan Thornton to its practice squad. Thornton, 24, was waived by New England on Saturday. He was the team's second-round pick (No. 50 overall) in the 2022 NFL Draft after drawing attention at the scouting combine for running a 4.28 40-yard dash. This season, Thornton caught four passes for 47 yards. For his career, he's tallied 39 receptions for 385 yards and two touchdowns in three years with the Patriots. Nico Collins led the NFL in receiving when he suffered a hamstring injury in Week 5. On Monday, he'll return to the Houston Texans lineup against the Dallas Cowboys after missing five straight weeks. The Texans removed Collins from injured reserve ahead of last week's game against the Lions, but did not activate him for the game. They then removed his injury status on Saturday ahead of Monday's game. Per ESPN's Adam Schefter, Collins will play Monday night without any minutes or snap restrictions.

Now it could bring his family millions at auction.,"The past few weeks have been a whirlwind for Zachary Ruderman. He's the 10-year-old Dodgers fan who ended up with one of the most significant baseballs in team history — the one his favorite player, first baseman Freddie Freeman, hit for a walk-off grand slam during the 10th inning in Game 1 of the 2024 World Series against the New York Yankees. Since then, Zachary has seemingly become one of the most famous people living in Venice. “It’s a lot more attention than my son has ever had,"" his father, Nico Ruderman, said. ""He’s spoken to so many media outlets, so many interviews. People recognize him. I mean, literally everywhere we go people stop him and want to take pictures with him. He’s really actually been loving it. It’s been a fun experience for him.” Read more: Kid thought he was going to dentist. Dad took him to World Series and he caught Freddie Freeman's grand slam That experience is entering a new phase. On Wednesday, SCP Auctions announced the ball will be up for bid from Dec. 4-14. Coming just weeks after the Dodgers won their eighth World Series championship — with Freeman hitting four home runs and winning MVP honors, all on a badly sprained ankle — SCP founder and president David Kohler said his company thinks ""the sky's the limit"" for what the auction could bring. ""We think this is gonna bring seven figures,"" Kohler said. ""We think it’s one of the most historic baseballs ever, with the moment of this World Series, the first walk-off grand slam, the whole story of Freddie Freeman, the Dodgers, Game 1, extra innings. Just everything about it. I mean, it’s one of the most historic moments in sports and we feel that people are going to appreciate that."" Last month, Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani's 50th home run ball was sold by Goldin Auctions for a record $4.4 million. Could the Freeman ball be worth even more than that? “It could be. You never know,"" Kohler said. ""We’re gonna find out. Certainly the Ohtani ball was very, very significant and Ohtani is beloved, but this is more of the history of the game of baseball and just the moment — seeing that happen was just incredible.” Zachary, along with his father and mother Anne, were part of that moment. After Freeman blasted his game-winning shot into the right-field pavilion, the ball rolled next to Zachary's feet. The fifth-grader batted it over to his father, who pounced on it, stood up and handed it back to his son. “They’re just amazing memories,"" Zachary said Thursday, looking back on that night. ""Like after we got it, no one was mad. No one was trying to take it from us. Everyone was just super happy.” His father added: ""We just feel so lucky and honored to be a small part of such a huge moment in Dodger history."" The experience was so special that at first the family had no intention of parting with the ball.

""The problem is, if we keep it, we’re not gonna keep it in our house. I don’t want to pay for the insurance for it, so it would just be locked up in some safety deposit box. Nobody would ever see it. ""Maybe [the auction] brings life-changing money and pays for education for our son, and also allows somebody with the resources to actually display it and show it to the world. We’re really hoping that whoever buys it agrees to display it at Dodger Stadium for some time so everybody can see it. That’s really our wish.” Even with all the incredible experiences he's had because of the ball — including his favorite, speaking in front of Los Angeles City Council at City Hall and receiving a certificate of congratulations from Councilmember Traci Park earlier this month — Zachary said he's ""really excited"" about the auction. ""It’s probably going to be a pretty fun experience,” Zachary said. “We’ve had our fun with the ball,"" his father added. ""At this point he cares more about the memories, the pictures. He loves reading all the articles and watching all the news stories about it. That’s what’s fun for him, not the item itself.” Sign up for more Dodgers news with Dodgers Dugout.

The New England Patriots owner, who has made a concerted push in recent years to be enshrined in Canton, was passed over by the Hall's contributor committee in favor of NFL co-founder Ralph Hay, according to ESPN's Don Van Natta Jr. Kraft was previously a favorite to receive enshrinement, especially with the introduction of the contributor committee. Previously, Kraft had to compete with coaches for induction because a single subcommittee was in charge of picking non-player names for the ballot, but this year he only had to beat out other owners, executives and assorted figures in the game. So it's a bit of a surprise Kraft didn't make it, as one ESPN source bluntly put it: ""It's a huge surprise,"" said one source, who insisted on anonymity. ""And it's very disappointing. Unless you are an NFL historian, you don't know who Ralph Hay is."" Hay, who died in 1944, owned the Canton Bulldogs from 1918 to 1923. Those five years of ownership included the meeting hosted by Hay that led to the creation of the first incarnation of the NFL. Kraft's résumé is a bit different. The 83-year-old purchased a controlling stake in the Patriots in 1994 and has since presided over the most successful franchise of the 21st century. Many will credit Tom Brady and Bill Belichick more for those six Super Bowl titles, but Kraft has made it pretty clear he believes he deserves at least some credit. It was reported earlier this year Kraft's camp has been privately arguing for his enshrinement for a decade or so, lobbying voters overseeing both a book and docuseries about the Patriots dynasty that painted him in a very favorable light. The fact that Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is already in is apparently something of a sore spot. Of course, it's not like Kraft's tenure with the NFL is spotless, between the Patriots' cheating scandals and his own incident at a massage parlor in Florida. He can only hope the voters who matter see it a different way next year."

That’s the question. If he really cared about a World Series ring, Judge, who was named the unanimous 2024 AL MVP on Thursday, would sell his fancy new trophy on eBay and give the proceeds to Yankees general manager Brian Cashman so the club can sign another bullpen arm for 2025. That’s what a real captain would do. Derek Jeter, the perfect example of Yankees leadership, had the perspective and wherewithal to never play well enough to warrant winning such a selfish award. Look, I’m not saying that Judge should play worse during the regular season next year; that’s preposterous. But if he melted the AL MVP trophy down and had it remade into a sculpture of the 2024 Dodgers celebrating their world championship and then put that sculpture on his bedside table so he could wake up every morning properly motivated, it wouldn’t be the most inappropriate thing. It’s tradition for MVP winners to accept their awards at the annual BBWAA New York Chapter dinner in January. And while I’m sure fans would love to see Judge there, he should honestly be spending that time in the gym or the batting cage GRINDING for the 2025 season. A night in a tuxedo with boring writers like me isn’t working toward the ultimate goal of a Yankees parade. As they say, if you aren’t getting better, you’re getting worse. Shohei Ohtani, the unanimous 2024 NL MVP, is a different story, his own overlooked postseason struggles aside. Sure, the Dodger dynamo’s October OPS was only 15 points higher than Judge’s, but Ohtani is a winner who won. With Judge, that’s clearly not the case. And don’t forget: The last time Judge won this award, back in 2022, the Yankees were a train wreck the following season, missing out on the playoffs. Does the Yankees captain really want to tempt fate again? Might be best to let Bobby Witt Jr., who finished second in AL MVP voting, take the award. People speak volumes about Judge’s steadiness and consistency during the marathon of a 162-game season. That’s pretty cool, I guess, but I’d rather have a totally erratic teammate who wakes up hungover on Oct. 1 and clobbers 15 playoff bombs. Not somebody like Judge, who finished this past postseason with a ... .752 OPS, which ... actually isn’t that bad? Huh. How 'bout that? You know what? Maybe it’s best to hold multiple thoughts in our heads at the same time. Yes, Judge underwhelmed by his lofty standards in a 14-game postseason sample, but maybe, just maybe, that doesn’t invalidate what was an all-time magnificent offensive performance in the regular season. Judge’s 2024 was, by OPS+, the best season by a hitter since Barry Bonds put up a 263 OPS+ in 2004. The titanic Yankees outfielder finished the season with a comical stat line: 58 home runs, a .322 batting average, an 1.159 OPS and an adjusted OPS 123% better than league average. Only three players in MLB history have posted an OPS+ higher than Judge’s 223 mark this year: Bonds, Babe Ruth and Ted Williams. Not too shabby. And sure, as my idiotic ramblings above alluded to, Judge’s struggles on the big stage leave an unfortunate haze over our collective memory of his season. It’s a fact, one he knows and one he has owned: When the games mattered most, Judge was not at his best. Whether that’s because he can’t handle the spotlight or because baseball is difficult and random is up to the eye of the beholder. Just remember that the Yankees’ World Series Game 5 capitulation was so total and complete that it’s impossible to pin on any one soul. Maybe I’m being the “Steph Curry arguing against nobody” meme, but whatever. Judge's outstanding 162 cannot simply wipe away his autumnal stumble. Yet at the same time, his substandard October shouldn’t completely overshadow six months of downright dominance. Both are true, both are important, and both tell the story of Aaron Judge’s 2024, a season that we’ll remember for a long, long time. Hopefully, for all the right reasons."

Commissioner Rob Manfred told The Athletic's Evan Drellich on Wednesday that the league will test an automated ball-strike challenge system in spring training in 2025, with the hope that the system can be implemented in the regular season in 2026. The system will reportedly give teams two challenges per game, with teams retaining them when they are correct. Not every spring training ballpark will reportedly have the ABS cameras, but all teams will have the opportunity to play with the new system. From The Athletic: “I think we will have a spring training ABS test that will provide a meaningful opportunity for all major-league players to see what the challenge system will look like,” Manfred said. “From my perspective, there’s two sides to that test: It’s what clubs think about it, and also, what do the players think about it? And we’re gonna have to sort through both of those.” MLB has experimented with ABS systems in two formats in the minor leagues going back to 2019. Some games have seen the robo umps used to call every pitch, while others have used the challenge system about to hit spring training. The challenge system was used full-time in Triple-A, and you can see it applied to end a game here: Upon further review... @GoStripers win it!@Braves prospect Hayden Harris records all of his outs via strikeout to earn the save -- with the final one coming on an ABS challenge: pic.twitter.com/dlnBOvUoOs — Minor League Baseball (@MiLB) September 18, 2024 At one point last year, MLB said teams had a 47% success rate with challenges. Robo umps once felt like a radical change for MLB, but they've become something of an inevitability given how MLB has approached them. Because they've been around the minor leagues for years, an enormous chunk of current major leaguers have experience with the system. It has been a very slow transition for the league, but it appears to almost be over. There will almost certainly be complaints about the system (not every pitch that is technically a strike looks like a strike, and the same with balls), but many fans will take it over a human element that can be infuriating at times."

Like the majority in golf, Slumbers was disappointed by The Telegraph’s recent revelation that the US Ryder Cup team will break with nearly 100 years of tradition by paying its players directly from next year, but believes it is symptomatic of the obsession with dollars that has raged since the Saudis set up the LIV Golf series three years ago. Negotiations between the Kingdom’s Public Investment Fund and the PGA Tour to unify the game are dragging on and Slumbers thinks it is imperative they reach a hasty solution. “The divisive position that we have in the professional game has been very damaging for golf,” he told Telegraph Sport. “It’s been damaging in terms of our reputation as a sport. I was hoping that we’d have had peace by now, because we need to get some stability. We need to see the game become financially sustainable, because it cannot carry on like this. “If it is to have a long-term future, we need to stop talking as much about money – everything in golf seems to be dominated by money – and get back to being about values of the sport. If we do that, I think the general public will start to watch it again. “Look the public are watching certain events – some viewing figures are up. But, as we know, a lot of them are down and I think that has a lot to do with that whole concept of constantly talking about money. Unfortunately, the male professional game has become delinked from the fan. “If I look at the Ryder Cup purely as a golf fan, then week in, week out the pros are in a business, playing for money and for ranking points. But once every couple of years, they have the honour to play for their country or continent and, in a way, say thank you to the fans who’ve supported them. “And, historically, that’s why the Ryder Cup is such a great event, because it creates that amazing fan experience of supporting your country. That link could now be put in danger, in my opinion.” The sporting civil war has been Slumbers’ “biggest disappointment” in his 10 years in this position. “Up until the turn of the decade pro golf was going brilliantly and then we went into Covid and I think those who run professional golf did an unbelievably good job in getting golf back going,” he said. “And then in 2021, 2022 this divisiveness emerged [with the formation of LIV, which then spent billions on attracting big names], it just put a big brake on the game. “The pro game, that is. Because, after seeing membership and participation falling every year from 2006 to 2018, the recreational game is now booming and to me the biggest danger for the pro game is that delinking. “You know, when people used to ask me why participation levels were falling, I would reply that if people aren’t joining your club, perhaps you haven’t got a product that they want to buy. But on the back of that Covid bounce, those clubs changed, became more inclusive, attracted families and people did want to join. “So when they ask why are those people not watching the professional game week in, week out anymore, well maybe it’s because it’s not a product they want to watch. We need to be open and honest about that, but it is fixable because when the pro game is at its best, when the best players are playing against each other on some of the best courses in the world – and not just four times a year – it’s very compelling TV.” The R&A has yet to grant the LIV Golf series guaranteed berths in the Open Championship, but Slumbers did acknowledge that access from the breakaway circuit’s order of merit could be a “possibility” for next year when the entry categories are decided in January. However, it is not believed to be likely. Slumbers also had bad news for the 47th President of the United States. While calling Trump Turnberry “my favourite links course” he reiterated that the governing body’s position has not altered regardless of his re-election to the White House. “We will not be taking any of our championships to Turnberry until we’re comfortable that the discussion would be all about golf,” he said. “But it remains in the pool of courses, subject to that one caveat.” This includes the AIG Women’s Open. Slumbers is rightly proud of the event’s standing in the female sport since the R&A assumed control of the British major. It has been part of the drive to modernise the sport and take it away from the charges of sexism, which has perhaps been his most notable success at St Andrews HQ. Another important issue in his tenure has been to work with the US Golf Association to introduce regulations that will essentially rein back how far the ball can travel in a move to protect classic layouts such as the Old Course, as well as counter environmental concerns and fears that the pro male game is becoming too one-dimensional. The new regulations will come into effect for the pros in 2028, although there have been rumblings that the PGA Tour could refuse to implement the rules. Again, Slumbers has a warning as he prepares to hand over the reins to Mark Darbon, the former Northampton Saints chief executive, on December 13. “We can’t legislate for that, but what I will say is that if a tour did choose to do that, then they would not be playing by the rules of golf,” he said. “It would be as simple as that.” Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

How long before the ultra-competitive Giannis Antetokounmpo asked out? Houston is stacked with quality young players and tradable draft picks, they make an attractive trade partner. The problem: Neither side is interested. At least not right now. Milwaukee believes it can fix its problems. It has used a soft stretch of the schedule and epic play from Antetokounmpo to win 4-of-5 and start to right the ship, with Khris Middleton possibly returning soon. The Bucks wouldn’t trade Antetokounmpo unless he demanded it, anyway. As for Houston, it wants to see how its young core will come together and not break it apart, reports Kelly Iko at The Athletic. The Rockets are not interested in breaking up their core for Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, sources tell @TheAthletic. Houston, sitting at 10-5 and a game out of first in the West, remains focused on developing its young players as a collective. — Kelly Iko (@KellyIko) November 20, 2024 There will not be any serious Antetokounmpo trade talk until next offseason, at the earliest. Antetokounmpo's three-year contract extension, which he signed a year ago, doesn't kick in until next season. How good can a core of Alperen Sengun, Jalen Green, Jabari Smith Jr., Tari Eason and Amen Thompson be in Houston? Right now they are 11-5 and third in the West, the Rockets wisely are going to be patient and see how far Ime Udoka can lead this group. If Antetokounmpo does eventually ask out, it's easy to see the Rockets being one of the teams in the mix to land him (along with Brooklyn, and maybe Golden State, although any deal with the Warriors is challenging because of the tax aprons). For now, just enjoy watching the young Rockets play basketball, they have become one of my favorite League Pass teams of the season."

Botic van de Zandschulp, who beat Rafael Nadal in the final match of the Spaniard's career on Tuesday, put the Dutch team 1-0 up on Friday when he defeated Daniel Altmaier in the first singles match. The world number 80 needed 10 match points to wrap up a tense 6-4 6-7 (12-14) 6-3 win. Griekspoor stopped the best-of-three tie from going to a deciding doubles as he surged back from a set down to overcome Jan-Lennard Struff 6-7 (4-7) 7-5 6-4. ""We believed in ourselves so much, we always felt this was possible so to do it now feels unbelievable,"" said Griekspoor. The Netherlands will face defending champions Italy - led by world number one Jannik Sinner - or Australia in Sunday's final. ""It's more unique that we do it because we don't have that top-five player, we don't have that top-10 player, we don't have that top-15 player - but it's a team effort,"" Netherlands captain Paul Haarhuis said. ""We have to believe in ourselves, whoever is against us, that we can do it. It's our time this year. We're here and we're going to make it count."" Three-time winners Germany were aiming to reach the final for the first time since they last won the title in 1993. They were without world number two Alexander Zverev, who said last month that he would miss the Davis Cup Finals in order to ""recover and be back at 100%"" for the 2025 season. There was a a febrile atmosphere when Van de Zandschulp faced 22-time Grand Slam winner Nadal, with some of his first-serve misses cheered by the partisan crowd. No longer the villain, there was still tension for the Dutchman as Altmaier fought back from a break down in the second set and saved five match points in a 26-point tie-break to force a deciding set. But Van de Zandschulp struck the decisive blow to break at 4-3 in the third and held his nerve to brush off a series of double faults and serve out the win at the 10th time of asking. ""I had the toughest match of my life on Tuesday so everything that comes next maybe is a little bit easier,"" Van de Zandschulp said. In a closely-fought second singles match, neither player faced a break point in the opening set and it was Struff who upped the intensity to win the resulting tie-break. However, Griekspoor battled back and his serve proved crucial as he sealed victory with his 25th ace. It meant Van de Zandschulp and Wesley Koolhof, who is set to retire after the Davis Cup, were not called to action for the deciding doubles. ""It has been an incredible journey over the last 15 or 20 years of playing tennis. I did it with a lot of passion,"" Koolhof said as his career was celebrated with a retirement ceremony after the Netherlands' win. ""We're not done, I'm not done.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday after the Warriors’ 120-97 win over the Atlanta Hawks, Green offered his thoughts on the second-year pro’s struggles. “What he’s trying to work through is y’all’s fault,” Green said, referencing the media. “…It's hard, and I don't say this from experience myself, I say this from experience watching people, it's hard having a great rookie season and coming back having a good second year or better. It's tough. “That's why you've always heard about the sophomore slump. It's a very tough thing to do, and I think for him, he's just put so much pressure on himself or the player he wants to be or that he thinks he should be, and that's unnecessary, because what he's special at is doing all of the other things on the floor and when you put the pressure on yourself like 'I gotta make this shot,' but there are some guys that have that pressure and have to because that's what they do. If you don't have to have that pressure, and I say that from experience, don't put that pressure on yourself.” Draymond Green went long on Brandin Podziemski’s shooting struggles and the pressure he’s putting on himself“What he’s trying to work through is y’all’s fault.”“I’m saying this because I hope he hears it.”Full soundbite pic.twitter.com/03dGCG0fTF — Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) November 21, 2024 While Podziemski excelled in his first season, earning NBA All-Rookie honors, the 21-year-old has struggled mightily on offense 13 games into the season. Podziemski is averaging 7.8 points per game while shooting 38 percent from the field and an underwhelming 19.1 percent from 3-point range. Green has been quick to offer his mentorship, explaining how the rest of the Warriors know that Podziemski will turn things around eventually. ""Me and Steph [Curry] talk to him every day, like 'Who cares, miss seven [shots], no one cares but you,” Green told reporters. “Like you're the only person thinking about the shots you miss.' No one else is thinking about it, but he kind of puts this pressure on himself of what he needs to be and every shot means so much. “It's a soft Wednesday in November, that shot don't mean that much. But he carries that weight, and I think anyone who carries that amount of weight in anything, it affects you negatively. And I hate that for him, and so that's something that we've been trying to talk to him about. Like, stop reacting to everything that goes wrong for you. No one cares but you. Nobody else. ""You almost want to tell him, 'Shut up, man!' Because again, none of us are thinking that way ... when the pace that you bring to the floor, the crackbacks that you get, the steals that you're getting on the weak side of the rotation, the charges that you take, those are all great things. So if the one thing you're struggling with is your shot, but you're doing five or six other things great, I think that will outweigh your shot. And he should appreciate that, lean into that. If he leans into that, the shots will fall."" While the Warriors (11-3) are off to a strong start, the team will need Podziemski to figure out his shot as injuries pile up and the grind of the NBA season takes its toll. For Golden State to remain in the hunt for the Western Conference's No. 1 seed, its bench will need to start shouldering more of the offensive load. Expecting Curry to score at will in every game is not realistic. Given the depth of the reserves, which is on pace to score the most bench points in NBA history, it does not fall entirely on the 21-year-old to score. With such strong mentors backing him, Podziemski should regain his shot at some point this season and break out of this slump. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"

On the streets outside her house, neighborhood kids emulated their hero. Dyer pieced together a set of goalie pads from garbage she found in dumpsters, her sewing kit and shoe glue. Soon, Massachusetts began building more arenas and it was on one of these rinks that Dyer first stepped on the ice. “I started as a figure skater because at the time that was the only way girls could get on the ice,” Dyer recalls. “But my brother David, who’s two years older, was a hockey player so I would get off the figure skating rink and run over to the hockey rink to watch. I always wanted to play hockey and begged for two years until my father found Assabet in Concord, the next town over. My first day of skating with Assabet was in my brother’s equipment with figure skates.” It didn’t take long for Dyer to skyrocket up the ranks at Assabet, aided by a high school program that included future NHLers Bob Sweeney and Jeff Norton. Her goaltending partner at the school was future Hockey Hall of Famer Tom Barrasso. She went on to play four years of NCAA hockey at Northeastern, graduating just in time to try out for the national team ahead of the inaugural 1990 world championships. As tryouts took place at Northeastern, Dyer didn’t even need to move the equipment from her stall. She just changed the color of her jersey when she was named to Team USA. Related: Fiery buses, beer showers and the smell of manure: life in ice hockey’s minor leagues Suiting up for Team USA in the gold-medal game changed her life forever. “It was one of the greatest events of my life, probably second only to the birth of my child,” Dyer says. “It was amazing to see and feel the energy in the arena for a women’s hockey game.” Coming home from the first world championships in Ottawa, Dyer saw a huge gap in the women’s game, one that often left women’s bodies unprotected. Even the top players in the world were forced to use equipment designed for men. There was no other alternative. Dyer also recognized that women were an afterthought in the hockey equipment industry. Now she saw an opportunity. “I would see players – Cammi Granato is a perfect example – I think she played at 5ft 7in and let’s say 130 lbs. So she’d have to wear a men’s medium pant for the pad to come down to her shin guards. But then she’d have to take the waist and cinch it in tight because she was slender. So now her kidney pads are in front of her belly,” she explains. “Bending forward to tie their skates, players had to re-open their pants to let the hard plastic kidney pads flare out and then do them back up. So players were carrying this extra bulk where they needed dynamic movement and had no protection on their kidneys. I thought, this is ridiculous. Dyer had one mission in mind: to find a company willing to manufacture sticks and protective equipment specifically built for women. “Coming from USA Hockey, we just had hockey pants that the men wore. They were heavy and weren’t good for performance or for protection. So that became my motto, performance and protection. Protection because our equipment kept the padding in place where players needed it, and performance because it fit and it didn’t shift all over. “I had a good amount of attention coming back from the 1990 world championships. I just came home and I was so pumped and so full of energy and visions in a thousand directions of where women’s sports could go,” she explains. “I just picked up the phone and called every single person I could think of and I called every single hockey manufacturer. I had a long conversation with Bauer and they were seemingly supportive but then they just couldn’t commit the time or the manufacturing to it.” One company, however, said yes. And it changed the game forever. “I ended up with Louisville Hockey because they were Canadian so there was less time delay in trying new equipment as we were tweaking it,” she explains. “They were small enough to be flexible, and they were committed to me, so I switched to wearing their product in 1992. I really became part of the family as soon as I started work.” She would spend the next 17 years working with the company. In the back of Team USA’s bus, Kelly Dyer sketched out ideas, using her teammates as models: Lisa Brown-Miller for size small, Cammi Granato for size medium, and Kelly O’Leary for large. “Everybody was constantly pulling their pants up and you couldn’t keep them up,” Dyer explains. “The same with shoulder pads. We had kids wearing these massive shoulder pads, so I really saw a need. With gloves, women don’t have the depth in the fingers, so you have all this material taking away from maximizing your strength. Just thinning out the gussets on the fingers and then narrowing them meant that when you went to make a grip you were using the full strength of your hand. Instead of having your hand spread out, you were actually maximizing the transference of your energy through the stick. Before, a lot of girls would cut their palms out, but then they’d have all this extra material dangling off the back of their hands.” It was a significant shift for women who had been filing the picks off figure skates and wearing their brothers’ equipment for decades. “The sticks – first we did wood, but then we went with composites. Louisville bought Fontaine so we had the wood blades with the melt-in composite shaft. We made women’s sticks with a smaller radius, we made gloves, we made shoulder pads with breast protection, and we made pants that were shorter on the torso and longer in the legs.” “Makers of sports equipment have finally realized there’s another sex,” wrote the Chicago Tribune in 1996, as Louisville prepared to announce announced their groundbreaking line of women’s hockey. “The industry is quickly learning that there are millions of women out there who want to play sports, and they have purchasing power,” said Mike May of the Sporting Goods Manufacturing Association. “They need stuff to fit their bodies.” The plan was to fill a growing void in the market and tour the equipment prior to the debut of women’s hockey at the 1998 Olympics – and to be prepared for an explosion afterward. In another first for women’s hockey, Dyer began signing athletes to endorsement deals to join her as ambassadors for the Wallaceburg company. “I didn’t want to make it all about me, so then we signed Erin Whitten, and we did a Whitten goalie stick. Then I thought, well, we need a Canadian, so I signed Geraldine Heaney.” “From the moment I first tried on the new equipment I could tell that it was different from anything I had ever used before. It’s designed for female proportions. It holds the pads in the right places, providing protection that unisex equipment cannot offer,” Cammi Granato said in a Louisville advertisement. Granato also appeared on an iconic Louisville poster alongside Mark Messier, each wearing the other’s jersey and looking back at the camera, decked out from head to toe in Louisville hockey equipment. Granato and Heaney, both future members of the Hall of Fame, became the faces of the women’s equipment industry, promoting “proportionally designed hockey equipment for female athletes.” Emblazoned on their photos in large yellow letters was the campaign’s slogan: “Don’t tell me what I can’t do.” The following is an excerpt from the new book, Ice In Their Veins: Women’s Relentless Pursuit of the Puck, by Ian Kennedy."

However, Trump has not provided specifics on what steps he would take. “You just ban it,” he said during a Fox News town hall in October. “The president bans it. You just don’t let it happen.” There has been an increase in bills from Republicans that would limit the participation of transgender athletes in sports across the United States, but so far, they have largely targeted youth sports. The NWSL issued a policy on transgender and nonbinary athlete participation in 2021, which begins with the guiding principle of “creating a safe, non-discriminatory and inclusive environment for all of its athletes while maintaining competitive equity throughout the league.” The policy does allow challenges to an athlete’s eligibility under the policy, though the league states it “will only consider requests that are reasonable and made in good faith.” According to the league’s eligibility guidelines, any athlete assigned female at birth is eligible to play in the league, while those who are designated female at birth who are transitioning to male and are undergoing testosterone hormone therapy are ineligible to compete in the NWSL, unless their hormone levels fall under certain levels. Athletes who transition from male to female are eligible to compete if their total testosterone level is within the typical limits of women athletes over a set period. The NWSL currently only has one out transgender player, who was assigned female at birth and who identifies as nonbinary. Berman did not offer specifics when asked about whether the league has plans to handle possible issues around immigration policy changes and how, or if, international players could be affected. Over the last two World Cup cycles, women’s soccer has been subject to Trump’s attention. While he has largely focused on the now-retired U.S. women’s national team and Reign player Megan Rapinoe in 2019 and 2023, he has also been highly critical of the U.S. women’s team. Following the USWNT’s exit from the 2023 World Cup in a penalty shoot-out with Sweden, Trump posted on Truth Social that the loss was “fully emblematic of what is happening to our once great Nation under Crooked Joe Biden.” “Many of our players were openly hostile to America — No other country behaved in such a manner, or even close,” he added. On Friday, Berman did not provide much in the way of specifics of any potential additional protections the league would put in place for players or staff, especially in the context of a player having been criticized previously. “We’re committed to ensuring that our players and our staff get all of their needs met, whether that’s healthcare, other protections around mental health — any support that anyone needs in our ecosystem,” Berman said.

On Tuesday, the Los Angeles Sparks announced they hired longtime Utah head coach Lynne Roberts, who jumps from college basketball to the professional ranks for the first time in her career. Her hiring came a week after the Atlanta Dream hired Karl Smesko, Florida Gulf Coast’s coach of more than 20 seasons. Two leading offensive minds — in the college game — are now WNBA head coaches. While rare for WNBA franchises to turn to college coaches to fill vacancies, multiple league sources told that they’re being targeted more than in past years. Part of the change is financial. Salaries for WNBA head coaches in 2024 ranged from around $350,000 to just over $1 million annually, multiple league sources said, a nearly double increase from even five years ago. According to USA Today’s salary database, Roberts earned around $700,000 at Utah last season, while Smesko earned around $450,000. It’s safe to assume their franchises provided them with comparable pay or pay bumps. Hiring college coaches from either mid-major programs or less-established Power 5 programs has always been more realistic (and cheaper) than hiring from the upper echelon of college basketball. With more comparable salaries (and a willingness from WNBA teams to pay buyouts), pro opportunities have become more appealing, especially amid changing dynamics like conference realignments, NIL and high transfer rates in college athletics. Conflicting schedules — Roberts and Smesko left their programs with their seasons already underway — no longer seem to be as much of a deterrent either.  Scenes from our introductory press conference for our NEW head coach. pic.twitter.com/CU2dce9pcW  — Los Angeles Sparks (@LASparks) November 22, 2024 Yet, a WNBA franchise had not hired a coach without NBA, G League or prior WNBA (player, assistant or head coach) experience since the Chicago Sky hired Pokey Chatman in 2011 from Spartak Moscow after her tenure at LSU. Roberts and Smesko’s hirings could send signals to the rest of women’s basketball that the college-to-pro coaching route might be a viable pipeline, depending on how well they perform in the WNBA. Their arrivals also underscore changes in how the WNBA game is played, as increased awareness of offensive efficiency, by way of 3s and layups, is central to success. Roberts and Smesko are known for their offensive philosophies. Smesko put an overwhelming emphasis on 3-point shots (since 2009-10 — the first year data is available via Her Hoop Stats — FGCU has finished in the top four of Division I in 3-point attempt rate every season). Over the last three seasons under Roberts, Utah ranked No. 1 in 3-point field goal attempts, second in offensive ratings at the rim and third in effective field goal percentage. After attempting a league-low 14.9 3s per game last year, the Chicago Sky made a similar philosophical decision in hiring Tyler Marsh. Natalie Nakase should bring modern offensive principles to the Golden State Valkyries as well, just as Nate Tibbetts did last season, when he went from the NBA to the Phoenix Mercury. (The New York Liberty led the league last season with 29 3-point attempts per game. The Mercury and Liberty set a WNBA record with 33 combined 3-pointers in a game last season.) The WNBA is continuing to shift, in more ways than one. Three head coach openings remain: the Washington Mystics, Dallas Wings and Connecticut Sun. The Wings’ recently hired general manager Curt Miller called their ongoing search “global.” (More on Dallas’ developments later.) The Sun are replacing Stephanie White, who took the Indiana Fever job shortly after Connecticut announced their split. White recently confirmed that her top two assistants, Briann January and Austin Kelly, interviewed for head coach jobs this cycle. It wouldn’t be shocking to see either end up as the Sun’s next head coach. If neither is elevated, one or both could follow White to Indiana. After a decorated playing career, which includes nine seasons with the Fever, January will enter her third season as a WNBA coach. She is well-regarded around the league and is currently coaching as an assistant with the Detroit Pistons’ G League affiliate, the Motor City Cruise. Kelly had years of college experience before joining the Sun, including working as the director of recruiting under White at Vanderbilt. His wife, Karima Christmas-Kelly, was a Fever assistant for the past two seasons. White said she hopes to keep them working together by bringing them to Indiana. “I would love to keep Karima on board,” White said. After parting ways with general manager Mike Thibault and coach Eric Thibault about a month ago, the Mystics are still moving through their search. They want to hire a coach and GM by Jan. 1, a person with knowledge of the process confirmed to . Like Los Angeles and Atlanta, the Mystics’ management group has hired a search firm to identify prospective candidates. The Washington Post was first to report their possible timeline and search firm. Coincidentally or not, so far this cycle both hires involving coaches resulted in college hires. Firing Weatherspoon just 11 months after the Chicago Sky hired her surprised many — including Weatherspoon. Co-owner Nadia Rawlinson had lauded her upon hire as “the perfect choice to build on our championship culture and usher in an exciting new era.” “It wasn’t a decision I saw coming,” Weatherspoon said Wednesday, speaking publicly about the firing for the first time. Weatherspoon, who was replaced by Marsh on Nov. 2, has already moved on. She’s one of six head coaches hired for the inaugural season of Unrivaled, the upstart 3×3 winter basketball league which begins Jan. 17. But she didn’t rule out a possible return to the WNBA next season. “That is to be seen,” Weatherspoon said. “One thing about me is I don’t run from anything. I don’t have to hide from anything. I don’t have to answer anything. Because I know how hard I worked. And I know that the opportunity for me will come and I’ll be ready.” A possible fit could be in Las Vegas, as the Aces still have an assistant coach opening following the departures of both Nakase and Marsh. (They announced Ty Ellis as one of their new assistants.) Weatherspoon was a longtime teammate of Aces head coach Becky Hammon and the two remain close friends. The decision to join Unrivaled isn’t expected to hinder Weatherspoon, or any of the league’s other coaches, from other potential WNBA coaching jobs. Unrivaled ends March 17, more than a month before WNBA training camps are expected to begin. Two of the league’s other coaches — Andrew Wade and Nola Henry — were also on WNBA staffs last season and could be back in the W this summer. Entering this college season, Smesko boasted the third-highest winning percentage among active college coaches behind UConn’s Geno Auriemma and LSU’s Kim Mulkey. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that teams have tried to hire Smesko away from FGCU before. Over the years, Smesko interviewed with Indiana, Illinois and Oregon State, among others. In 2017, he turned down an offer from USC, according to Sports Illustrated. Smesko said that several years ago he interviewed for a WNBA head coaching opportunity only to have it fall through “at the last minute.” (He declined to identify the team.) “When another opportunity arose, I wanted to hear about it,” Smesko said about the Dream. “Just everything has really meshed well with what they’re looking for and what I think my strengths as a coach are.” Don’t expect an immediate turnaround in Dallas. Although Miller said Sunday that in recent years, No. 1 picks have changed the trajectory of teams, the impact has seldom fully manifested in top picks’ rookie seasons. In the last decade, only one No. 1 pick (Jackie Young) has been on a team that finished that first season over .500. The Sparks fired Miller as their head coach after two years this offseason, but he nearly came to the Wings two years earlier. He was a finalist for the Wings’ head coach opening in 2023 before eventually taking the Sparks job, league sources said. That prior relationship was important in Miller taking the GM job years later. Miller said he’s seeing “a tremendous amount of interest” in the head coach position, which he expects to pick up more following the lottery results. The broad assumption is the Wings would take UConn’s Paige Bueckers, who could transform the franchise. Assuming they keep the selection, the Wings will be the fourth franchise in five years to have a new head coach pair with a No. 1 pick (the lone exception was Christie Sides last season with the Fever). In the cases of Sides in 2023, Tanisha Wright in 2022 and Vickie Johnson in 2021, each was hired before the WNBA Draft Lottery. The Liberty hired coach Walt Hopkins after the 2020 lottery, having secured the top pick. Smith, the former Liberty head coach and longtime Minnesota Lynx assistant, took an assistant role at Ohio State as the next step in her career. The news came despite Smith, a Hall of Fame player and a W coach for a decade, widely being considered a popular candidate to land one of this offseason’s many openings. Smith most recently was the associate head coach of the Lynx. She was the head coach of the Liberty for two seasons, but her tenure came during a period of drastic transition within the franchise as it relocated from Madison Square Garden to Westchester County Center and experienced a significant drop in resources.

I got married a year ago, have a seventh-grader, have a freshman here at Ohio State, my parents are getting older,” she said. “Home is here in Columbus.” She is a member of the Ohio State Athletics Hall of Fame, has a house in the city and has remained around the program, though this assistant position is her first official role with the Buckeyes since she graduated in 1996.

CBSSports.com Headlines,2024 RSM Classic scores: Joel Dahmen inches closer to goal as Patrick Fishburn leads after Round 2,https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/2024-rsm-classic-scores-joel-dahmen-inches-closer-to-goal-as-patrick-fishburn-leads-after-round-2/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 23:32:16 +0000",Dahmen needs to finish within the top 125 in the FedEx Cup standings to maintain his full PGA Tour status,"ST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. (AP) -- PGA Tour rookie Patrick Fishburn played bogey-free for an 8-under 64 for his first lead after any round. Joel Dahmen was 10 shots behind and had a bigger cause for celebration Friday in the RSM Classic. Dahmen made a 5-foot par putt on his final hole for a 2-under 68 in tough conditions brought on by the wind and cold, allowing him to make the cut on the number and get two more days to secure his PGA Tour card for next year. He is No. 124 in the FedEx Cup. ""I still got more to write this weekend for sure,"" said Dahmen, who recently had said his story is not yet over. ""But without having the opportunity to play this weekend, my story would be a lot shorter this year."" Fishburn took advantage of being on the easier Plantation course, with trees blocking the brunt of the wind and two additional par 5s. He also was helped by Maverick McNealy, who opened with a 62 on the tougher Seaside course, making two bogeys late in his round and having to settle for a 70. Fishburn, who already has locked up his card for next year, was at 11-under 131 and led McNealy and Lee Hodges (63) going into the weekend. Michael Thorbjornsen had a 69 and was the only player who had to face Seaside on Friday who was among the top five. What mattered on this day, however, was far down the leaderboard. The RSM Classic is the final tournament of the PGA Tour season, and only the top 125 in the FedEx Cup have full status in 2025. That's more critical than ever with the tour only taking the top 100 for full cards after next season. Players like Dahmen will need full status to get as many playing opportunities as they can. That explains why he felt so much pressure on a Friday. He didn't make a bogey after his opening hole and was battling temperatures in the low 50s that felt even colder with the wind ripping off the Atlantic waters of St. Simons Sound. He made a key birdie on the 14th, hitting a 4-iron for his second shot on the 424-yard hole. Dahmen also hit wedge to 2 feet on the 16th that put him on the cut line, and from the 18th fairway, he was safely on the green some 40 feet away. But he lagged woefully short, leaving himself a testy 5-footer with his job on the line. ""It was a great putt. I was very nervous,"" Dahmen said. ""But there's still work to do. It wasn't the game-winner, it was like the half-court shot to get us to halftime. But without that, and the way I played today, I wouldn't have anything this weekend."" His playing partners weren't so fortunate. The tour put three in danger of losing their cards in the same group -- Zac Blair (No. 123), Dahmen and Wesley Bryan (No. 125). The cut was at 1-under 141. Blair and Bryan came to the 18th hole needing birdie to be assured of making the cut and both narrowly missed. Now they have to wait to see if anyone passes them, which is typically the case. Thorbjornsen in a tie for fourth and Daniel Berger (66 at Plantation) in a tie for 17th both were projected to move into the top 125. Dahmen, indeed, still has work to do. Fishburn gets a weekend to see if he can end his rookie year with a win. ""I've had a lot of experience playing in cold growing up in Utah, playing this time of year, kind of get used to playing when the body's not moving very well and you've got to move your hands,"" said Fishburn, who played college golf at BYU. ""Just pretty happy with how I played."" Ludvig Aberg, the defending champion and No. 5 player in the world competing for the first time in more than two months because of knee surgery, bounced back with a 64 on Plantation and was back in the mix. Aberg played with Luke Clanton, the Florida State sophomore who looks like he belongs each week. Clanton, the No. 1 player in the world amateur ranking who received a sponsor exemption, had a 65 at Plantation and was two shots off the lead. Clanton already has a runner-up and two other top 10s since June. ""Playing with him, it's pretty awesome to watch,"" Clanton said. ""We were kind of fanboying a little it. I know he's a really good dude but to be playing with him and to see what he's done over the last couple years, it's pretty inspirational."" Copyright 2024 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

They will host the Sacramento Kings  at 10:30  p.m.  ET at Intuit Dome. The Clippers might want some stickum for this one  as the team gave up 22 turnovers  on Wednesday.  The Kings are hoping to do what the Magic couldn't  on Wednesday: put an end to the Clippers' winning streak, which now stands at three games. The Clippers came out on top against the Magic by a score of  104-93.  The Clippers  smashed the offensive glass and  finished the game with 15  offensive rebounds. They easily outclassed their opponents in that department as the Magic only pulled down two.  Meanwhile,  the point spread  may have favored the Kings  last Monday, but the final result did not. They were just a bucket shy of victory  and fell  109-108 to the Hawks.  The losing side was boosted by   Keon Ellis, who  went 9 for 15 from beyond the arc en route to 33 points plus six  rebounds. Those nine  threes gave  him a new career-high.  Los Angeles' win was  their sixth straight at home, which  pushed their record up to 9-7. As for Sacramento, their loss dropped their record down to 8-7. Keep an eye on the arc in  Friday's  contest:  The Clippers have been dynamite from deep this season,  having  made 38.2% of their  threes per game. It's a different story for the Kings, though, as  they've  only  made 34% of their  threes this season. Given the Clippers' sizable advantage in that area, the Kings will need to find a way to close that gap.  The Clippers beat the Kings 107-98  in their previous meeting  two weeks ago. Will the Clippers repeat their success,  or do  the Kings have a better game plan this time around? We'll find out soon enough.  Sacramento is a 3-point favorite against Los Angeles, according to the latest NBA odds. The line on this game has moved quite a bit since it opened, as it started out with the Clippers as a 5.5-point favorite. The over/under is 220.5  points.

There could be some fireworks in this showdown: San Diego State and Utah State allow a combined 67.4 points per game.   Date: Saturday, Nov. 23 | Time: 7 p.m. ET Location: War Memorial Stadium -- Laramie, WyomingTV: CBS Sports Network [Channel finder] Live stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports App (Free)Spread: Boise State -22.5 | Will the Broncos cover? Check out SportsLine's Week 13 projections here Boise State has been fairly dominant this year, and it is a heavy favorite as it travels to face Wyoming. The Broncos have gotten some tough tests recently as they continue on their journey towards the Mountain West Championship Game -- and, perhaps, even beyond. After winning three of its first four MWC games by at least 21 points, Boise State got taken to the brink against a now 3-8 Nevada squad in Week 11, escaping with a narrow 28-21 win. Then, last Saturday, the Broncos trailed San Jose State 21-14 entering the third quarter before scoring 28 unanswered points to pull away late. So Boise State can't take anything for granted, even if Wyoming is 2-8 on the year with just one win since the start of October.  Date: Saturday, Nov. 23 | Time: 10:30 p.m. ET Location: Valley Children's Stadium -- Fresno, CaliforniaTV: CBS Sports Network [Channel finder] Live stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports App (Free)Spread: Fresno State -3 | Will the Bulldogs cover? Check out SportsLine's Week 13 projections here This is Colorado State's biggest remaining test on the path to the MWC Championship Game. Ranked programs like Boise State and even UNLV have stolen the spotlight, but the Rams are quietly 5-0 in conference play and haven't lost in over a month after a lackluster 2-3 start to the year. Granted, they've only faced off against one team with a winning record amid their five-game winning streak -- and that will not change as they take on Fresno State -- but there's something to be said about taking care of business amid a chaotic year. As for Fresno State, the Bulldogs, at 5-5, are one win away from bowl eligibility. Though they have been for almost a month now after beating San Jose State on Oct. 26 before suffering (bad) back-to-back losses against Hawaii and Air Force."

Juventus are currently sitting sixth, but only two points behind Napoli, the current Serie A leaders. AC Milan are slightly behind, but still seventh with 18 points with one game in hand. The game against Juventus becomes a great chance for Christian Pulisic and his teammates to make their place in table look better. Here's what you need to know:  AC Milan: The home side have an almost full squad available and Fonseca can count on both USMNT stars Yunus Musah and Christian Pulisic in the potential starting lineup. Spanish striker Alvaro Morata is back at the best of his form after suffering a minor injury before the International break and will play alongside the two Americans and Rafael Leao in the attack.   Potential AC Milan XI: Maignan; Emerson Royal, Thiaw, Tomori, Theo Hernandez; Reijnders, Fofana; Musah, Pulisic, Leao; Morata. Juventus: On the other hand, Juventus have to deal with multiple injuries including the latest ACL injury of Juan Cabal who will miss the rest of the season, and striker Dusan Vlahovic who will be replaced for the AC Milan game by USMNT striker Timothy Weah, who will play as a central striker.  Potential Juventus XI: Di Gregorio; Savona, Gatti, Kalulu, Cambiaso; Locatelli, Thuram; Conceicao, Koopmeiners, Yildiz; Weah. The home side showed to be very strong against the big teams this season while they struggled more against smaller teams. For this, and also for the injuries that are affecting Motta's team, they are the favourites. Pick: AC Milan 2, Juventus 1."

According to the Associated Press, which obtained a copy of the memo, the league urged players to take additional precautions when away from home. Those precautions ranged from updating alarm systems and keeping valuables in safes to using ""protective guard services"" during road trips and even having dogs around for security purposes. In September, while Minnesota Timberwolves guard Mike Conley was attending a Minnesota Vikings game, burglars broke into his house and stole jewelry, Medina Police Chief Jason Nelson told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. In November, Milwaukee Bucks center Bobby Portis said ""most of my prized possessions"" had been stolen from his house while he was at a game and offered a $40,000 reward for any information that led to the return of the stolen items. According to the memo, the FBI has connected recent burglaries to ""transnational South American Theft Groups."" These ""reportedly well-organized, sophisticated"" crime rings ""incorporate advanced techniques and technologies, including pre-surveillance, drones, and signal jamming devices."" The FBI believes that the rings are ""primarily focused on cash and items that can be resold on the black market, such as jewelry, watches, and luxury bags."" The NFL sent its players a similar security alert this week. The homes of Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs were both broken into in October, just days apart.

CBSSports.com Headlines,49ers' historic run as favored team in jeopardy vs. Packers with QB Brock Purdy out with injury,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/49ers-historic-run-as-favored-team-in-jeopardy-vs-packers-with-qb-brock-purdy-out-with-injury/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 23:44:53 +0000",San Francisco's incredible run appears to be coming to an end,"The San Francisco 49ers haven't been an underdog for a game since 2022, but that incredible run appears to be coming to an end against the Green Bay Packers in light of Brock Purdy's shoulder injury that will keep him out of Sunday's game.  San Francisco went from a 3-point underdog to 5.5-point underdog against Green Bay after 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan ruled Purdy out of the game on Friday. Purdy will be replaced by 32-year-old Brandon Allen, who has a 2-7 regular-season record and hasn't played in a regular-season game since 2022.  The 49ers have been the favored team in 36 straight games. That's the third-longest stretch during the Super Bowl era, behind the 1999-02 Rams (50) and the 2016-20 Patriots (64). Those Rams teams played in two Super Bowls, winning one. The Patriots won two Super Bowls over that span and joined the 1971-73 Dolphins and 1990-93 Bills as the only teams to play in three straight Super Bowls.  Purdy isn't the only notable 49ers player who will not play on Sunday. Former Defensive Player of the Year Nick Bosa also won't play, while perennial All-Pro tackle Trent Williams is questionable.  Despite his team's battered state, Shanahan is keeping the faith as far as Sunday's game is concerned. While they won't have Purdy and Bosa, the 49ers still have some of the league's top players, specifically wideout Deebo Samuel, running back Christian McCaffrey, linebacker Fred Warner and tight end George Kittle.  ""We've had a real good week of practice,"" Shanahan said on Friday. ""I know it's disappointing. We knew there was a chance for Nick, I think the guys were a little surprised with Brock yesterday, but we addressed all of that today.  ""We're gonna have 48 guys in uniform. Our guys believe in themselves. I believe in them. We're missing two good players, definitely, but we've got a lot of good players out there. By no means, we don't have a chance to win. We're gonna go fight out tails off, and this should be a real good game."""
CBSSports.com Headlines,"MLB non-tender candidates: Former Cy Young candidate, several All-Stars among 10 most interesting decisions",https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-non-tender-candidates-former-cy-young-candidate-several-all-stars-among-10-most-interesting-decisions/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 23:03:43 +0000",The 2024 non-tender deadline falls on Friday,"Major League Baseball's offseason is nearing yet another important deadline -- one that's certain to see some notable players join the free-agent ranks. Teams have until Friday, Nov. 22, to decide which arbitration-eligible players they'll tender a contract to for next season, and which they'll allow to become free agents earlier than expected. You may have heard of the concept of ""non-tendering"" a player. If so (or even if not), allow us to break it down into more malleable terms. Most players become eligible for arbitration after logging three years of service time. (Some earn that designation after two years -- these are called ""Super Two"" players.) From there, they're afforded the opportunity to make more money than the league minimum they earned beforehand. The downside to earning more money, if one exists, is that teams are more likely to sever ties with that player if they feel their salary outpaces their production. In turn, that can result in the player being non-tendered, or freed from their commitment to their team at no cost (financial or otherwise) to the club itself. Being non-tendered doesn't necessarily mean the player is done or useless. Last year's crop included, among others, lefty reliever Tim Hill, right-handers Spencer Turnbull and Cooper Criswell, and infielder Nick Senzel. Each had a productive 2024 in their own ways. Just who might find themselves attempting to follow on those players' cleatprints come 2025? Below, we've highlighted 10 players we think are bubble cases. In each instance, we've rendered a prediction on whether or not the player will be tendered. It should be noted that this is more of an art than a science, and that this article uses the arbitration prizes projected by Matt Swartz's model at MLB Trade Rumors. Now, to the reason you clicked.  McCormick is fresh off a career-worst showing that saw him lose more than 50 points from each of the triple-slash categories. His underlying measures didn't fare much better: he struck out more often and walked and barrelled the ball less often. Nonetheless, there's enough track record and upside here (even now he's sporting a career 108 OPS+) that we suspect the Astros are OK tendering him a contract and seeing if he can rebound in what will serve as his age-30 season. Prediction: Tendered Manoah is only two seasons removed from finishing third in Cy Young Award balloting. You can be forgiven if it feels as though far more time has elapsed. Manoah performed better this past season than he did in 2023, albeit in a limited sample. He made just five big-league appearances (and 10 overall) before succumbing to season-ending elbow surgery. Manoah is expected to miss at least the beginning of the 2025 campaign as well. The Blue Jays have several more seasons of team control on the line, suggesting that they'll keep him around through at least one more winter. Prediction: Tendered As with the aforementioned Manoah, it's been a long two years for McKenzie. Whereas he appeared to be a building block back in 2022, he's since posted an ERA over 5.00 in 20 big-league outings. He split this past year between the majors and the minors, showing reduced velocity and command. McKenzie is now 27 years old and out of options. We could see the Guardians deciding to move on. Prediction: Non-tendered A logical midseason acquisition that just didn't work out as planned. Hays appeared in 22 games with the Phillies after coming over from Baltimore, hitting .256/.275/.397 (86 OPS+) and missing time because of a hamstring injury and a kidney infection. Those ailments weren't his fault, of course, but we wonder if the Phillies would prefer to redirect the money earmarked for him toward a bigger fish. Prediction: Non-tendered This time a year ago, Bednar was coming off consecutive All-Star Game appearances and was a prime trade candidate. The Pirates held onto him instead and … well, here he is after a season that saw every part of his statistical profile worsen. We doubt the Pirates will sever ties through a non-tender. One source we spoke to predicted a trade was more likely. Should that come to fruition, it ought to serve as a reminder to non-contenders to always move elite relievers sooner than later. Prediction: Tendered The Rays added Carlson, a sensible buy-low candidate, in a minor deadline trade with the Cardinals. He started shockingly hot with Tampa Bay, posting an .836 OPS through his first 10 games that made it seem like his long-awaited breakout had arrived. He then cratered from there, hitting .212/.280/.259 in his subsequent 27 contests to round out the year. We could see this one going either way: even the Rays can afford a $2.7 million gamble, but it's hard for us to argue Carlson merits the investment given his big-league career to date. Prediction: Non-tendered Vaughn, the No. 3 pick in the 2019 draft, is nearing his age-27 season. My, how the time flies. Unfortunately for Vaughn, he hasn't affirmed his amateur hype. He'll embark on the new year having delivered a 101 OPS+ over the course of his first four big-league seasons. There's not much underlying reason to believe that better days are coming, though the White Sox may conclude they're fine giving him one more bite at the apple before getting serious about finding an upgrade at the cold corner. Prediction: Tendered Blackburn appeared five times for the Mets after coming over from Oakland in a deadline trade. He missed all of September and the entirety of New York's run to the NLCS after experiencing a spinal fluid leak in his back. That doesn't sound particularly pleasant to us. What's worse is that the Mets, who nailed almost all of their pitching bets last winter, might decide they'd rather have the $4 million to throw at a pitcher with a little better track record of durability. Prediction: Non-tendered Three full seasons have passed since Baddoo posted a two-win season and appeared to be a Rule 5 success story in the making. During that period, he's played in 216 games and has compiled a .619 OPS. Baddoo is still on the younger side (he celebrated his 26th birthday back in August), but we think the Tigers will pass on paying him this kind of coin -- especially after making a surprise playoff run. Prediction: Non-tendered The Rockies reportedly desire to reduce their payroll ahead of next season. Shedding Quantrill's potential $9 million commitment would be one way to do that. Although he got off to a good start, he was terrible down the stretch. In seven appearances across August and September, he surrendered 23 runs on 37 hits while walking more batters (24) than he struck out (20). We doubt the Rockies will even be able to find a trade partner given Quantrill's cost, leaving them with just one option. Prediction: Non-tendered"

They will welcome the Dallas Mavericks  at 10:00  p.m.  ET on Friday at Ball Arena. Coming in fresh off a  win as the underdog, the Nuggets will stroll into this one as the favorite.  Last Tuesday, the Nuggets beat the Grizzlies 122-110.  The Nuggets' success was the result of a balanced attack that saw several players step up, but  Jamal Murray led the charge by  posting 27 points plus six  assists and three  steals. What's more,  Murray also racked up five  threes, the most he's  had since back in April.  The Nuggets were working as a unit and  finished the game with 29  assists (they're ranked second in  assists per game overall). They easily outclassed their opponents in that department as the Grizzlies only racked up 24.  Meanwhile,  winning is always nice, but doing so behind a season-high score is even better  (just ask the Mavericks). They steamrolled past the Pelicans 132-91  on Tuesday. The  victory was familiar territory for Dallas who have now won three  matches in a row.  Luka Doncic was the offensive standout of the  matchup as he  went 10 for 16 en route to 26 points plus five  assists and five  rebounds. He had some trouble finding  his footing against the Spurs on Saturday, so this was a step in the right direction.  Denver is  on a roll lately: they've  won six of their last eight contests,  which provided a nice bump to their 8-5 record  this season. As for Dallas, they now  have a winning record of 8-7.  The Nuggets came out on top in a nail-biter against the Mavericks when the teams last played  two weeks ago, sneaking past  122-120. One of the biggest obstacles the team faced in that game was  the Mavericks'  Kyrie Irving, who  went 6 for 8 from beyond the arc en route to 43 points plus five  assists and five  rebounds. Now that he's  got a second chance to win this matchup, will the Nuggets still be able to contain  Irving? There's only one way to find out.  Denver is a 3-point favorite against Dallas, according to the latest NBA odds. Bettors have moved against the Nuggets slightly, as the game opened with the Nuggets as a 4.5-point favorite. The over/under is 226.5  points. See NBA picks for every single game, including this one, from SportsLine's advanced computer model. Get picks now.

The Argentines fought back to edge Corinthians 4-3 on aggregate in the semifinals while the Brazilians narrowly overcame Lanus 1-0 to advance 2-1 over two legs. Racing Club will make their first appearance at a continental final since the 1989 Recopa Sudamericana which they lost 1-0 to Nacional of Uruguay. Gustavo Costas's men are in good form with five consecutive wins across all competitions and a win here would bring a first CONMEBOL title since the 1967 Copa Libertadores.  The last Argentine side to win the Copa Sudamericana was Defensa y Justicia back in 2020 while Racing have not lost to Brazilian opponents at home this edition. However, Cruzeiro overcame Lanus in Buenos Aires to get here and could put that record to the test. Fernando Diniz has never lost in a CONMEBOL final at club level with Fluminense winning the Copa Libertadores one year ago and the 2024 Recopa Sudamericana. Cruzeiro, though, have lost two of their last three games across all competitions. With only one goal conceded in six away Sudamericana games, a 1-0 loss to Boca Juniors in the round of 16 is their only loss on the road. Brazilian sides have lost the last two Sudamericana finals with Athletico Paranaense the last to buck that trend in 2021 and Cruzeiro 's last continental success came in 1997's Copa Libertadores. Here's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more: Racing topped Group H with five wins from six and just one loss for the top seeding before demolishing Chile's Huachipato 8-1 on aggregate in the round of 16. Then it was overcoming Brazil's Athletico Paranaense 4-2 over two legs in the quarterfinals before edging Corinthians 4-3 in the semifinals to get here. Cruzeiro topped Group B with three wins and three draws from six for the seventh of  eight seeded berths before needing penalties to oust Boca Juniors in the round of 16 after a 2-2 draw over two legs. A 3-1 win over Paraguay's Libertad in the quarterfinals followed before the 2-1 triumph against Lanus in the semifinals which booked this date. Racing: Roger Martinez and Santiago Solari came in last time out but are unlikely to start ahead of Maximiliano Salas and the tournament's joint-top goal scorer Adrian Martinez here. Juan Fernando Quintero's brace advanced them this far and he should also start just behind the front two. Possible Racing XI: Arias; Martirena, Di Cesare, Garcia Basso, Rojas; Almendra, Sosa, Nardoni; Quintero, A. Martinez, Salas. Cruzeiro: Rafa Silva is injured and likely to miss out while Gabriel Veron, Matheus Pereira and Kaio Jorge are eligible despite domestic suspension last weekend. Jorge was the semifinal hero while Cassio kept his second clean sheet of the competition to get here and both will also start. Possible Cruzeiro XI: Cassio; William, Marcelo, Villalba, Xavier; Romero, Walace; Veron, Pereira, Diaz; Jorge. It should be tight but something has to give so do not be surprised if Racing nick it by a goal despite Cruzeiro's solid defense. Pick: Racing 2, Cruzeiro 1."

While the playoff races are starting to take over the talk of the league, the injury reports are also piling up as all 32 teams enter the home stretch. Let's take a look at how each NFL team is faring from a health standpoint. Below is a rundown of every team's initial injury report entering this week's games.  Cornerback Marshon Lattimore hasn't practiced since joining the Commanders and once again didn't practice Friday. He will be out against the Cowboys. The Chiefs will once again be without running back Isiah Pacheco, despite reports that he was expected to be back. All NFL sports betting odds courtesy of BetMGM. The Panthers had a lengthy injury report this week. Kicker Eddy Pineiro, who is the league's most accurate kicker of all-time, is questionable after not practicing Friday. Running back Miles Sanders is the only player out ahead of Sunday, as he didn't practice all week, while wide receiver Adam Thielen was limited all week and is questionable.  The Chiefs were expected to get running back Isiah Pacheco (ankle) back this week, but the team announced he is out. With a short week ahead of them -- they play the Raiders on Black Friday -- the Chiefs' coaches and trainers felt it was best for Pacheco to remain sidelined, despite him being healthy enough to play. Charles Omenihu (IR) is also out.  The Vikings had quarterback Sam Darnold (foot) listed on the initial injury report, but he was a full participant Thursday and Friday after being limited Wednesday. He has no game designation. Running back Aaron Jones (ribs) was a full participant in practice all week and is clear to play. A surprise to see running back D'Andre Swift on the injury report for the Bears, as he's battling a groin injury and is questionable. Swift did not practice Wednesday and was limited the rest of the week.  The Titans had quite a few players listed on the injury report. Cornerback L'Jarius Sneed and running rack Tyjae Spears are among those sidelined this Sunday.  For the Texans, pass rusher Will Anderson Jr. (ankle) was limited to start the week after he missed last week's game, but was a full participant Friday and has no game designation. Cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. was also limited Wednesday and Thursday, but improved as a full participant by Friday. As you can see, the Lions are dealing with injuries at cornerback. Fortunately for them, Moseley was a full practice participant throughout the week. Arnold was a full participant Friday after being limited Thursday.  Tackle Bernhard Raimann (knee) was the only nonparticipant to start the week and he is officially listed as out. Defensive end Tyquan Lewis was a full participant, but is questionable.  It would almost be easier to name the Patriots who aren't on the injury report. With the exception of Barmore, every Patriot with a questionable designation was limited during Friday's practice. Gonzalez was limited Friday after not appearing on the injury report on Wednesday and Thursday.  For the Dolphins, Armstead didn't practice all week, while McMorris was questionable despite being a full practice participant all week. Ingold and Wynn were limited Friday.  The Buccaneers are expected to have wide receiver Mike Evans (hamstring) back Sunday, as he was a limited participant Friday after practicing in full the previous day. Conversely, Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers did not practice Friday due to a groin injury and is questionable. Kayvon Thibodeaux was limited Wednesday but was a full participant the rest of the week.  All-Pro cornerback DaRon Bland is set to make his season debut after not getting an injury designation for Sunday. Also suiting up for the Cowboys is wideout CeeDee Lamb, who showed up on the injury report this week with back and foot injuries.  The Commanders will be without Marshon Lattimore, who hasn't practiced since he was traded to the team. Each of Washington's questionable players were full practice participants Friday.  Allen's loss would be significant as he is one of the Broncos' top defenders with five sacks and a dozen tackles for loss through 11 games. Jordan Jackson, a 2022 sixth-round pick, is slate to start in the event that Allen can't go.  The Raiders are hurt at several positions, including at running back. Backups Ameer Abdullah and Dylan Laube are in line to split the reps in the event that White and Mattison can't go.  With Purdy out, veteran quarterback Brandon Allen will start in his place. Allen, 32, has attempted just three passes in a regular season game over the past three years. His last start in the NFL occurred in 2021 as a member of the Cincinnati Bengals. Allen has nine career starts under his belt, going 2-7.  For the Packers, Eric Stokes is slated to start in place of Alexander. A former first-round pick, Stokes has made six starts this season.  Each of Arizona's questionable players were limited during Friday's practice. In Seattle, both Fant and Shenault practiced in full Friday, which is obviously a good sign for Sunday's game.  Eagles edge rusher Bryce Huff (wrist) did not practice this week as he underwent wrist surgery. With Smith out, expect a bigger workload Sunday from fellow wideout A.J. Brown, tight ends Dallas Goedert and Grant Calcaterra and running back Saquon Barkley.  They're not out of the woods, but the Rams' injury situation is significantly better than it was during the season's first month. If Havenstein can't go, Warren McClendon Jr. is in line to start in his place. A 2023 fifth-round pick, McClendon has already made three starts this season.  Analysis to come"

The only remaining player from Orlando's previous playoff run in 2017, the Brazilian is playing in her first NWSL final ever with a chance to cement her legacy. But at 38 and being out of contract at the end of the season, there are questions about what's next for her. Earlier in the season, Marta hinted that this could be her final season in Orlando, and reflecting on the season with CBS Sports, the subject came up again.  ""It's been eight years here with Orlando, and it's the first time that we go to a final. It's a coincidence, but I don't know. It's some answer for me, for myself. Why am I still here,"" Marta said. ""Why am I looking to build something special for this team? I don't know if I'm going to be here next year, but I'm already so happy with what I have given to the club and the players."" A post shared by Attacking Third (@attackingthird) Marta reflected on how special this season has been for Orlando with the club setting records left and right. Marta became the oldest goal scorer and oldest outfield player in club history. Barbra Banda became the team's record scorer in all competitions for NWSL with 16 goals. They set a record for the biggest win in club history, the longest shutout streak in club history and so much more en route to winning the NWSL Shield while they now look to do the double.  ""No matter what happens in the final, this season for me and for the team has been the best season so far. Orlando never had played a consistent game as we have done in this season from beginning to end,"" Marta said, as she began to hold back tears. If this is Marta's final season in Orlando, she'll be able to go out on top with a lasting legacy but first, there's another trophy in her sights to close out this season on the highest note possible."

Most of the key pieces returned this year, minus Kamilla Cardoso, who is now with the WNBA's Chicago Sky. The most dangerous element of last season's squad was its depth. The same can be said for the 2024-25 Gamecocks, as six players are averaging more than seven points per game thus far. Ahead of the season, Staley said her program is ""next woman up"" and gave fans a heads up that Chloe Kitts, who averaged less than 20 minutes per game last season, was one of the players who made the biggest jump this offseason. Now, Kitts is leading the team with 14 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. A player who is not in the starting lineup but is certainly impactful is MiLaysia Fulwiley, who Staley often describes as a generational talent. She is averaging 12.8 points, and her impressive athletic abilities are exactly why she is described as a walking highlight reel. Meanwhile, freshman Joyce Edwards is showing a lot of potential already with 9.6 points and 5.2 boards per game. The Gamecocks earned a program-record 43rd straight win with a 77-45 victory over Clemson on Wednesday. Earlier this season, South Carolina also became the second Division I team to reach multiple 40-game winning streaks, joining UConn, which has done so four times. UCLA is coming off a 101-52 win against Arkansas, which marked the highest point total and largest point differential for the team so far this season. Like the Gamecocks, the Bruins boast significant depth with seven players averaging double figures, and their 84.8 points per game places them 26th nationally.  Lauren Betts is leading the team with 21.5 points and 11.5 rebounds per game. She has been a star at UCLA since last season, but coach Cori Close also benefited from top returners like Kiki Rice, Gabriela Jaquez and Londynn Jones.  One of the Bruins' biggest highlights this season has been Oregon State transfer Timea Gardiner, who ranks among the top 10 players nationally in 3-point percentage (57.7%). Her long-range shooting abilities were on full display against Arkansas, as Gardiner scored a career-high 23 points while going 7 of 12 from beyond the arc."

If they are to close the nine point gap on Liverpool they are going to need to get on the sort of winning run that has eluded them over the first 11 games of the campaign. Their first attempt could well be a tricky one. Nottingham Forest are the only team to have beaten the league leaders so far this season and their resolute defense has fired them into fifth spot in the table, trailing the Gunners only on goal difference. Not since March 1989 have Forest won at Arsenal in the league, but Nuno Espirito Santo's side are impressive road operators with five wins and two draws from their last seven. Making that six from eight would be quite the way to spoil Mikel Arteta's big day as he celebrates 250 games in charge of Arsenal. Here is how you can watch the match and what you need to know: Arsenal: The presence of Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice, Riccardo Calafiori and Leandro Trossard on the training field on Friday was welcome news for an Arsenal side whose injury problems never seem to fully ease. The latter limped out of Belgium's defeat to Israel but that proved to be a contact injury. Saka and Rice had not even joined up with England but Arteta confirmed they had had ""partial sessions"" while Calafiori, out for a month with a knee issue, is also on the comeback trail. Arteta meanwhile confirmed that Ben White will be out for ""months,"" CBS Sports understands between two and three of them. Takehiro Tomiyasu might have been able to ease the pressure on the right back position but he will be away from the club for several weeks after multiple setbacks in his recovery from a knee injury. ""He's one of the guys where the only thing he wants to do is to work 24 hours to get better and he feels terrible when he's not fit, so it's a real shame,"" said Arteta. ""We're going to give him the best opportunity to try and unlock something to help him to have him back as quickly as possible, but I think we need to be patient."" Possible Arsenal XI: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Rice, Odegaard, Merino; Saka, Havertz, Martinelli Nottingham Forest: Nuno opted to play his cards close to his chest in his pre-match press conference, stating that there's ""some situations to manage and decide"" in a squad that otherwise does not appear to have major issues. Ola Aina and Elliott Anderson both returned from international duty early but are expected to be available. Long term absentees Danilo and Ibrahima Sangare will not recover in time while there was some doubt about Ramon Sosa, yet to arrive back from international duty when Nuno spoke to the media. Whoever takes the field for Forest, confidence and belief will surely be high even after their defeat to Newcastle before the international break. ""What I expect and what the players give to us is total commitment to do things right,"" said Nuno. ""From the outside it can be surprising but for us? No. We work every day with them, we know the quality and talent they have, we demand a lot from them but we have to stay humble and realise it's a very long and tough season."" Possible Forest XI: Sels; Aina, Milenkovic, Murillo, Moreno; Yates, Dominguez; Elanga, Gibbs-White, Hudson-Odoi; Wood This could be a slog for Arsenal against a very good defensive opponent but Martin Odegaard's presence might just offer enough for them to carry the day. PICK: Arsenal 2, Nottingham Forest 1"
CBSSports.com Headlines,"Daniel Jones released: Cowboys' Mike McCarthy, Stephen Jones address possibility of adding former Giants QB",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/daniel-jones-released-cowboys-mike-mccarthy-stephen-jones-address-possibility-of-adding-former-giants-qb/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 22:21:49 +0000",McCarthy didn't seem interested in adding an ex-NFC East rival to his quarterback room,"The Dallas Cowboys (3-7) are off to their worst 10-game start to a season since 2020 when they also started 3-7. The common thread is that quarterback Dak Prescott suffered season-ending injuries in both seasons, fracturing his ankle in 2020 and tearing his hamstring in 2024.  Dallas has opted to roll with Cooper Rush, the eight-year veteran backup, in Prescott's absence this year. Despite losing by a combined score of 68-16 in his two starts in Week 10 vs. the Philadelphia and in Week 11 vs. the Houston Texans, they are sticking with him as the starter in Week 12 at the Washington Commanders, a reunion game with former defensive coordinator Dan Quinn who is now Washington's coach. The Cowboys will also have packages for backup quarterback Trey Lance, the San Francisco 49ers' third overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft whom they acquired for the price of a fourth-round pick at the end of the 2023 preseason. They also brought in veteran Will Grier to be their third, emergency quarterback, but Dallas, along with the NFL's 31 other teams, has a shot to add a six-year NFL veteran with plenty of starting experience in quarterback Daniel Jones.  The New York Giants released Jones on Friday after benching him for Tommy DeVito, so CBS Sports asked Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy about the chance to add Jones just before Dallas plays New York on Thanksgiving Day in Week 13. Dallas doing so would provide the NFL world with peak Turkey Day drama, but McCarthy indicated such a move likely won't be happening.  ""I've never really been in the business of looking at players based off the team they are released from, especially with the timing of the next game,"" McCarthy said on a conference call on Friday. ""He was a prospect I really liked coming out, but we kind of have our head down right now and really focused on working with the guys we have here.""     Cowboys EVP Stephen Jones later echoed McCarthy's sentiments when asked about the possibility of Jones coming to Dallas.  ""No, I think we're in good shape at our quarterback spot,"" Jones said. ""We think Cooper (Rush) gives us the best chance to win right now. And certainly we still want to see some. We'll kind of see how the season goes here. We still really want to see (Trey) Lance and like what he brings to the table. And then, of course, long term, we all know we made our commitment to Dak (Prescott) for the long term."" The Giants made Jones the sixth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft out of Duke, and his highwater mark came in 2022, the first season under current coach Brian Daboll. Jones produced career highs in passing yards (3,205), passing yards per attempt (6.8) and passer rating (92.5). He also threw a career-low five interceptions that season en route to the Giants going 9-6-1 and reaching the postseason. Daboll won NFL Coach of the Year that season, and Jones helped lead New York to an NFC wild-card round road victory at the Minnesota Vikings. He threw for 301 yards and two touchdowns on 24 of 35 passing, and he added another 78 yards on the ground on 17 carries. Jones is the only player in NFL history to throw for over 300 yards passing and multiple touchdowns while rushing for at least 70 yards in a single postseason game.    Throughout his career, he has been plagued by turnovers and inefficiency. His 73 turnovers since entering the NFL in 2019 are tied for the fifth-most in the league in that span despite missing the final 11 games of the 2023 season with a torn ACL.  Among 28 NFL quarterbacks with at least 1,500 passes thrown since Jones entered the NFL in 2019, his 84.3 career passer rating ranks as second-worst ahead of only Sam Darnold's 82.3 passer rating. The Giants started 2-8 this season with Jones ranking last in the NFL among quarterbacks with at least 10 starts in both touchdown passes (eight) and passer rating (79.4)."
CBSSports.com Headlines,49ers' Brock Purdy out vs. Packers with shoulder injury; Brandon Allen to start at QB in Week 12,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/49ers-brock-purdy-out-vs-packers-with-shoulder-injury-brandon-allen-to-start-at-qb-in-week-12/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 22:17:35 +0000",San Francisco's injury woes continue,"The San Francisco 49ers have battled injuries to some of their best weapons this season, and that trend continued this week, with quarterback Brock Purdy nursing a shoulder issue ahead of Week 12. 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan announced Friday that Brandon Allen will start in place of Purdy for Sunday's game against the Packers. Allen joined the 49ers in 2023 after three seasons backing up Joe Burrow with the Cincinnati Bengals. Shanahan only revealed Purdy's injury on Monday, a day after the 49ers lost to Seattle, indicating the third-year quarterback was battling soreness. The 2023 NFC champion notably suffered a serious elbow injury in the final game of his rookie campaign, but made 16 starts last year, serving as a beacon of durability. After being a limited participant in practice Wednesday, Purdy left Thursday's practice early and was not available to the media afterward, though Shanahan suggested later that the signal-caller could still be ready for Sunday's game. ""He was still limited today,"" Shanahan said Thursday on KNBR 680. ""He didn't do as much yesterday but did a little bit more today. He went out there and did a little bit, then went back in about halfway through and rested up. Hopefully [his shoulder] will be feeling great on Sunday.""    The coach's comments came after Purdy was not seen in the 49ers' post-practice locker room, despite Thursdays marking his typical weekly media appearances. San Francisco's other quarterbacks -- Allen and Joshua Dobbs -- were also unavailable for questions. While Shanahan was optimistic about Purdy on Thursday, Purdy was not on the field during the portion of Friday's practice open to the media. It wasn't long after that he was ruled out for Sunday's crucial game in Green Bay."
CBSSports.com Headlines,"Where to watch Manchester City vs. Tottenham Hotspur live stream: Premier League online, TV, prediction, odds",https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/where-to-watch-manchester-city-vs-tottenham-hotspur-live-stream-premier-league-online-tv-prediction-odds/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 22:15:09 +0000",Pep Guardiola aiming to get Citizens back on track after securing future,"Manchester City will aim to close the five-point gap to Liverpool at the Premier League summit on Saturday when they meet Tottenham Hotspur at Etihad Stadium. Both sides suffered losses before the November international break with Pep Guardiola's men beaten 2-1 by Brighton and Hove Albion while Ange Postecoglou's side went down by the same score against Ipswich Town. City confirmed on Thursday that Guardiola is staying on for two more years while a number of first team regulars are closing on their return to full fitness. The defending EPL champions are preparing for eight difficult games in 29 days with six Premier League and two UEFA Champions League outings in that run. Spurs are first up with City beating the Londoners just three times from their last 10 encounters but will be keen to return to Etihad Stadium after four away losses -- they are unbeaten across 52 games in all competitions at their Manchester home with 35 of those in the EPL. Tottenham are in 10th although just three points back on Chelsea in third and Spurs beat City in the EFL Cup recently which could aid them here. Postecoglou's men have 17 points from 10 Premier League meetings with the Citizens, but have scored at least two goals on each of their last three visits to Etihad Stadium. Just four wins from 18 away games in the EPL tells its own story, though, and no topflight sides has lost more on the road since March than Spurs. Here's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more: Guardiola and City suffered a fourth consecutive defeat for the first time in his managerial career and the last time that the Citizens suffered this sort of losing streak was back in 2006 when Stuart Pearce was in charge. Consecutive Premier League losses which also included a 2-1 defeat to Bournemouth means that City are five points behind Liverpool after 11 games and off the pace in their pursuit of a fifth straight title. Spurs were flying high 12 months ago, but are 10 points and eight positions worse off this time around with five wins, one draw and five losses from 11 EPL games. Extend that beyond the English topflight and Tottenham have four wins and four losses from their last eight games across all competitions. City: Injured Rodri will be present to celebrate his Ballon d'Or success while Oscar Bobb also remains out long-term. Jack Grealish, Kevin De Bruyne, John Stones, Manuel Akanji and Phil Foden have all trained so could make the cut along with Ruben Dias, Jeremy Doku, Nathan Ake and Matheus Nunes. Stones, Akanji and Dias coming back would really boost the defense with Jahmai Simpson-Pusey dropping out and Josko Gvardiol moving to left-back while Rico Lewis and Kyle Walker seek the right-back spot. Erling Haaland will lead the line after a strong international break with Norway while Mateo Kovacic, Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva are all fit to start. Possible City XI: Ederson; Walker, Stones, Akanji, Gvardiol; Kovacic, Gundogan; Bernardo, Foden, Savinho; Haaland. Spurs: Rodrigo Bentancur got a seven-match ban for comments regarding teammate Son Heung-min and Spurs have since appealed. Micky van de Ven, Richarlison and Wilson Odobert are all out while Cristian Romero has a foot problem. Ben Davies could partner Radu Dragusin in central defense while Yves Bissouma could come in for Bentancur next to Dejan Kulusevski and one of Pape Matar Sarr or James Maddison. Possible Spurs XI: Vicario; Porro, Dragusin, Davies, Udogie; Kulusevski, Bissouma, Sarr; Johnson, Solanke, Son. This one should be tight and could easily finish 2-2 but a narrow City win with Spurs' run of two or more goals at Etihad Stadium feels about right. Pick: City 2, Spurs 1."

The Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers will still open the 2025 season with two games in Tokyo. Those will be the only international games on the schedule next year. ""We're not going to San Juan. We did not have, despite a lot of  efforts, an arrangement that made economic sense for us. We'd like to do San Juan and what's available kind of changes  year to year, and I hope it all works out in the future,"" Manfred said (via the Associated Press). ""... I'm sure we'll be back (to Mexico City) during the term of this agreement. We had a really, really aggressive international-play undertaking last  season. Obviously, we're opening in Tokyo. Tokyo is really our focus  right now for very, very good business reasons."" The ""agreement"" Manfred referred to is the current collective bargaining agreement, which expires after the 2026 season. The CBA called for an opening series in Tokyo, a May series in Mexico City, a June series in Paris, and a September series in San Juan this season. The Paris games were canceled last November because MLB was unable to find a promoter. Basically, MLB has determined it won't make enough money to play these games, so they've been canceled. Earlier this year the Dodgers and San Diego Padres played MLB's first ever regular-season games in South Korea. The Colorado Rockies and Houston Astros played two games in Mexico City in April, and the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies played two games in London in June. MLB also played games in Mexico City in 2023 and in London in 2019 and 2022. The league played 49 games in San Juan from 2001-18. For 2026, the CBA calls for games to be played in Mexico City in May, London in June, and San Juan in September. Also, 2026 is a World Baseball Classic year, so the baseball calendar will begin with a 20-team international tournament. The 2025 MLB schedule was released in July."

Purdue is 2-8 and Michigan State is 4-6 against the spread this season. Kickoff in East Lansing is scheduled for 8 p.m. ET. The Spartans are favored by 14 points in the latest Purdue vs. Michigan State odds via SportsLine consensus, while the over/under is 48.5 points.

Here are the college football odds and college football betting lines for Michigan State vs. Purdue: The Spartans have far more on the line in this late-season matchup. With wins over Purdue and Rutgers in their season finale, they can qualify for a bowl game in head coach Jonathan Smith's first year on the job. For a program going through a rebuild with a young quarterback, the extra bowl game practices could prove to be priceless.  Sophomore Aidan Chiles is extremely talented and has the skill set to be an upper-echelon Big Ten quarterback. Chiles, who followed Smith from Oregon State, is coming off his best game in a Spartans uniform. Against a strong Illinois defense, Chiles threw for 256 yards and two touchdowns, while rushing for 40 yards on 12 carries. See which team to pick here. The Boilermakers have a chance to play the role of spoilers against Michigan State. With a win on Friday night, Purdue would eliminate the Spartans from postseason contention. A victory in East Lansing would also send Purdue into the offseason with a renewed sense of optimism.  Not a lot has gone well for Purdue this season, but a couple of bright spots have been running back Devin Mockobee and tight end Max Klare. Mockobee has rushed for 652 yards and three touchdowns on 115 carries. Klare enters Friday with 39 catches for 566 yards and three scores. See which team to pick here.

Also on the main card, women's strawweight fighters take the spotlight as Yan Xiaonan (-185) takes on Tabitha Ricci (+155). Before making any UFC Fight Night: Yan vs. Figueiredo picks, be sure to see the UFC Fight Night: Yan vs. Figueiredo predictions and best bets from SportsLine's Daniel Vithlani.

He later lost his title to Aljamain Sterling at UFC 259 in March 2021. In 22 career matches, Yan has posted a 17-5 record, including seven wins by knockout.

We'll reveal one of Vithlani's UFC Fight Night: Yan vs. Figueiredo selections here: He is backing Quang Le (+125) to upset Long Xiao (-150) in a bantamweight matchup on the preliminary card.      ""Le is an exciting power-puncher with a nasty left hook and dangerous head kicks,"" Vithlani told SportsLine. ""Le lost his UFC debut to ranked bantamweight Chris Guttierez, but he'll get a much different stylistic matchup Saturday. Xiao is a grinding fighter who likes to pressure forward, clinch up and keep his opponents controlled. He has decent boxing, but he is hittable and often finds himself in close fights. Xiao's clinch-heavy style has resulted in three straight split-decision results, the most recent of which he lost. If Le can defend takedowns and land power punches when Xiao tries to tangle up with him, he will have the bigger moments and win this fight.""

CBSSports.com Headlines,"College football picks, schedule: Predictions against the spread, odds for NCAA top 25 games in Week 13",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-picks-schedule-predictions-against-the-spread-odds-for-ncaa-top-25-games-in-week-13/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 23:45:31 +0000",A closer look at the top games for the 13th week of the 2024 college football season,"The college football season is running out of time. This week brings us the last truly full Saturday slate of college football games; next week will feature a healthy Black Friday schedule. That also means teams are running out of time to achieve their goals, whether it's to win their conference, get to the College Football Playoff or simply earn a bowl game berth. And there are no shortage of big games on the slate this weekend.  The biggest matchup of the day is also one of the earliest as No. 2 Ohio State hosts No. 5 Indiana in a game that has major implications in both the Big Ten and playoff picture. In the afternoon, we'll see No. 21 Arizona State host No. 14 BYU in what essentially serves as a Big 12 title elimination game. We'll finish the evening with an undefeated No. 19 Army team trying to pull off the unthinkable and topple No. 6 Notre Dame. All in all, there are 19 teams who still have a chance to reach the playoff or win their league in action on Saturday. Be sure to stick with CBS Sports all day Saturday for college football coverage from the opening kickoff onward. Let's take a look at our expert picks for the best games in Week 13 with cited picks from best sports betting apps available.                                  All times Eastern  Noon | Fox, fubo (Try for free) -- I have concerns about both sides here. Ohio State is banged up on the offensive line and lost starting center Seth McLaughlin to a torn Achilles in practice this week. It's fair to wonder how well a MASH unit of an offensive line will perform against the Hoosiers. At the same time, Indiana's worst offensive performance of the season came in its last game against Michigan, which was also the best defense the Hoosiers faced all year. This Ohio State defense is better than Michigan, so it's also fair to wonder how successful the Hoosiers offense will be. Put those two together and the under feels like the best play on sports betting apps. Pick: Under 51.5 (Fanatics Sportsbook) -- Tom Fornelli  Noon | ESPN, fubo (Try for free) -- The Gators are nearly 90 yards per game better on defense at home, and last week they held LSU to 4.1 yards per play -- their best performance against an FBS team this season. Ole Miss, however, seems to have cut back on the mistakes at inopportune times and the offense is clicking again. The Rebels average 7.6 yards per play, the second-best average in the country behind Miami, which blew out the Gators at home in their season opener. Florida is better than it was in September and will show up again Saturday, but the Rebels' defense has been on a tear (22 sacks in the last three games) and wins by a score. The betting line seems a little high. Pick: Florida +10.5 (Caesars Sportsbook) -- Brandon Marcello  3:30 p.m. | CBS, Paramount+ with Showtime, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App -- Penn State is rolling right now and has won its last three non-Ohio State games by at least 15 points. However, good defenses and aggressive passing offenses have caused issues at times. Against UCLA, the Nittany Lions only won by a 27-11 score. Illinois also held Penn State to 21 points, while Ohio State kept the PSU offense out of the end zone. Minnesota will be able to keep things close, hold onto the ball and come in under the betting line. Pick: Minnesota +11.5 (DraftKings Sportsbook) -- Shehan Jeyarajah  3:30 p.m. | ESPN, fubo (Try for free) -- Arizona State is playing its best football right now, while BYU has needed some last-minute, remarkable finishes to stay alive in the CFP picture. This is one of the biggest home games in recent memory for Arizona State, and it will mark only the second time in the last 10 years that Arizona State is a betting favorite against a ranked opponent. The Sun Devols were a 3-point favorite against BYU in 2021 and lost outright 27-17. Arizona State wins this behind a big game from Skattebo. Pick: Arizona State -3 (BetMGM Sportsbook) -- Cameron Salerno  3:30 p.m. | Fox, fubo (Try for free) -- Kansas is one of the hottest teams in the country, but sportsbooks have already caught up. A 3-point line doesn't provide much value as Colorado tries to keep their Big 12 title hopes alive. While KU's secondary will provide some serious problems, Colorado simply has too much firepower and too much on the line to lose this game. Expect it to go down to the wire, though. Pick: Colorado -3 (FanDuel Sportsbook) -- Jeyarajah  7 p.m. | NBC, fubo (Try for free) -- Army has enjoyed a great year thus far, and the Black Knights are a good team. But we've already seen a similar game play out this year when Notre Dame beat Navy 51-14. While Army looks like a more complete team than Navy did at any point, the same issues should arise for the Black Knights. Simply put: Notre Dame has a significant size advantage in the trenches. The Irish also have the athletes to cover the edges and erase a lot of what Army's triple option tries to accomplish to compensate for the size disparity. So long as Notre Dame can stick to its assignments and not get wrapped up in any motion, this should be a comfortable win. Pick: Notre Dame -14.5 (DraftKings Sportsbook) -- Will Backus  7:30 p.m. | NBC, fubo (Try for free) -- While Oklahoma's offense has fallen well short of expectations on the whole and been very up-and-down through quarterback and coordinator changes during the season, the Sooners' defense has remained remarkably consistent. I think that group will answer the challenge of facing Jalen Milroe, and with the help of a rowdy home crowd, limit the Crimson Tide's offensive output. I don't think Oklahoma can score enough to win the game outright, but it can keeps the game's total points under the betting line. Pick: Under 47.5 (Fanatics Sportsbook) -- Chip Patterson  SportsLine's proven computer model is calling for 12 outright upsets in Week 13 of college football. Visit SportsLine now to see them all, plus get spread picks for every game from the model that simulates every matchup 10,000 times."
CBSSports.com Headlines,What's at stake between Washington Spirit vs. Orlando Pride: Marta's last ride? Seb Hines shoots for history,https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/whats-at-stake-between-washington-spirit-vs-orlando-pride-martas-last-ride-seb-hines-shoots-for-history/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 21:23:35 +0000","The NWSL Championship will be a historic event, no matter which side wins","Legacies are on the line as the Washington Spirit and Orlando Pride meet in Kansas City for the NWSL final. The Pride could win their first title in club history while the Spirit look to become only the fifth team in NWSL history to win multiple titles. Two of the best teams in the league this season, the Pride and the Spirt deserve the spotlight in what could be an epic final due to what's at stake on both sides. Soccer legend Marta has yet to hoist an NWSL title in her eighth season with Orlando but she's now one victory away from being able to do that at 38. It has been an impressive season fro the Brazillian and she looks to cap it off by leading he Pride to be the first team since 2019 to do the double winning the Shield in the regular season and triumphing in the NWSL final.  Head coach Seb Hines has already made history by becoming the first black coach in NWSL history, but becoming the first Black coach to win an NWSL championship would be a legacy defining moment.  ""I've always thought that it was my responsibility to show the way,"" Hines said on what this means. ""Hopefully this will show a way for more Black coaches in this league and other leagues."" The Washington Spirit weren't stopped by losing star midfielder and Rookie of the Year Croix Bethune to a season ending injury, but this final is a chance to win a final for her while also watching another star ascend before our eyes. Trinity Rodman has already become one of the faces of the league and after a season during which she scored eight goals and assisted six more, she'll be one of the top players that Hines is looking to stop. The Spirit's fight goes all the way up to their ownership as their first NWSL title came while Michele Kang was trying to take controlling ownership of the team. After becoming involved as a minority owner, Kang turned her eye to taking control of the team following abusive behavior by head coach Richie Burke after attempts to convince other members of the club's hierarchy that things needed to change didn't work. The players had to get involved in making a statement that the team should be sold to Kang instead of someone else and she has turned that into part of becoming a women's sports mogul. It's no surprise that with Kang's involvement, that the Spirit have become one of the top teams in the league and they could take another step with this NWSL championship.  No matter what this is a landmark final as even these callouts are only scratching the surface of how good these teams are and some of the stories behind them.  All times Eastern Saturday, Nov. 23Attacking Third pre-match show, 6:30 p.m. (CBS Sports Golazo Network)Attacking Third pre-match show, 7:30 p.m. (CBS, Paramount+)NWSL Championship: Orlando Pride vs. Washington Spirit, 8 p.m. (CBS, Paramount+)Attacking Third post-match show, 10:30 p.m. (CBS Sports Golazo Network) Sunday, Nov. 24NWSL Skills Challenge, 3 p.m. or 5 p.m. (check local listings) (CBS, Paramount+) No matter what happens in the NWSL Championship, history suggests that it will be a close one. The Spirit had to win a penalty shootout over NY/NJ Gotham to get here and they've had a penchant for critical equalizers and winners. In a match between closely matched sides, it's fair to expect it to go beyond 90 minutes of regulation. If you're not comfortable with picking a result, under 2.5 goals is also playable at -106 but there are too many star attackers involved in this final to hang my hat on that one."

UTSA is 5-5 overall and 3-3 in AAC play, while Temple is 3-7 and 2-4 in the AAC. UTSA is coming off a 48-27 win over North Texas on Friday for its second straight victory and the Roadrunners have scored more than 40 points in three straight games. They need one more win for bowl eligibility. Temple defeated Florida Atlantic, 18-15, in overtime on Saturday to snap a two-game losing skid. The victory wasn't enough to save the job of head coach Stan Drayton though, who was fired on Sunday. Defensive coordinator Everett Withers takes over as interim head coach for the Owls. Kickoff is at 7 p.m. ET from the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. After opening at -14.5, UTSA is now a 17-point favorite in the latest Temple vs. UTSA odds via SportsLine consensus, and the over/under is 56.5 points.

Temple put together a 15-play, 87-yard drive spanning 8:45, capped off by a Terrez Worthy 1-yard touchdown run. Temple had two fourth-down conversions on the series, which led to a 12-7 advantage with 7:15 left in the fourth quarter. That touchdown was sandwiched between made field goals after Temple missed a 51-yard field goal in its first possession of the second half. Kicker Maddux Trujillo redeemed himself from that miss with makes of 50 and 47 yards before nailing the winning 39-yard field goal in overtime in an 18-15 win over Florida Atlantic. Temple fired head coach Stan Drayton the day after the victory though. Defensive coordinator Everett Withers will serve as interim head coach, and coaching changes can sometimes spark a locker room to realize there are consequences for poor performances. Senior wide receiver Dante Wright had 14 receptions for 147 yards last week and will likely play a key role again on Friday. See which team to pick here. The Roadrunners have had one of the most productive offenses in college football this season and they've been especially dominant over recent weeks.

They have jumped out to a quick  43-36 lead against Illinois State.  McNeese has yet to string together two consecutive wins, but this may be their chance. For now, things are looking good for them.  Illinois State Redbirds @ McNeese Cowboys Current Records: Illinois State 3-1, McNeese 2-2  The Illinois State Redbirds will take on the McNeese Cowboys at 3:00  p.m.  ET on Friday at Virgin Islands Sport & Fitness Center. The Redbirds have been getting the ball to fall more lately as they've increased their point totals each of their last three games.  Illinois State is headed in fresh off scoring the most  points they have all season. They steamrolled past Trinity (Ill.) 107-52  on Sunday. The  game was pretty much decided by the half, when the score had already reached  44-23.  Illinois State was working as a unit and  finished the game with 26  assists. That's the most  assists they've posted  since  the start of last season.  Meanwhile,  there's no place like home for McNeese, who bounced back after a tough loss on the road  last Monday. They came out on top against North Texas by a score of  68-61  on Monday. The over/under was set at 129 points, so nice work oddsmakers; you were right on the money.  Joe Charles and  Sincere Parker were among the main playmakers for McNeese as the former  almost  dropped  a double-double on ten points and nine  rebounds and the latter  posted 18 points. Charles had some trouble finding his footing against Alabama  last Monday, so this was a nice turnaround.  Illinois State's win bumped their record up to 3-1. As for McNeese, their victory was  their 19th straight at home dating back to last season, which  pushed their record up to 2-2.  Some high-performance offense is likely on the agenda as  both  are some of the highest scoring teams in the league. Illinois State hasn't had any problem running up the score this season,  having  averaged 83.5 points per game. However, it's not like McNeese struggles in that department as   they've been averaging 79. With both teams so easily able to put up points, the only question left is who can run the score up higher.  Illinois State is hoping to beat the odds  on Friday, as the experts think they're headed for a loss.  McNeese is a big 10.5-point favorite against Illinois State, according to the latest college basketball odds. The line has drifted a bit towards the Cowboys, as the game opened with the Cowboys as a 8.5-point favorite. The over/under is 137  points.

The Pacers  struggled to get the ball back on offense and  finished the game with only three  offensive rebounds. That's the fewest  offensive rebounds they've posted since back in February.  Meanwhile, the Bucks strolled past the Bulls with  points to spare on Wednesday, taking the game  122-106. The  win made it back-to-back  victories for Milwaukee.  Giannis Antetokounmpo got back to being  his usual excellent self, as he  almost  dropped  a double-double on 41 points and nine  rebounds. He had some trouble finding his footing against the Rockets  on Monday, so this was a nice turnaround. Brook Lopez was another key player,  going 9 for 12 en route to 21 points plus five  rebounds and three  steals.  Indiana's loss was  their fourth straight on the road, which  dropped their record down to 6-9. As for Milwaukee, they have  been performing  well recently as they've  won four of their last five matches,  which provided a massive bump to their 6-9 record  this season.  The Pacers are hoping to beat the odds  on Friday, as the experts think they're headed for a loss. Bettors picking them against the spread  have some confidence (to put it mildly), as the team is sitting on  a four-game streak of failing to cover when  playing on the road.  The Pacers took their  victory against the Bucks  in their previous matchup  back in May by a conclusive  120-98. The rematch might be a little tougher for the Pacers since the  team won't have the home-court advantage this time around. We'll see if the change in venue makes a difference.  Milwaukee is a 5-point favorite against Indiana, according to the latest NBA odds. The oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Bucks as a 4-point favorite. The over/under is 237.5  points. See NBA picks for every single game, including this one, from SportsLine's advanced computer model. Get picks now.

The Hawks are expected to win (but not by much) so they better bring their A-game into this one.  The Hawks are headed into the  contest having just  suffered their biggest  loss since November 4th on Wednesday. They suffered a grim  120-97  defeat to the Warriors. Atlanta was in a tough position after the first half, with the score already sitting at  67-42.  Even though they lost, the Hawks  smashed the offensive glass and  finished the game with 21  offensive rebounds. That's the most  offensive rebounds they've posted since back in December of 2023.  Meanwhile, the Bulls ended up a good deal behind the Bucks on Wednesday and lost  122-106.  The Bulls'  loss came about despite a quality game from  Zach LaVine, who  went 9 for 15 en route to 27 points plus six  assists and five  rebounds. LaVine is trending in the right direction considering he's  improved his point production for three straight games.  Atlanta's defeat dropped their record down to 7-9. As for Chicago, they have  been struggling recently as they've  lost three of their last four matchups,  which put a noticeable dent in their 6-10 record  this season.  The Hawks came up short against the Bulls in their previous matchup  two weeks ago, falling  125-113. Can the Hawks avenge their  loss or is history doomed to repeat itself?

They will host the Portland Trail Blazers  at 8:00  p.m.  ET at Toyota Center. The timing is sure in the Rockets' favor as the  squad sits on six straight wins at home while the Trail Blazers have been banged up by three consecutive losses on the road.  The Rockets will bounce into Friday's   matchup after (finally) beating the Pacers, who they had gone 1-9 against in their ten prior meetings. The Rockets took down the Pacers 130-113  on Wednesday. Houston pushed the score to  98-77 by the end of the third, a deficit Indiana cut but never quite recovered from.  The Rockets' success was the result of a balanced attack that saw several players step up, but  Alperen Sengun led the charge by  dropping  a double-double on 31 points and 12  rebounds. Sengun had some trouble finding  his footing against the Bucks on Monday, so this was a step in the right direction. The team also got some help courtesy of  Jabari Smith, who  went 8 for 13 en route to 23 points plus eight  rebounds.  Meanwhile,  after a string of three wins, the Trail Blazers' good fortune finally ran out  on Wednesday. They fell  109-99 to the Thunder.  Even though they lost, the Trail Blazers  smashed the offensive glass and  finished the game with 16  offensive rebounds (they're ranked third in  offensive rebounds per game overall). That strong performance was nothing new for the team: they've now  pulled down at least ten  offensive rebounds in 24 consecutive  games  dating back to last season.  Houston is  on a roll lately: they've  won six of their last seven matches,  which provided a nice bump to their 11-5 record  this season. As for Portland, their loss dropped their record down to 6-9.  Friday's  contest is shaping up to be a scrappy  matchup:  The Rockets haven't given up the ball easily this season,  having  only  averaged 12.1  turnovers per game (they're ranked fifth in  turnovers per game overall). It's a different story for the Trail Blazers, though, as  they've been averaging 16.7. Given the Rockets' sizable advantage in that area, the Trail Blazers will need to find a way to close that gap.  The Rockets beat the Trail Blazers 116-107  in their previous matchup  back in April. Do  the Rockets have another victory up their sleeve, or will the Trail Blazers turn the tables on them?  We'll have the answer soon enough.  Houston is a big 12.5-point favorite against Portland, according to the latest NBA odds. The line on this game has moved quite a bit since it opened, as it started out with the Rockets as a 9.5-point favorite. The over/under is 224  points.

CBSSports.com Headlines,Kylian Mbappe early struggles with Real Madrid: Why it's not too soon to start worrying about the French star,https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/kylian-mbappe-early-struggles-with-real-madrid-why-its-not-too-soon-to-start-worrying-about-the-french-star/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 20:47:20 +0000",The French superstar is struggling to hit the heights in Spain and with Les Bleus,"It is safe to say that Kylian Mbappe's start to life with Real Madrid has not been what was imagined this summer by the Spanish giants but also the France international. After 11 appearances across all competitions with Los Blancos following his arrival as a free agent from Paris Saint-Germain, the 25-year-old has eight goals and two assists to his name. Although it is arguably not awful just yet, it is also not nearly as great as what had been expected of Mbappe upon his arrival at Santiago Bernabeu after the European champions' long pursuit. The former AS Monaco man was expected to dovetail perfectly with the likes of Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham, but it has been anything but simple for Real's head coach Carlo Ancelotti so far. If we dig deeper into the numbers which admittedly can only provide a fairly small sample size at this time, Mbappe's situation becomes even more alarming with three of those eight goals penalties. The French superstar is currently on a goalless run of four appearances, having already experienced a three-game streak before his double in a 2-0 win over Real Betis.  Mbappe's situation currently resembles that of Karim Benzema which was also a slow burner early on and the ex-France international's advice to his successor was to the point: ""The problem, in my opinion, is that [Mbappe] is not a central striker, even with the national team, every time he plays as a number nine he doesn't feel right, because that is not his position,"" Benzema told El Chiringuito.  ""On the left, he has got a guy who is at the same level as him, Vinicius, so there is a problem, you cannot play Vinicius as a number nine or on the right, because when he plays on the left he makes the difference in every game,"" the Ittihad Club man added. ""Mbappe is not a real number nine. People ask a lot of him and he is under a lot of pressure, this is not PSG."" ""Do not give up, because I do not think he is going to push Vinicius to move,"" Benzema offered Mbappe as advice. ""He is the best player in the world at the moment. Mbappe needs to get it into his head that today he is a number nine, and forget about the left flank for a while."" Adaptation periods are required, of course, but it is not simply the numbers that are cause for concern in the Spanish capital. Mbappe's on-field issues have had a detrimental impact on Real and his new teammates as well as his new boss. The Bondy native's inability to truly loom convincing when asked to play as a No. 9 has not only impacted Ancelotti's previously successful setup, but also disturbed Bellingham and Vini Jr. Multiple absences further back on the field have also played a part such as Dani Carvajal, Thibaut Courtois and lately Aurelien Tchouameni.  While Mbappe struggles, the Brazilian on the left flank remains Real's key man, and his performances have retained an impressive level of consistency in the face of strong positional rivalry. With 12 goals and five assists, the South American is carrying Los Merengues when his French teammate is unable to step up to the plate which has deepened pre-existing questions. Mbappe has been largely unconvincing since the FIFA 2022 World Cup in Qatar and what was arguably one of the best individual showings for a losing side in final in the tournament's history. Returning to life with PSG was difficult and his solitary season under Luis Enrique was impacted by the situation regarding his future which became increasingly clear was away from Parc des Princes. Add to that his odd situation with Les Bleus and the ongoing wage dispute with PSG, Real are right to feel underwhelmed. Focusing on returning to club action against Leganes in La Liga before a big UEFA Champions League clash with Liverpool could make a big difference after the November internationals with Mbappe's end to 2024 and start to 2025 potentially crucial to how his Real situation develops."

CBSSports.com Headlines,Fantasy Basketball Waiver Wire Week 6: If you're in need of scoring Jordan Clarkson is an excellent pickup,https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/fantasy-basketball-waiver-wire-week-6-if-youre-in-need-of-scoring-jordan-clarkson-is-an-excellent-pickup/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 20:34:50 +0000",Players you need to pick up for Week 6,"Welcome back! Once again, we've got a lot of names to choose from, including several players with the potential to stick on your rosters throughout the remainder of the season. As always, the players in this article must be rostered in less than two-thirds of CBS leagues. Players are listed in the order that I recommend adding them, assuming they are equally good fits for your team. Brandon Boston Jr., Pelicans (66% rostered), Jordan Clarkson, Jazz (67% rostered) By the time you're reading this, both of these guys might already be above our two-thirds Mendoza line, but just in case: Clarkson is scoring a ton and getting backup-point-guard-level assists; Boston is the only healthy Pelican (barely an exaggeration), leading to tons of minutes and contributions in every category except blocks. De'Andre Hunter, Hawks (60% rostered) It's been a frustrating ride, but the productivity is undeniable. The chronically injured Hunter has once again missed a ton of games, appearing in only five so far and having his minutes limited in three of those. Yet, despite those limitations, he's still managing 18-5-1 with 1.2 steals and 2.2 3s. He entered the season as a starter, so it's possible those averages could improve if the team gains confidence in his health and conditioning. The more IR spots your league has, the more attractive Hunter is, since he's probably going to miss games again eventually. But he's been easily rosterable when healthy, which he currently is. Jaden McDaniels, Timberwolves (34% rostered) Entering the 2023-24 season, McDaniels was heavily hyped by analysts as a likely breakout. It did not go as well as we'd hoped. Maybe we weren't wrong; we were just too early? McDaniels has multiple steals in five straight games and averaged 14-6-2 with 1.6 3s while playing 35 minutes per game during that stretch. There's no clear answer for what led to this improvement, but it's part of a steady trend through his first 15 games. Breaking McDaniels' season into three five-game chunks, he's played more minutes and put up better numbers in each segment. Ausar Thompson, Pistons (40% rostered) Thompson is still getting the game-to-game treatment, with the injury designation of ""return to competition reconditioning."" That combination seems to imply he'll make his season debut soon? I think? I hope? As I've mentioned in this space before, I'm very high on Thompson. He's insanely talented, and when a player, this good becomes available for a sub-.500 team, I assume that any semi-competent coach is going to figure out a way to find lots of minutes for him. He should be a great source of rebounds and defense, though his scoring and FT% could be problematic. Peyton Watson, Nuggets (29% rostered) Aaron Gordon (calf) is out for at least two more weeks, and Watson continues to chug along in his absence. I've hammered this point for weeks, nothing new to add – as long as Gordon is out, Watson is a starter in all leagues. He's averaging 14-4-1 with one steal, 1.3 blocks, and 1.7 3s since Gordon went down. Goga Bitadze, Magic (42% rostered) Wendell Carter (foot) just missed his tenth game with plantar fasciitis, an injury that is known to linger – especially in really tall, injury-prone NBA players. Plantar fasciitis is different from many injuries in that it doesn't have a set standard recovery timetable. The Magic are calling him game-to-game, and this isn't one of those obnoxious Hornets faux updates where they know he's really out for the next six years, and they're just refusing to tell us. Carter truly could return at any moment. But he also could be sidelined for a long time. And Bitadze excels when he's given court time. He's averaged 10-9-2 with 1.6 blocks while shooting 71% from the field during his 10 starts. Add him and start him for as long as Carter remains out. Donovan Clingan, Trail Blazers (63% rostered) Sorry in advance for engaging in the kind of analysis I tend to find annoying, but I'm pretty convinced by the ""Deandre Ayton just doesn't really like playing basketball that much"" arguments. Ayton is about to miss his fifth game with a finger injury. Clingan has averaged nearly a double-double with 3.5 blocks per game as a starter in Ayton's absence. Clingan will be tough to hold onto if Ayton returns to the court for an extended period of time between now and his eventual mid-winter banishment (either due to trade or tanking) – but that banishment is coming, and Clingan is absolutely worth rostering when Ayton isn't around. If I believed in Ayton's ""want to,"" then I'd view Clingan as more of a streamer. Finger injuries shouldn't last that long, and the trade deadline is still a long time away. But, since Ayton is one of the very few players whose motivation I doubt, I wonder if this absence might draw out longer than it would for someone a little more Westbrookian. Anthony Black, Magic (22% rostered) This blurb would have been a lot more enthusiastic had it been written before Thursday night's game. On Monday and Wednesday, Black exploded for 19-2-9 while playing 31 minutes. He also recorded four stocks and five 3s across those two games. By comparison, Thursday was muted, just 4-4-5 with one steal and no 3s in 22 minutes. This week demonstrates why I'm excited about Black – he's a good player with excellent flashes, an eye for assists, and a team willing to consider expanding his role. But it also shows why he's still not auto-start – his production is inconsistent, and his workload is unreliable. Any team with a deep bench and the ability to be patient should add Black. Otherwise, he's a borderline addition based on positional and categorical needs. Dalano Banton, Trail Blazers (14% rostered) Dalano Banton is good now, maybe? It's hard to know for sure since watching the Trail Blazers is illegal in most states (definitely including Connecticut, which is why ESPN refuses to acknowledge they exist). He's a weird player who has had quick moments in the past but has been limited by two main problems – inconsistency and fit. However, Banton seems to have found a role off the Portland bench, and the inconsistency problem has yet to rear its head. He's been downright metronomic recently, scoring between 10-13 points in seven of his last 10 games. In his last five, he's averaging 14-3-4 with 1.2 steals and 1.4 blocks. He's playing just 23.8 minutes during that stretch, so there's not much wiggle room before he loses fantasy viability, but that's not currently an issue. Robert Williams, Trail Blazers (35% rostered) Williams is currently healthy and playing roughly 25 minutes per game. That's enough for him to have fantasy relevance. I already used ""injury-plagued"" to describe De'Andre Hunter, so I don't have language strong enough to describe the injury risk involved in rostering Williams. But he's played at least 24 minutes in each of his last three games, and he's right back to the defensive production that's always driven his fantasy appeal. As long as Williams is playing, he should be on rosters. Malik Beasley, Pistons (55% rostered) Don't expect his current hot streak to last, but ride it while it does. Beasley is averaging a shocking 21-4-2 with 4.9 3s over his last eight games and playing at least 27 minutes in each. A lot of that production came while the Pistons were dealing with key injuries, but they were fully healthy both Monday and Thursday, and the minutes and efficiency persisted. He's still allergic to defense, and he's never sustained numbers like this, which is why he's listed so low despite this incredible run. So, be careful who you drop him for, and don't hang on too long, but by all means, get in while the getting is still good. Kyle Filipowski, Jazz (24% rostered) Filipowski left Thursday night's game early with an ankle injury, and we don't yet know the extent of the injury. He's not quite good enough to qualify for this article if he's about to miss a bunch of games. But if he is only going to miss a game (or none at all), then he's an add. His production is all over the place – points one night, assists the next – but he's getting more minutes, the average numbers are solid, and the overall trend continues to improve. Grant Williams, Hornets (29% rostered) Stephon Castle, Spurs (59% rostered) Kevin Huerter, Kings (33% rostered) Onyeka Okongwu, Hawks (58% rostered) Yves Missi, Pelicans (40% rostered) Jonathan Isaac, Magic (22% rostered) Deep league special Charles Bassey, Spurs (1% rostered) Bassey is streamable in all formats as long as Victor Wembanyama (knee) remains sidelined. The Spurs keep calling that injury a ""contusion,"" which is typically minor and implies a quick return, which is why Bassey didn't get mentioned as an all-leagues add, even though he's currently viable there, too. He's averaging 23.3 minutes since Wembanyama went out, blocking tons of shots and getting close-ish to points-rebounds double-doubles. Bassey barely plays when Wembanyama is healthy, so he might be a quick drop, but this level of productivity is hard to find in a deep league, even if short-lived."

Pittsburgh took their  contest  with ease, bagging  a  93-48 win over VMI. The Panthers have made a habit of sweeping their opponents off the court, having now won four  matchups by 19  points or more this season.  Pittsburgh got their  victory on the backs of several key players, but it was  Jaland Lowe out in front who  dropped  a triple-double on 11 points, ten  rebounds,  and ten  assists. Lowe had some trouble finding  his footing against West Virginia on Friday, so this was a step in the right direction. The team also got some help courtesy of  Cameron Corhen, who  made all 5 shots he took racking up 12 points plus six  rebounds.  Pittsburgh was working as a unit and  finished the game with 25  assists. That's the most  assists they've posted  since  the start of last season.  Meanwhile, LSU waltzed into their match  on Tuesday with three straight wins... but they left with four. They came out on top against the Buccaneers by a score of  77-68.  Multiple players turned in solid performances to lead LSU to victory, but perhaps none more so than   Vyctorius Miller, who  went 9 for 14 en route to 19 points plus two  steals. Corey Chest was another key player,  scoring eight points in addition to six  rebounds and two  steals.  Pittsburgh's win was  their 11th straight at home dating back to last season, which  pushed their record up to 5-0. As for LSU, their victory bumped their record up to 4-0.  Rebounding is likely to be a big factor in this contest:  Pittsburgh has crashing the boards this season,  having  averaged 42.2  rebounds per game. However, it's not like LSU struggles in that department as   they've been averaging 40.8. With both teams battling to corral missed shots, we'll see if one team can grab an edge.  Pittsburgh is a solid 6.5-point favorite against LSU, according to the latest college basketball odds. The line has drifted a bit towards the Panthers, as the game opened with the Panthers as a 4.5-point favorite. The over/under is 147.5  points.

CBSSports.com Headlines,"New Orleans Pelicans vs. Golden State Warriors: How to watch, schedule, live stream info, start time, TV channel",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/new-orleans-pelicans-vs-golden-state-warriors-how-to-watch-schedule-live-stream-info-start-time-tv-channel-29444957/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 20:30:33 +0000",How to watch Pelicans vs. Warriors basketball game,"Golden State Warriors @ New Orleans Pelicans Current Records: Golden State 11-3, New Orleans 4-12  The Warriors will be playing  the full four quarters  on Friday, but they're expected to have things wrapped up well before that. They will head out on the road to  challenge  the New Orleans Pelicans  at 7:30  p.m.  ET at Smoothie King Center. The Warriors are strutting in with some offensive muscle as they've averaged 119.6  points per game  this season.  The Warriors took a loss when they played away from home  on Monday, but their home fans gave them all the motivation they needed  on Wednesday. They were the clear victor by  a  120-97 margin over the Hawks. The  game was pretty much decided by the half, when the score had already reached  67-42.  The Warriors can attribute much of their success to   Andrew Wiggins, who  went 12 for 17 en route to 27 points plus seven  rebounds and two  blocks, and   Stephen Curry, who  went 7 for 10 en route to 23 points plus eight  assists and two  steals. What's more,  Curry also posted a 70%  field goal percentage, which is the highest he's  posted since back in April.  The Warriors were working as a unit and  finished the game with 36  assists (they're ranked first in  assists per game overall). That strong performance was nothing new for the team: they've now  racked up at least 27  assists in six consecutive  matches.  Meanwhile, the Pelicans' recent rough patch got a bit rougher  on Wednesday after their third straight  loss. They suffered a  painful 128-100 defeat at the hands of the Cavaliers. New Orleans was surely aware of their  disadvantage in the point spread, but the foreknowledge did nothing to prevent the result.  The Pelicans'  loss came about despite a quality game from  Antonio Reeves, who  went 14 for 25 en route to 34 points. Reeves is trending in the right direction considering he's  improved his point production for three straight games. Brandon Boston Jr., on the other hand, was considerably less helpful: he went 0-5  from beyond the arc.  Golden State pushed their record up to 11-3 with the  win, which was their fifth straight  at home. As for New Orleans, their defeat dropped their record down to 4-12. This contest  is shaping up to be a blowout:  The Warriors haven't had any problem running up the score this season,  having  averaged 119.6 points per game (they're ranked third in  scoring overall). It's a different story for the Pelicans, though, as  they've been averaging  only 103.5. The only thing between the Warriors and another offensive beatdown is the Pelicans. Will they be able to keep them contained?  The Warriors strolled past the Pelicans in their previous matchup  back in October by a score of  104-89. The rematch might be a little tougher for the Warriors since the  squad won't have the home-court advantage this time around. We'll see if the change in venue makes a difference.  Golden State is a big 10.5-point favorite against New Orleans, according to the latest NBA odds. The line has drifted a bit towards the Warriors, as the game opened with the Warriors as a 8-point favorite. The over/under is 223.5  points.

Apparently the fine folks over at The Economist looked across the pond at Canada's government-funded assisted suicide program and thought, ""Hey, we need that here,"" cuz check out this hot garbage:   Honestly, what's a financial magazine doing endorsing government-funded killing?  Here's The Economist: This newspaper believes in the liberal principle that people should have the right to choose the manner of their own death. So do two-thirds of Britons, who for decades have been in favour of assisted dying for those enduring unbearable suffering. And so do the citizens of many other democracies — 18 jurisdictions have passed laws in the past decade.Despite this, Westminster MPs look as if they could vote down a bill on November 29th that would introduce assisted dying into England and Wales. They would be squandering a rare chance to enrich people's fundamental liberties. Despite this, Westminster MPs look as if they could vote down a bill on November 29th that would introduce assisted dying into England and Wales. They would be squandering a rare chance to enrich people's fundamental liberties. Again...  Will England model their program off of the very dignified Canadian ""MAID"" program which offers this ""liberty"" to Canadian citizens? Because ...    Back to The Economist: Critics also raise concerns about the risk of coercion. But that is not credible in this case. In Ms Leadbeater's bill a person with around six months to live must make sustained requests approved by two doctors and a judge. The idea that an evil relative might go to great lengths to kill someone who will shortly be dead makes no sense ...Even if opponents of the bill are reassured by these arguments, some cannot shake the fear that Ms Leadbeater's law would be a slippery slope. If they mean that the criteria would sneakily be broadened to include the mentally ill or disabled without further legislation, then the facts are against them. In no case has an assisted-dying law restricted to the terminally ill expanded in this way. In Canada the scope widened, but that was because the courts enforced broad eligibility criteria derived from the country's existing Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Killing the terminally ill is already a grave evil. But the slippery slop is real. This is how it always starts: With terminally-ill patients.  Then it expands ...  Once you've decided that euthanizing people is acceptable, you've degraded the gift of life such that there's no limiting principle. The Economist is ignoring Canada, THE primary first-world example of socialized medicine mixing with assisted suicide and promoting people's ""liberty"" to end their lives. Sure, Britain may have to pass another law after this one, but once the cat's out of the bag, how do you put it back in?

Here's a transcript of the letter from Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) to Sec. of State Antony Blinken: Dear Secretary Blinken:As a Senior Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I write to you regarding reports of official post-election State Department therapy and listening sessions.' I am concerned that the Department is catering to federal employees who are personally devastated by the normal functioning of American democracy through the provision of government-funded mental health counseling because Kamala Harris was not elected President of the United States. As a Senior Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I write to you regarding reports of official post-election State Department therapy and listening sessions.' I am concerned that the Department is catering to federal employees who are personally devastated by the normal functioning of American democracy through the provision of government-funded mental health counseling because Kamala Harris was not elected President of the United States. Instead, on November 5, the American people resoundingly elected Donald J. Trump as the 47th President of the United States - a decisive repudiation of four years of failed Biden-Harris foreign policy. It is disturbing that ostensibly nonpartisan government officials would suffer a personal meltdown over the results of a free and fair election, something the United States champions around the world. It is unacceptable that the Department accommodates this behavior and subsidizes it with taxpayer dollars. I'm not sure what sound best describes serving someone their comeuppance, but there is a symphony of it happening in this letter. Furthermore, the mere fact that the Department is hosting these sessions raises significant questions about the willingness of its personnel to implement the lawful policy priorities that the American people elected President Trump to pursue and implement. The Trump Administration has a mandate for wholesale change in the foreign policy arena, and if foreign service officers cannot follow through on the American people's preferences, they should resign and seek a political appointment in the next Democrat administration.  Think about it: If you were the incoming boss of a company but the employees hated you so much that the old boss had to pay for therapy sessions to help them deal with the transition, what would you do with said employees? What about when you are talking about employees who must deal with foreign leaders and national security on the world stage, where optics, loyalty, and decorum are paramount?   The mental health of our foreign service personnel is important, but The Department has no obligation to indulge and promote the leftist political predilections of its employees and soothe their frayed nerves because of the good-faith votes of - and at the personal expense of - the American taxpayers. (The jury is out on whether that actually happens!)

Denise Kendrick was the latest to discover the wrath of the Tolerant Left™ when she decided to express her Christian beliefs in a way she thought was consistent with company policy. You see, the Fargo, North Dakota, Target employee saw her coworkers wearing rainbow flags and other religious symbols on their uniforms and decided that she'd show off her own faith. With this:  Denise wrote ""Trust in Jesus"" on her name tag and -- you guessed it -- was fired for her trouble. Kendrick told KVLY-TV that a manager approached her and informed her that she 'can't wear that name tag.'...Kendrick noted in a video on her YouTube channel, 'For several months, I had been wearing my red T-shirts that I ordered myself, my Christian red T-shirts, OK.

But the name tag apparently crossed a line with her manager. And when she said she wouldn't be held to a different standard than her Pride-promoting coworkers, she was fired. Denise believes a member of the rainbow mafia complained to management, leading to her termination. However, the story doesn't end there. Kendrick was vindicated earlier this week. On Tuesday, a spokesman said in a statement obtained by KVLY, 'Upon learning of the situation, we conducted a review and determined that the team member should not have been terminated. We apologized to her and offered to reinstate her immediately.''We are taking the appropriate steps to address the actions taken by the individual leader involved in this situation and are working with the store to ensure our policies are appropriately followed moving forward,' added the spokesman.

It's insulting when members of the working class, which the Democratic Party has lost entirely in our lifetimes, to insist the economy is doing great. A 12-pack of Bounty is $40. Rich folks don't feel that, poor folks already switched to Sparkle during the Covid lockdown. Another clue as to why the Left lost is that Seth's audience of trained seals thought the line about Sparkle was hilarious. After this short chuckle, it seems to sink in that he's criticizing them personally. I think telling them that the Nasdaq is gangbusters is further insulting. It's insulting, the biggest unforced error of the Biden administration, by far, was the border. To tell people that it's not a problem is insulting. For the working class to see incoming migrants getting welcome bags, debit cards, and motel rooms is probably insulting as well ...They handed out camo hats that said 'Harris-Walz' the Democrats were kind of charmed by that. Their party has gone quinoa and the rest of America is eating at Cracker Barrel ... it was an ironic use of something that millions of Americans put on their heads to start their day every day.

But because we live in clown world, the woke crowd has taken issue with the fact that the leading actors, Noa Cohen and Ido Tako, are both Israelis and look a little too white for the wokies.   Maybe Matthew 1 gives us a clue. Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers ... Boaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse, and Jesse the father of King David ... [King] Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon ... After the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel ... Matthan the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, and Mary was the mother of Jesus who is called the Messiah. Director D.J. Caruso told Entertainment Weekly back in October that the casting was purposeful, saying, When we started on this project, I immediately initiated a search for Mary. It was important to us that Mary, along with most of our primary cast, be selected from Israel to ensure authenticity. But authenticity just isn't good enough these days. We need to rewrite history. It's the #CurrentYear, so don't you know that Jesus was a 21st-century Palestinian who preached Marxist liberation theology??   Tell me you don't know anything about history, the Jews, or Christianity ... without telling me you don't know anything about Christianity. I'll let Tom here explain some of the history:  I'm sure all these keyboard warriors calling for a boycott over the Jewish casting of a Jewish character were the target audience that Netflix was trying to reach, but I guess we'll soon find out how the movie performs.

Talk about framing! Talk about insanity! The dude who wrote this for MSNBC, Danny Cevallos, is a lawyer himself. His whole piece talks about how ""hopeless"" this case was for the defense. The sub-headline tells you exactly where the heads of the MSNBC writers and editor were in this case: For all the political controversy surrounding Jose Ibarra, the outcome of this trial was never in doubt.  So ... the ""political controversy"" should have favored the perpetrator, but the evidence was just too great? Are you saying that the immigration status and protected class status of the killer should have been considered when dealing with RAPE AND MURDER? Riley's murder became a political rallying cry at this summer's Republican National Convention because Ibarra entered the country illegally in 2022. But for all the political controversy, the outcome of this trial was never in doubt. Because Trump comforted Laken's family, the trial should have been in doubt? What in the world??  I'm just going to have to get to the reactions on this one so that my blood doesn't boil out of my skin.

'And you can't have ""white people only"" come into my restaurant, and then you say, ""Well, no, we have a religious, spiritual nature to our restaurant, and when you get there, we serve you special food."" This seems quite different.' Olympus Spa was there appealing this decision from a lower court.  The right response to McKeown's inquiry is that it is correct to say that race and sex are inherent, immutable traits, which the law says cannot be discriminated against. That is the very definition of what makes them protected categories. If we agree that sex is an inherent, protected trait, then a traditional reading of all sexual protection laws suggest an appropriate separation of the two biological sexes in public and private venues, especially involving nudity. Instead of something logical like that with the thousands of case laws readily available, the lawyer goes down some weird trail about ""being welcome"" that the judge immediately shuts down as being the nonsense it is. Some reactions:     Will this case make it to the Supreme Court? Given the opinion Gorsuch delivered in R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC, I have my doubts.

I'll define ""genotoxic"" for you: Toxic (damaging) to DNA. Substances that are genotoxic may bind directly to DNA or act indirectly leading to DNA damage by affecting enzymes involved in DNA replication, thereby causing mutations which may or may not lead to cancer or birth defects. The study was carried out by researchers at the University of Western Australia, and was published in Addiction Biology. According to their findings, exposure to cannabis was associated with a range of cancers - breast, pancreatic, liver, thyroid, testicular and lymphoma - that also develop quickly and are more aggressive. In addition, links to birth defects were found, indicating that cannabis use could cause DNA mutations that pass on to children in utero. ""The link we've described between cannabis use and genotoxicity has far-reaching consequences,"" said Stuart Reece of the University of Western Australia, a co-author of the study. ""This new research shows how genetic damage from cannabis use can be passed down the generations."" Recreational marijuana use is legal in 24 states, 3 U.S. territories and the District of Columbia. While support for further legalization is gaining momentum, Reece added that he hopes the analysis ""reframes the discussion surrounding cannabis legalization from a personal choice to one that potentially involves multiple subsequent generations.""

This is the stuff they're hearing in the Illinois Supreme Court.   Yes, the convicted hate crime hoaxer, the man who has become known on both sides of the aisle as an actual joke, Jussie Smollett, is getting out of being punished for his crime. The 'Empire' actor was convicted in December 2021 of five felony counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly staging a hate crime against himself in 2019 and was sentenced to 150 days in county jail, plus 30 months of probation and $130,000 in restitution. This happened after the original charges against him were dropped in 2019. He was charged again after a special investigation and spent 6 days in jail before his sentence was suspended, pending appeal. In an opinion released on Thursday, the Illinois Supreme Court found that the special prosecutor's decision to retry Smollett violated his rights. Yeah, apparently the court is arguing that this was a case of double jeopardy and that he couldn't be tried again, even though he never stood trial for the original charges. Let this TV attorney explain the legalese:  'We are aware that this case has generated significant public interest and that many people were dissatisfied with the resolution of the original case and believed it to be unjust,' the court's opinion reads. 'Nevertheless, what would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the State was not bound to honor agreements upon which people have detrimentally relied.' Yeah. He totally didn't get special treatment because of his celebrity or because he is a gay black guy or because his hoax was designed to stoke hate against Trump supporters.

Gaetz's selection had put a new spotlight on prior allegations of sexual misconduct and other impropriety that had been investigated by the Department of Justice and the House Ethics Committee. A three-year-long DOJ investigation into Gaetz's misconduct ended up being a nothingburger, and we still have yet to hear anything substantial out of the House Ethics Committee, but Gaetz simply doesn't want to be a distraction, so he pulled his name from the AG selection.  Now we wait and see which based personality Trump will pick as his AG.

From WaPo: Magnus Tumi Gudmundsson, a geophysics professor at the University of Iceland who flew over the site of the eruption on Wednesday night, told The Washington Post in an email Thursday that the fissure opened up at the same location as earlier eruptions.Gudmundsson said that as of Thursday afternoon, the lava had reached the Blue Lagoon's parking lot. He added that barriers to protect Grindavik, the Blue Lagoon and the nearby Svartsengi Power Plant 'have been effective so far.' Gudmundsson said that as of Thursday afternoon, the lava had reached the Blue Lagoon's parking lot. He added that barriers to protect Grindavik, the Blue Lagoon and the nearby Svartsengi Power Plant 'have been effective so far.' Unlike previous eruptions, there weren't advanced warnings in the day ahead of the fissure reopening. Signs of an eruption only occured about 45 minutes ahead of time. 50 to 60 homes were evacuated and there have been no reports of casualties. It's unclear how long this period of increased activity will last, Gudmundsson said, but he noted that previous episodes suggested volcanic eruptions in the area could be followed by a period of around 100 to 150 years of no volcanic activity.

Logan Paul, brother of Jake Paul (who famously abused Mike Tyson in the ring on Netflix last week), is in some potentially deep trouble for allegedly buying, then promoting online, then selling a cryptocurrency called ""Elongate."" A crypto wallet holding the currency has, according to the BBC, been connected to Paul. From the BBC: The BBC has discovered that shortly before Paul tweeted about a particular crypto coin in 2021, an anonymous crypto wallet with close connections to his public wallet had traded in the coin.That anonymous wallet went on to make a $120,000 (£92,000) profit …The wallet was later paid funds from Maverick Club [Logan Paul's fan club] and held Elongate when Paul promoted it on 10 May 2021.Shortly after, it also traded in another Musk-related meme coin - after Paul had tweeted that it was headed 'to the moon'. In the crypto community, this means someone believes the price of the coin is about to shoot up.About an hour before Paul's tweet, the unknown wallet purchased almost $160,000 (£123,000) worth of the token. The tweet prompted an influx of buyers, spiking the price.Twelve hours later, the wallet sold most of its holding. The total profit made from this trade appears to be just over $120,000 (£92,000).

But then Paul did this:   For context, here's a photo of the actual Logan Paul:  So instead of taking an interview and clearing the air on this scandal, Paul attempted to troll the BBC to their face…  The BBC is currently working on a documentary called ""Logan Paul: Bad Influence?""

After sparking, overseeing, and enabling a years-long unprecedented migrant crisis - despite Kamala Harris's famously deep understanding of the issue as border czar - they're doing their best to let as many illegal immigrants into the country as possible before they're forced to pack up their stuff and make way for Trump. According to The New York Post, the outgoing administration is rushing to loosen a bunch of immigration policies, with New York City the center of this particular chapter of insanity.  One bright idea is the launch of an ICE Portal app next month that will allow up to 100,000 illegal immigrants to skip in-person check-ins with ICE altogether. With reports that the software is ""glitchy and unreliable.""  Oh, and unlike in-person appointments, the app doesn't even check for criminal history or warrants for arrest. Again, what could possibly go wrong?!   Other policies being pushed under the radar include allowing illegal immigrants to push back against electronic tracking. Because when you're letting in tens of thousands of criminals with outstanding warrants, the last thing a sane government could want is the ability to know where those criminals are. It's obvious at this point we don't have a sane government. Instead, we have an insane government motivated by, as former acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan said, putting up ""as many roadblocks and obstacles and throw[ing] as many grenades as they can on their way out.""

Not only are they spending their time imposing sanctions on Israelis, funding Palestinian terrorists and trying their best to spark all-out-war in Europe, they're now focusing on the big bad wolf of Silicon Valley: Google. On Wednesday, Biden's Justice Department filed a 23-page manifesto asking a judge to rip apart Google's empire, including the sale of Google's Chrome web browser (you know, the one you're probably using to read this article) and to restrict Android phones from favoring Google's own search engine.  According to the DOJ, for the past decade, Google has been squashing competition. This follows a ruling in August by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that Google is a monopolist.  This is the first time in over two decades that a tech company of this size has been declared a monopoly. Ironically, the breakup of Microsoft in 2001 after years of court battles allowed for small startups like Google to seize control of the tech landscape in the aftermath.  Not only does the Justice Department want to stop Google from cutting multi-billion-dollar deals that make its search engine the default on every device - saving us the hassle of having to ask that idiot, Jeeves - they also want Google to open up its search data to rivals. (Because nothing builds competition like handing your competitors one of your biggest successes on a silver platter.) Regulators also want to ban Google from favoring its own products, like YouTube or its new AI platform, Gemini. Because in Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's America, self-promotion is just … not allowed. Right?  Google's legal team, led by Kent Walker, called the proposals ""radical"" and claimed they'd harm Americans and our global tech dominance. According to Walker, the DOJ's proposal would: Endanger the security and privacy of millions of Americans, and undermine the quality of products people love, by forcing the sale of Chrome and potentially Android. Require disclosure to unknown foreign and domestic companies of not just Google's innovations and results, but even more troublingly, Americans' personal search queries. Chill our investment in artificial intelligence, perhaps the most important innovation of our time, where Google plays a leading role. Hurt innovative services, like Mozilla's Firefox, whose businesses depend on charging Google for Search placement. Deliberately hobble people's ability to access Google Search. Mandate government micromanagement of Google Search and other technologies by appointing a ""Technical Committee"" with enormous power over your online experience. ""DOJ's approach would result in unprecedented government overreach that would harm American consumers, developers, and small businesses — and jeopardize America's global economic and technological leadership at precisely the moment it's needed most,"" Walker concluded.

Look at that punk's smile.  This isn't his first arrest and he knows he will be back out again before long.

I am happy she isn't hurt. However, I hope this helps open her eyes to just exactly what her and her boss's policies and actions are doing to people. They say that a conservative is someone who's been mugged by reality. We'll see if that happens here. The suspect is a migrant and police were able to track him down ... the suspect was using drugs on the street ... police believe he is part of Tren de Aragua ... he also has six prior arrests all from this year on similar crimes and he is believed to have arrived in the US in February of 2023. The man has been in the country for a year and he's been arrested in NYC SIX TIMES in 2024 for the same crimes over and over again. I don't know if we should criticize Bragg's soft-on-crime policy (which applies to everyone except Donald Trump and white Marines who try to save lives) or if we should criticize New York's sanctuary city policy.

Dude was going to blow up the New York Stock Exchange. Luckily, his plan was foiled by the FBI. Even though oftentimes I bash on them, they did their job here, and if they hadn't, who knows what would've happened. A Florida man [Muslim jihadi] was arrested Wednesday and charged with a plot to ‘reboot' the U.S. government by planting a bomb at the New York Stock Exchange this week and detonating it with a remote-controlled device, according to the FBI …  The FBI began investigating Yener in February based on a tip that he was storing ‘bombmaking schematics' in a storage unit. They found bomb-making sketches, many watches with timers, electronic circuit boards and other electronics that could be used for building explosive devices, according to the FBI. He had also searched online for things related to bomb-making since 2017, according to the FBI …In the last month, he had rewired two-way radios so that they could work as remote triggers for an explosive device and planned to wear a disguise when planting the explosives, according to court documents. In the last month, he had rewired two-way radios so that they could work as remote triggers for an explosive device and planned to wear a disguise when planting the explosives, according to court documents. Believe it or not, this dude had a YouTube channel where he posted advice on how to build explosives. (Some free advice for you terrorists out there: Don't ever have a YouTube channel where you teach people how to build explosives.) Yener said he felt ""like Bin Laden."" From CBS 12: Yener planned to wear a disguise when he planted the explosive device outside the building and recorded a message to be delivered to the press about why he did it. The DOJ says Yener anticipated the impact of the explosion would be 'like a small nuke went off' and ""'[a]nything outside"" the building ""will be wiped out'"" and ""anything inside would be killed.'"" The undercover FBI employee gave a microphone to Yener for him to record his 'demand statement' that he intended to send to NBC News the day of or the day after the planned attack, where he said 'I feel like Bin Laden', according to documents. Another interesting tidbit from the AP because we live in a fascinating world with interesting mashups: He was also part of a small group that tried to join the far-right anti-government group the ‘Boogaloo Bois' and extremist group the Proud Boys but was denied membership because he said he wanted ‘to pursue martyrdom,' according to court documents.

	Jones, the No. 6 overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, was benched by the Giants earlier this week.","The New York Giants made the decision to bench starting quarterback Daniel Jones earlier this week amid a brutal year where the offense has struggled to find any sort of consistent rhythm. Now, in a shocking turn of events, the team announced on Friday afternoon that the sixth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft asked for and was granted his immediate release. In a statement, which you can read in its entirely below, Giants president John Mara praised Jones for his handling of his benching, and made clear that parting ways was a mutual decision. Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him. We mutually agreed that would be the best for him and for the team.  Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way. His handling of this situation yesterday exemplifies just that. We are all disappointed in how things have worked out.  We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him. We wish him nothing but the best in the future. Jones has had a tumultuous tenure in New York, as the decision to draft him that high was largely based on his perceived upside. While he’s certainly flashed the ability to be an accurate passer and a threat with his legs — so much so that the team gave him a $160 million extension in 2023 that was cited as a reason why they could not bring back Saquon Barkley in free agency this offseason — he’s never been able to become the face of the franchise the team envisioned. The Giants sit at 2-8 on the season, and are playing host to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday afternoon. The team has already announced that Tommy DeVito will start under center. To add some intrigue to this, the Giants face the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving this year. Dallas has had its own QB struggles this season as Dak Prescott is out for the year with the injury, and if they wanted, it would make sense to bring in Jones and try to get him up to speed ahead of Thursday."

	Miller made one of the best defensive plays you will ever see to stop an alley-oop by the Pistons.","The Charlotte Hornets and the Detroit Pistons squared off on Thursday night in a battle of two up-and-coming teams that hope to take a step forward in the Eastern Conference this season. While neither of them are expected to compete for a championship or anything, both are built around promising young players and hope that better days are on the horizon. One of the brightest young stars in Thursday’s game was Brandon Miller, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who flashed as a rookie and has built on that in a big way during his second year in the league. Unfortunately for the Pistons, that meant finding out that Miller is a freak of nature, as evidenced by him making one of the best defensive plays you will ever see when he single-handedly blew up an attempted alley-oop by picking a Wendell Moore lob out of mid-air.  A post shared by NBA (@nba)  If Miller became horizontal during this, it’d look an awful lot like Odell Beckham Jr.’s famous one-handed catch from when he played for the Giants. Anyway, the Hornets won in overtime, 123-121, with Miller leading the way, as the former Alabama standout went for 38 points, seven rebounds, four assists, four steals, and a block in 42 minutes of work."

	Gobert got a 3-second call as he pouted over not getting the ball late in a tie game, and Anthony Edwards was not happy.","The Minnesota Timberwolves were one of the best teams and stories of the 2023-24 season, as Anthony Edwards made the leap into superstardom, Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert figured out how to play off of each other around him, and they made a run to the Western Conference Finals.  The vibes in Minnesota were, as they say, immaculate, but then a week before training camp they traded Towns to New York for Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo in a trade that has seen both the Knicks and Wolves struggling to build chemistry early in the season. Both teams are still hovering around .500, but the Knicks can get away with that in the East and still have a good look at a top-4 seed. In the West things are very different, as the Wolves came into Thursday’s game in Toronto with a tenuous hold on sixth at 8-6, needing a win to avoid dropping to a tie for 10th early this season.  In theory, the 3-12 Raptors should’ve been a good spot to get a win for the Wolves, but Minnesota found themselves in a dogfight with Toronto (on their incredible alternate court) late in the fourth quarter. With the game tied at 95-95 and five minutes to play, the Wolves chemistry issues became apparent when Randle waved off Gobert who had deep post position under the hoop, and the 4-time DPOY responded by walking to the other side of the lane to get a 3-second violation.   A post shared by LeagueAlerts Inc. (@leaguealerts)  While Gobert’s frustration is understandable, as he had two feet in the restricted area with a seal on a smaller defender and didn’t get the ball, you also can’t purposefully get a turnover in a tie game in the fourth quarter. That was what Anthony Edwards was thinking, as he got on Gobert as they came down the floor, letting him know that’s not an acceptable reaction to not getting the ball. That turnover proved to be important as the Wolves saw the Raptors pull away late for a 110-105 win, dropping Minnesota to 8-7 and a tie for 10th in the West with Dallas and Sacramento."

	To celebrate Hubie Brown calling it a career, we looked back on how old he was during major events that happened in his lifetime.","Basketball fans are going to see broadcasts get a little worse sooner rather than later. That’s because Hubie Brown, the legendary former coach who has turned into a stalwart on ESPN’s coverage of the league, will only call one more game before he retires at 91 years old. “We are going to give Hubie one last shot on a game,” ESPN president Burke Magnus told Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated. “He deserves that. We think the world of him. I think it is absolutely remarkable the level in which he still calls games at age 90-plus. I don’t mean to be purposely mysterious here but we are going to honor Hubie during the regular season at some point to be determined and send him off in style.” That he is still capable of working at 91 is remarkable, but Brown is still sharp as a tack and as good as it gets calling basketball games, and while no one has deserved retirement more, it’s always a tough day when someone as highly-regarded as him calls it a career. There is, still, no one better at seeing something, pointing it out, and explaining why it’s a big deal than Brown, and he has terrific chemistry with his broadcast partners. We’re all going to miss Hubie, and to celebrate the end of his time in the booth, we wanted to celebrate him by having some fun and looking at everything he’s seen over his extraordinary life. You see, Hubie was born on Sept. 25, 1933, which means he has been around for, quite literally, every single game that the NBA has played — the league was founded in June of 1946, when he was 12 years old. That got us wondering: How old was he during some of the biggest moments in world, American, and NBA history over the last century or so? Let’s dive in. Start of WWII: 5 years old (Sept. 1, 1939)
End of WWII: 11 years old (Sept. 2, 1945)
The first NBA game: 13 years old (Nov. 1, 1946)
Jackie Robinson breaks baseball’s color barrier: 13 years old (April 15, 1947)
The first NBA Draft: 16 years old (April 25, 1950) Bill Russell plays in his first NBA game: 23 years old (Dec. 22, 1956)
Wilt Chamberlain plays in his first NBA game: 26 years old (Oct. 24, 1959)
John F. Kennedy Assassination: 30 years old (Nov. 22, 1963)
Super Bowl I: 34 years old (Jan. 15, 1967)
First moon landing: 36 years old (July 20, 1969) End of the Vietnam War: 41 years old (April 30, 1975)
Hubie Brown’s first game as an NBA head coach with the Atlanta Hawks: 42 years old (Oct. 21, 1976)
The first time Larry Bird and Magic Johnson played in the NBA Finals: 51 years old (May 27, 1984)
First NBA Draft Lottery: 52 years old (May 12, 1985)
End of the Cold War: 56 years old (Dec. 3, 1989)
Michael Jordan retires for the first time: 60 years old (Oct. 26, 1993) 9/11: 67 years old (Sept. 11, 2001)

	ESPN content president Burke Magnus explained that the network's biggest star ending up on its newest property is a bit tricky.","ESPN has about a year to figure out how it’s going to handle Inside the NBA. As part of Warner Bros. Discovery’s deal to remain in the NBA’s media ecosystem, it was announced that Turner will continue to produce Inside, but license it out to ESPN, which solves the network’s longstanding issues trying to put together a pregame, halftime, and postgame NBA show that viewers enjoy. An unsurprising question that popped up after this was whether Stephen A. Smith — who is in the middle of some high-profile contract negotiations with ESPN — would find a way onto the show. Smith is the guy ESPN has built its NBA coverage around, and while that has come under plenty of criticism, he’s famously close with the Inside crew and has appeared on it in the past. But apparently, as of now, the network doesn’t have any intetion of putting Stephen A. on their newest property. “We have no plans to do that,” ESPN content president Burke Magnus told Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated. “And that’s because, frankly, the construct of the deal really doesn’t — that’s not how it was conceived. What is conceived is that Turner, as they have always done with this show, with this cast, with the people involved behind the scenes, are going to continue to do what they’ve always done. And we’re going to distribute it on the ESPN platform. Frankly, that’s exactly what we want. We don’t want to change it. We don’t want to interject new talent into it. We don’t want to really do anything to it.” It is worth mentioning that the scuttlebutt around Smith’s contract negotiations revolves around him wanting to do more NFL stuff for ESPN, but considering how big Inside is and his relationship with the guys, it is fair to wonder if he’d want to have any sort of presence on the show as part of a new deal (if, of course, he comes to terms with the network on one). For now, the complexities of the deal with Turner gives ESPN a way to say they have no plans of putting him on Inside in any capacity, but we’ll certainly be waiting to see if that changes as Smith and ESPN sit down at the negotiating table.

	Come get these winners.","In many circles, Week 11 has been described as the best slate of games so far when it comes to the 2024 NFL season, and it is hard to argue. There was entertaining action in every window other than Monday night and, on a week-to-week basis, that is not always the case. In this space, we also found success with a third winning week in the last four. Granted, it came with a hilarious investment in a team that lost by approximately 100, but a loss counts the same by a half-point or 30 points, right? Before we get to the Week 12 schedule and five picks against the spread, let’s take a look at the (unfortunately negative) season-long progress. Come get these winners. We struck with our principles last Thursday to success, and we’re doing it again here. It is unsightly to bet on Cleveland right now, and I won’t argue that. The Browns are 2-8 and having a season from hell. With that said, the market is too high on the Steelers in this spot. Pittsburgh continues to be unreal in an underdog role under Mike Tomlin, but the Steelers are 33-41-3 (44.6%) as a road favorite under his watch. Do I think the games from 2008 impact this week? I do not, but I can’t get this to more than a field goal on a short week in Cleveland. Let’s go Browns. This is a space that prides itself on taking the stands that few others will take. This is another example. The Lions are dominating everyone. We found that out the hard way last week. But this is really a 7.5-point number on the road? Detroit’s ATS record (8-2) is stellar but things have gone too far. Or maybe we’ll lose this bet and swear off fading the Lions for a while. Either way, I like the home dog here. Our Wong teaser of the week is here. Tennessee’s defense has been spunky this season, but the Titans still have Will Levis and a rudderless offense that gives us hope in the Texans at home with the move through key numbers. On the other side, I’ve actually been a touch low on the 49ers compared to the market this season and, while that has been the right stance on the whole, this is a principle play to take it up to 8.5. Remember when the 12th Man meant something? Well, the Seahawks are 2-4 at home this season, and the word is out on that. While I am not suggesting that home-field advantage is the reason for this play, I like Seattle to keep it going after a strong performance in an upset over San Francisco a week ago. Arizona is off a bye and on a four-game winning streak but, no matter what I do, I can’t get this to a pick’em, much less than +1 available at BetMGM right now. I don’t give out many road favorites, but I tend to make exceptions for when the Chargers are the home team. Granted, a lot has changed in Los Angeles, with Jim Harbaugh immediately turning the Chargers into a very competent and effective outfit. However, the Chargers still might have the least significant home-field advantage in the NFL, and Baltimore is at least slightly undervalued here coming off a loss to Pittsburgh."

	Charles Barkley wasn't gonna let the night go by without making a joke about their upcoming move to ESPN next fall.","Over the weekend, some exciting news broke regarding the future of Inside the NBA, as ESPN is adding the beloved studio show as part of a new licensing agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery. The show will continue to be produced independently by TNT Sports from their Atlanta studio, with Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, Shaquille O’Neal, and Charles Barkley remaining employees of WBD — well, so long as they get Shaq’s contract done — but they’ll be part of ESPN and ABC’s coverage of the Playoffs, Finals, and major regular season games. That was stunning news to many fans, largely because ESPN has been trying to figure out how to create a competitor to Inside for decades to no avail, and the fellas have never been afraid of making fun of ESPN — particularly Barkley. Chuck has taken ESPN and their analysts to tasks a number of times over the years, and while I doubt that stops in total, he knows times are changing soon for he and the rest of the fellas. On Tuesday night, after the Spurs beat the Thunder in the late game on TNT, Chuck couldn’t help but crack a joke to Kenny Smith that they’ve gotta “go back to kissing ass” ahead of their move to ESPN next fall.  No one has been more outspoken over the last six months about the contract negotiations with the NBA than Barkley, sometimes to the chagrin of his colleagues. He’s been extremely vocal about his frustrations with TNT not keeping NBA rights and has noted his biggest concern is trying to figure out how to keep everyone at TNT employed. That mission seems to have been accomplished with this latest news of the show being licensed to ESPN, and he showed still going to be Chuck and poke fun at the new arrangement."

	Another case of Vince Staples, being Vince Staples.","Vince Staples isn’t afraid to voice his opinion regarding anything and anyone. No one is exempt from the “Little Homies” rapper’s blunt takes—not fellow musicians, fans, or content creators. Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is the latest person to feel his humorous wrath. Today (November 19), Vince Staples and Jayson Tatum came face-to-face in a new commercial for the Jordan brand (viewable here). Instead of using his beloved lyricism on full display, Vince channelled his words for another reason. As highlights of Tatum’s Championship season took over the screen, Vince gave Tatum a piece of his mind. “What type of dude is Jayson Tatum,” asked Vince. “The type of dude who’d crush a team and then say some cold sh*t like, ‘We just played our game and the rest took care of itself.'” As Vince pointed out, Tatum is a many of few words but when he does speak out against his opponents it cuts deeps. However, Tatum manages to keep a cool head or so Vince argued, saying: “The type that have a whole city and internet, booing him. And he’s just smiling.” Before the clip ends, Vince has one more grievance to air as a long-suffering Los Angeles Clippers fan. “That sh*t really message me up, man,” he said.  Unfazed by it all, Tatum laughs off Vince’s monologue. In Tatum’s eyes, it doesn’t matter who hates him because his partner, singer Ella Mai and their child provides more than enough love to make up for it."

	After a loss dropped the Sixers to 2-11 on the year, the team held a players-only meeting where Maxey voiced a gripe about Embiid.","The Philadelphia 76ers have been the biggest disappointment in the NBA to start the 2024-25 season. While there have been injuries to Joel Embiid, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey that have prevented them from taking the court as a trio, Philadelphia has gotten off to a 2-11 start this year, which is tied with the openly tanking Washington Wizards for the worst record in the NBA. For a team that entered this season with championship aspirations, it’s pretty shocking to see just how bad Philly has been. And following a 106-89 loss to the Miami Heat on Monday night where the team blew a 19-point lead, Kyle Lowry called for a players-only meeting, according to Shams Charania of ESPN. And per Charania, the meeting included Maxey confronting Embiid with a message that the former NBA MVP “accepted.” Via ESPN: In the meeting, Maxey challenged Embiid to be on time to team activities, calling out the former league MVP about being late “for everything” and how it impacts the locker room, from other players to the coaching staff, sources briefed on the meeting told ESPN. Maxey and Embiid have a close friendship and have a history of holding each other accountable, according to those around the team. Embiid was listed as doubtful to play against the Heat with an illness, but eventually took the floor and struggled, going for 11 points, eight rebounds, and five assists in 31 minutes of work on 5-for-11 shooting from the field. Maxey, meanwhile, was unable to play, as he’s working his way back from a hamstring strain he suffered earlier this season. Charania also noted that Sixers players addressed head coach Nick Nurse, saying that “they want to be coached harder, and coaches in turn said they want players to practice with purpose and attention to detail.”"

	Powerhouse Hobbs has a list of aspirations after spending seven months out with a knee injury.","Powerhouse Hobbs wasn’t sure how fans were going to receive his return. Recency bias is a real thing in the wrestling industry, and any extended absence comes with the reality that you’re out of sight and out of mind.  When he walked out of the tunnel to the roar of the live audience as Ricochet’s surprise partner just two weeks ago, any anxiety over what the reaction would look like evaporated. For Hobbs, it was like he’d never left.  “It was one of those things where it let me know how special this business is, how special the fans are,” Hobbs tells Uproxx Sports. “When it comes down to it, we do it for them. We do it for their entertainment. We do it for their reactions. We do it because we love it. We all love to go out and perform in front of them. But then when they go ahead and give you that love back, man, it makes you want to go even harder.” As smooth as he looked in his return to the ring, the prior seven months were anything but easy.  He ruptured his patella tendon in a main event match, going from the high of being prominently featured on television on Wednesday night to having surgery the following Monday. The next day, he flew across the country, and just a week later was back in the gym determined to return stronger.  “I probably had a few days to be in my feelings and soak everything in,” Hobbs says. “But my main objective was to come back better than when I left. This recovery, I would get up at five, eat, in the gym by six on one leg for two hours, come home, eat, then off to PT for three hours a day, Monday through Saturday.” There were moments Hobbs says he felt helpless. He couldn’t bend his knee at all. He remembers the emotions of asking his three-year-old daughter to help take his sock off, asking his son to help him stand, or making sure he had something to hold onto so he didn’t fall in the shower.  The experience, Hobbs says, humbled him. Small accomplishments compounded. A strong support system that included conversations with wrestling legends like Sting, Mark Henry, and Billy Gunn helped him prepare for the ups, downs, and evolving mindset in how he’d navigate his return.  In his time away, Hobbs focused on the things he could control and put extra effort on how he could elevate other areas of his game.  “I got a lot of promos just sitting on the couch watching wrestling. I was very angry, not being able to do what I want to do,” Hobbs says.  Practicing patience is something Hobbs has had to learn over his four years in AEW, and especially now in what’s essentially a fresh start. You can’t manufacture many of the special moments in wrestling — they’re going to happen organically, like the infamous Meat chants last year. “You’re going to hear the people tell you what they want,” Hobbs says, “so it’s on you to capitalize on it.” Hearing the crowd react to his return, and feeding off their energy over the past few weeks, should give him confidence that he’ll be able to be successful in his career refresh. He created a list of aspirations during his time away, including another singles championship reign.  There’s no order to how he goes about checking off his accomplishments, but admits the primary focus is a “longer, stronger reign.” His path to wearing championship gold again comes with confidence, believing in himself, and turning the volume up on his character.  Before his injury, Hobbs says there were discussions about how he could start bringing who he is in real life to his character. Now that he’s had time to sit and stew on the future, he’s ready to show the world who he is.  “I’m going to start bringing my life into my character, the things that I hate, the things that I love. I’m just gonna show everyone how much more intense I can be, how destructive I can be, how I don’t give a shit at times who’s in my way,” Hobbs says. “In the end, this business, there only can be one. It’s going to come to a point where I’m going to show everybody that it’s all about me. They’re either going to be with me or be against me. It doesn’t matter. They boo me, I’m just going to start tearing everything up in front of them.  “And I think that’s what wrestling is missing a little bit. That one guy who makes people afraid, but they want to see him kick someone’s ass. I feel that it’s time to bring it out.”"

	Jake Paul's boxing fit in his match against Mike Tyson was one of the most expensive in boxing history. Here is what he wore.","Over the weekend, social media sensation turned legit boxer Jake Paul faced off against the mighty (if aged) Mike Tyson, attracting the eyes of 60 million viewers for what was undoubtedly the fight of the year. The two fighters, aged 27 and 58 respectively, lasted the entire eight rounds, with Paul ultimately besting Iron Mike, crushing the hearts of pretty much everybody over the age of 30. But we’re not here to talk about the fight, we’re here to talk about Jake Paul’s fit, which Paul revealed on the “Talk Tuah” podcast was worth over $1 million. “This outfit that I’ve made for the fight is the most expensive fight outfit in the history of boxing,” said Paul. The fit was a custom piece designed by Dominic Ciambrone’s Surgeon Studios and featured metallic silver shorts with diamond tennis chains, and a graphic of Mr. Monopoly holding a money bag. The full outfit was completed with a jewel-encrusted gray jacket prominently featuring the logo of Paul’s new body care line W. It’s flashy, brash, and eye-catching, a perfect reflection of Paul’s whole vibe. Love him or hate him, you can’t deny that this fight helped to solidify Paul’s status as a pop culture icon of the 2020s, and despite Tyson’s advanced age, being able to go toe to toe with the GOAT and come out on top is no easy feat. This is also a big win for Ciambrone, who we’ve been keeping a close eye on since the days he was simply referred to as the Shoe Surgeon. Check out the fit in action below."

	Tyrese Haliburton took over the NBA Cup last year. Which young, up-and-coming player is most likely to do that this year?","Tyrese Haliburton entered last season in an interesting spot. Yes, everyone knew he was a really good, really talented basketball player — he even made it onto the 2023 All-Star team. And yet, Haliburton was mostly a guy who did some cool things on a not great Indiana Pacers team, which came on the heels of him doing some cool things as a rookie and a second-year player on a not great Sacramento Kings team. And then, last season happened. More specifically, the inaugural NBA Cup (known at the time as the In-Season Tournament) happened, and Haliburton was the driving force behind an upstart Pacers team that took it to everyone and made the championship game, where they fell to the Los Angeles Lakers. It was the exact sort of springboard to stardom that a cup competition should provide, as a young, up-and-coming team led by a young, up-and-coming star went on a run and nearly won the whole thing. Haliburton averaged 26.7 points, 13.3 assists, and 4.9 rebounds in seven tournament games, and while he cooled off a bit as the year went on due to lingering injury issues, he was still able to use his NBA Cup performance as a springboard to an All-NBA Third Team nod and an appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals. Now, with this season’s NBA Cup underway, it’s worth wondering which young star is going to use this edition of the tournament as a way to assert themselves as a superstar, and today, we wanted to look at some of the frontrunners to do just that on teams that have already gotten off to good starts in Cup play. The Rockets have been one of the best up-and-coming teams in the league so far this season, and while you can toss a few guys in as their answer (Jalen Green would be a good fit here, too), we’ll go with Sengun, who was great last year but was sidelined with an injury during their big run later in the calendar. Anyone who watches Houston knows that Sengun is good, but ever since they traded James Harden, the Rockets haven’t gotten a ton of attention. The NBA Cup is a chance to change that — they steamrolled the Clippers in their Group A opener last week — and if they can win their game in Minnesota next week, they’re going to be the overwhelming favorites to move out of their group. Add in that Houston has a net rating of +12.98 when Sengun is on the floor this season and while depth is one of their biggest strengths, we’re willing to bet that he’s the guy who will carry them to Cup wins if they come. Atlanta beating the Celtics in their NBA Cup opener was a shock, and they followed it up with a win over Washington in their second game. The craziest thing about the game against Boston: Trae Young didn’t play, as Daniels was a two-way menace (28 points, seven assists, six steals) and Johnson stuffed the stat sheet (18 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists, three steals, a block). Young is, obviously, the face in Atlanta, but on the heels of the Dejounte Murray trade, there’s space for someone to blossom into his star running mate. Daniels’ ability to just ruin opposing backcourts and Johnson’s ability to do anything Atlanta needs on a given night both fit well alongside him, and they’ll both have to be great if the Hawks go on a run. Things have been completely dire in Detroit for a while now, and as a result, Cunningham hasn’t lived up to his billing as a No. 1 overall pick. But things are starting to change — Detroit is 2-0 in Cup play, with Cunningham going for 21 points, nine assists, seven rebounds, and two blocks against the Heat before putting up a 21-point, 10-rebounds, 10-assist triple-double with five steals and a block against the Wizards. He has to cut down on his turnovers, but he’s spearheading the Pistons as they try to take a big step forward under JB Bickerstaff. So far, so good, and if Detroit goes on an improbable NBA Cup run, it’ll be because Cunningham took a big leap towards becoming the face of the franchise the Pistons have craved for years. The most likely option to go on a Haliburton-esque run. Orlando is 2-0 with wins over Charlotte and Philly, even though Paolo Banchero is out with a torn oblique. The ball has been in Wagner’s hands a lot as a result, and the decision has paid off in a big way. He’s starting to find his shot after he couldn’t hit anything last season, while he looks really comfortable as a scorer and a facilitator. The Magic being good without Banchero is only possible because of Wagner, and a trip to the knockout rounds of the NBA Cup is within reach — their game in New York on Dec. 3 looms large, and we cannot wait to see what Wagner does under the bright lights of Madison Square Garden. You might have heard this by now: The Cavs are the best team in basketball this year at 15-0, and they won their only NBA Cup game so far against Charlotte. All eyes are on Tuesday night’s trip to Boston to take on the defending champs, which is the exact sort of high-profile stage Cleveland could use to emphatically say they’re championship and NBA Cup contenders. A big reason for the success? Mobley, as the decision to bring Kenny Atkinson on board as head coach has led to him looking more comfortable on offense and his usual brilliant self on defense. He has to continue to do that if the Cavs are going to be championship contenders, and the NBA Cup is a great place for him to show that he’s taken a step forward in his fourth season. If you want, you can also make a case for Darius Garland here, who has been nothing short of spectacular this season and is showing why he’s one of the best young guards in the league. However, Garland has been an All-Star and Donovan Mitchell is a known commodity, so we’ll go with the young big man as the Cav most likely to turn heads.  The Thunder are in a tricky spot due to the injuries suffered by Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein, so it’s possible they are just not big enough to go on an NBA Cup run. If they can, though, our hunch is it’s because of Williams stepping up and being the perfect running mate alongside Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He keeps getting better and better the more experience he gets under his belt, and so far this season, Williams has done that again, as he’s putting up career-best marks in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks per game. He won’t unseat Shai as the man in Oklahoma City any time soon, but the Thunder are the exact sort of team that can use the NBA Cup as a chance to announce their arrival to the rest of the league. Williams can do the same."

We pick up the HBCU Homecoming series with only a day left before Director of Bands Chancellor Mills gets to prove himself in his first year in the position with the help of more than 100 band members and his staff. “It’s all in the planning, first and foremost,” Mills said in preparation for the event. “We don’t want to throw anything together and just put it out there; it’s huge this year.” As Mills said, the planning is critical, as the pressure of the occasion couldn’t be any higher, with current students and alumni all expecting a great show. “This performance is just going to signify where this program is,” said Mills. “It’s going to dictate how we’re going to move for the next 3-5 years. It’s significant in terms of what we want to give back to our community.” Fortunately, the hard work pays off as the band comes out at halftime to give the crowd their best with renditions of hip-hop classics produced by Just Blaze, including Joe Budden’s “Pump it Up” and “What We Do” by Freeway, who appeared to perform the song in-person. “I’ve had my songs played at a million sporting events,” Blaze said of the performance. “This is just kind of a great add-on to that part of the legacy. It sounded amazing.” As Blaze says in the episode, the party was far from over after the performance. Check out additional footage from the band’s night performance and more to see how the performance was received."

	Apparently, Shaq is a little upset with things, although he would like to remain on the show.","Basketball fans got some pretty monumental news over the weekend. As part of the agreement that will keep Warner Bros. Discovery as one of the league’s broadcast partners during its upcoming media right deal, Turner Sports will continue to produce “Inside the NBA” but license the show out to ESPN, which will air it going forward. The deal officially got announced on Monday, and there are some pretty big questions that continue to hang over the agreement that ESPN and Turner will have to get sorted out between now and the start of the 2025-26 season. As it turns out, there’s one especially big one that hangs over the deal, as Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated reported that Shaquille O’Neal is out of a contract on July 1, 2025. And apparently, there’s a bit of tension on the Hall of Fame inductee’s side of things right now. While sources say Shaq wants to remain on the show, he’s frustrated that there has been congratulations and press releases hyping that Inside the NBA is remaining the same while he is currently not under contract to be with the company next season. As Traina noted, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley all do other things for Turner, so their deals are different from Shaq’s, who exclusively does NBA work for the network. It goes without saying, but Inside without Shaq would not feel the same, although we’re optimistic that Draymond Green joining the show whenever his playing career ends would be a good fill-in for him. Still, whether it’s agreeing to another deal with Turner or working something out with ESPN, here’s hoping that Shaq is at the desk with the rest of the guys when Inside airs on the Worldwide Leader for the first time."

	There's no word on whether the league will have a high-profile halftime show for its other Christmas game.","The NFL has started to have a larger and larger presence on Christmas Day over the years. This season, the league will put a pair of marquee games on Dec. 25, as the Kansas City Chiefs will travel to Pittsburgh to Take on the Steelers in the 1 p.m window, while the Houston Texans will play host to the Baltimore Ravens at 4:30 p.m. ET. Late on Sunday night, the NFL decided to announce that it has something special up its sleeve for the late afternoon game, as it was revealed that Beyonce will perform at halftime in her hometown.  A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)  There’s no word on whether the league has a similarly huge name lined up for the early game, but lining up Beyonce — who headlined the Super Bowl halftime show back in 2013 — for a performance during a showcase game like this makes a ton of sense. Of course, there is a potential problem that will be monitored throughout the Christmas Day schedule, as the games will be aired on Netflix, which just struggled mightily with its broadcast of the boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Adding Beyonce to what will already be a highly-anticipated NFL game should only bring more eyeballs onto the platform, and there’s going to be a whole lot of interest in whether or not Netflix will be able to keep up with the demand."

	Jon Jones successfully defended his UFC Heavyweight championship at UFC 309 in New York.","Jon Jones (28-1) knocked out Stipe Miocic (20-5) in the third round to retain the heavyweight championship at UFC 309 from Madison Square Garden in New York.  Jones opened with a couple shots up top, a leg kick, and eventually a takedown. On top, Jones worked the ground and pound, refusing to give Miocic any room on the ground in a dominant first round — but while it looked like Jones could have ended it early, Miocic was able to hang on. Miocic opened the second round with a more measured approach, waiting for his own opportunities to attack without being taken down. The former heavyweight champion was relatively flat-footed before opening a more active approach in the third, but as Miocic moved, it was Jones who picked apart Miocic.  Jones hurt Miocic with a big right hand midway through the round, but kept the champ at bay with a combination of his own. Jones hurt Miocic with a spinning back kick to the body, then finished him off with lefts and rights on the ground before the referee stoppage.  Jones’ return to the UFC on Saturday was just his second bout in the heavyweight division. He hadn’t fought since last year, claiming the UFC Heavyweight belt in his debut in the heavyweight division against Ciryl Gane. Jones is arguably the greatest fighter in UFC history, but his background is riddled in controversy amid two victories over another greatest of all-time contender, Daniel Cormier. Miocic hadn’t fought since 2021, when he suffered a second-round knockout at the hands of Francis Ngannou.  Jones as the winner has an interesting path forward. On one hand, the interim champ, Tom Aspinall, is waiting in the wings and ready to prove himself against an all-time great. On the other hand, Alex Pereira seems prepped to climb to the heavyweight division, making possibly two weight jumps in three year as the former middleweight and current light heavyweight champion. Jones hasn’t seemed as interested in Aspinall recently, but opened the door to that fight after the win.  After his loss, Miocic retired from the UFC."

	Chuck, Shaq, Kenny, and Ernie will continue covering NBA games in 2025, as ESPN will license the show from TNT starting next year.","When TNT Sports lost the rights to the NBA this summer, with the league opting for a three-network deal with ESPN, NBC, and Amazon, the biggest question from fans was what would the future look like for ‘Inside the NBA’. After initially sounding as though it would end after this season, TNT was able to get Charles Barkley to agree to stick around for the remainder of his contract, with plans to continue the show in some capacity.  Now, we know what that will be, and instead of TNT airing the fellas talking about various sports (as was rumored at one point), they will continue to cover the NBA as part of ESPN’s NBA coverage in a unique licensing deal between Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. According to the Wall Street Journal and Andrew Marchand of The Athletic, the deal will see TNT Sports continue producing the show, but it will air on ESPN.  Separately, Warner Bros. Discovery struck a deal with Disney to license the TNT show “Inside the NBA” to ESPN and ABC starting next season, according to the people familiar with the matter. The show, which features the former players Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal, has an enthusiastic and large following. The show will air throughout the course of the season. This all happens alongside a larger settlement between the NBA and WBD, with Bleacher Report and House of Highlights maintaining rights to NBA videos. That is all excellent news for those at TNT Sports and those outlets, and sources inside TNT Sports tell Dime that they are “considering it a best case scenario” after losing NBA game broadcasts. [UPDATE: This post previously stated WBD would continue operating NBA TV and the league’s digital platforms, as was reported by the WSJ, but that was incorrect. NBA Digital and WBD will continue their current relationship but will not be operated by WBD (as is the current structure), while NBA TV will not be operated by WBD in the future.] For NBA fans the biggest news is that Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson will still be on our televisions — one would assume from Studio J in Atlanta still if TNT is producing it — each week during the NBA season. One would expect they’ll move from their Thursday slot to Wednesday for ESPN’s biggest night of games — as the other options are Friday and Sunday and I have a hard time imagining them moving to either of those. The move allows the best show to continue without any changes to talent in front of or behind the camera, which is particularly important, and one would think if ESPN is adding the show they will understand what makes it so good and give it the kind of space and time it deserves, rather than what they currently do with their studio offering. It remains to be seen what happens with NBA Countdown, as they’ll still need to have something for those Friday and Sunday games, but may shake up their main crew with the Inside fellas becoming their A-crew and Finals team."

	The NBA has big plans for how it wants to build on 2024's shooting competition between Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu.","The NBA struck gold at All-Star weekend in 2024. While the game itself was bad enough that the league is considering a major shake-up in its format and the Dunk Contest was a dud, a shooting contest between Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu injected a whole lot of excitement into the festivities on Saturday night — Curry was able to win, but it was awfully close. With the 2025 edition of the All-Star Game taking place in the Chase Center, it would make a ton of sense for the league to run back a Steph vs. Sabrina shootout. According to Shams Charania of ESPN, that is, indeed in the works, but there’s a catch: They may not be the only NBA and WNBA players involved. Curry and WNBA star Sabrina Ionescu of the New York Liberty participated in the first NBA versus WNBA 3-point challenge at All-Star Saturday night this February in Indianapolis. Curry and Ionescu are in strong conversations to return in a variation of the shootout, which could include other NBA and WNBA players such as Klay Thompson of the Dallas Mavericks and Caitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever, sources said. Expanding on the competition and including Thompson and Clark always made far too much sense, so it’s good to see that the NBA might do something that would obviously be a huge draw."

	The NBA is considering a shakeup to make the All-Star Game a 4-team tournament like Rising Stars -- and include the Rising Stars winners.","The last really good NBA All-Star Game was in 2020, which was both the first year of the Elam Ending format and just a few weeks after Kobe Bryant’s tragic death. Players took the game more seriously than we’ve seen in quite some time, as it was a league-wide celebration of the Lakers legend, but since then the game has fallen back into old habits of being a glorified pickup run with barely a hint of defense being played.  That has led to fans tuning out and TV networks being upset, and Adam Silver seemed like a broken man after last year’s game was the highest scoring in history, handing Giannis and the East the All-Star Game trophy with the glowing praise of “you scored the most points. Well, congratulations.” The truth is, the All-Star Game just isn’t important enough for players to go all-out, especially with how much money is at stake for them nowadays. It’s no longer the biggest national stage some of them will get to show out and build their profile, and the result is a bunch of guys trying not to get hurt while producing a few highlights.  For that reason, the league needs to get creative. We offered our thoughts on what that should look like last year, as they’ve bounced back-and-forth between formats and how they pick teams to varying degrees of success. This year we might see a significant change to the format, as ESPN’s Shams Charania brought word that the league is in deep discussions on a new format that would be similar what they did with the Rising Stars Game, breaking the All-Star rosters into 4 teams and having them play a semifinal game and then the winners of those playing in the final. The teams would be 3 teams of 8 All-Stars and the winning team of the Rising Stars Challenge from Friday. Charania highlights how discussions around this format started at Summer League and have included league personnel, team executives, players (including Stephen Curry), and coaches, with significant momentum towards being adopted for the 2025 game in San Francisco. At the very least, you could bet that whatever team of All-Stars got matched up with the Rising Stars winners would likely have a little more juice to not lose, which would yield the intended results of raising the level of competition.  I think anything would be an improvement over a regular four-quarter game, and the Rising Stars games have been improved as a result of this format change. Even if they aren’t suddenly the greatest basketball games in history, they move quicker and when it’s close late the competitive juices get flowing in a way we don’t see often in the current All-Star format."
Sports – UPROXX,It Is Silly That Nikola Jokic Has Somehow Gotten Better To Start The 2024-25 Season,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/nikola-jokic-start-2024-25-nba-season-denver-nuggets/,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 21:41:00 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	Nikola Jokic entered this season as an all-time great already. Somehow, someway, he keeps getting better.","There’s this fun thing I like to do sometimes that I affectionately call the Barry Bonds game. How it works: You go onto baseball-reference, pull up the page for the legendary San Francisco Giants slugger, and just look at how ridiculous it was that Bonds was able to put up the numbers he did during his prime. Yes, steroids, I know, but even with that caveat, individual players are not supposed to break their sport the way that Barry Bonds was able to break the game of baseball. We’re not fully there yet, but going onto Nikola Jokic‘s basketball-reference page is getting to a similarly very silly point. Ever since becoming the no-doubt cornerstone of the Denver Nuggets back in 2018-19, Jokic has consistently put up some of the wildest numbers in the league. His last four years feature three MVPs and a second-place finish while averaging 26.1 points, 12.2 rebounds, 8.7 assists, and 1.4 steals in 34.1 minutes per game while shooting 58.8 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from three. The advanced stats especially love him — scroll on down to the “Advanced” section, a lot of stuff is bold (led the league) and a few things are gold (all-time career marks). There is no one quite like Jokic, and there has never been anyone quite like Jokic. His career True Shooting percentage is third in league history, behind only Rudy Gobert and DeAndre Jordan, while attempting 1,942 more three-pointers than those two combined. His career total rebound percentage is 15th, right in between ABA legend Mel Daniels and Marcus Camby. He’s 25th all time in assist percentage — the three names directly behind him are Ja Morant, Ricky Rubio, and LeBron James. The dude just has his fingerprints all over games in a way that no one has ever consistently matched. I say all of that to say this: Somehow, someway, on a team that needs him more than ever (which says a lot as the entire franchise is built around having him), Jokic has raised his game through the first stretch of the 2024-25 season. This should not be possible. It’s not even like he’s suddenly adding something new to his bag of tricks, he’s just better than ever at being Nikola Jokic. Small sample size caveats are prominent here, but here’s some stuff to consider: Points per game: 29.7 (fifth in the NBA, his current career-high is 27.1 PPG)
Rebounds per game: 13.7 (leads the NBA, current career-high is 13.8 RPG)
Assists per game: 11.7 (leads the NBA, current career-high is 9.8 APG)
Steals per game: 1.7 (t-9th in the NBA, current career-high is 1.7 SPG) The only players to ever average a triple-double over a full season, of course, are Oscar Robertson (once) and Russell Westbrook (four times). Neither of them, in any of their triple-double seasons, were in the same galaxy as Jokic’s current True Shooting percentage of 66.7 percent — both guys, funny enough, posted a TS% of 55.4 percent in their most efficient season with a triple-double. And all of the advanced stats that tend to show that Jokic is a marvel (PER, win shares per 48 minutes, box plus/minus) are outrageous — if the season ended today, he’d post the highest single-season PER (33.31) of all-time, the highest BPM (15.02) of all-time, and the fourth-highest WS/48 of all-time behind some guys named Kareem and Wilt. So, yeah, Jokic is a joke, the single best basketball player in the world today and the guy spearheading a Nuggets team with some flaws that came as the result of a talent drain over the last few years to an early 7-3 record and, as of this writing, the longest-active winning streak (five games) in the Western Conference. And here’s the funny thing: If Denver did not have Jokic playing like this, they would be in some serious trouble. Have a look at how dire things get when he is not on the floor, via PBP Stats: There is a reason why, when asked what the ideal number of minutes is for Jokic to be on the floor for the Nuggets, Michael Malone said “48.” We’ve seen plenty of teams over the years be totally helpless when the sun around which everything revolves goes to the bench — LeBron’s teams in his prime were famously horrendous when he would sit, the Sixers have an organizational commitment to being awful without Joel Embiid, etc. — but seeing as how Jokic is either scoring or assisting on nearly half of all the points that Denver scores, well, it’s pretty important that he never comes off the floor. That’ll have to change at some point (well, probably), but Jokic playing like this means it’s easier for the Nuggets to slowly bring along their young guys who have to take on bigger roles this season — although it must be said that Christian Braun has impressed as the de facto Kentavious Caldwell-Pope replacement. They can also afford to be patient with Jamal Murray, who still hasn’t quite looked like himself on the heels of a pretty nasty run of injuries that made his postseason and Olympic efforts hard to watch at times, but just got paid in a big way and absolutely has to get on track. Of course, at some point, Denver is going to need to totally round into form, even if there are some really encouraging signs beyond Jokic. Aaron Gordon has been awesome so far this year when healthy, while Michael Porter Jr. continues to just do his thing as a huge dude who can shoot the hell out of the basketball. When 75 percent of the core your team is built around is playing at a high level from the start of the year — and that final member of your core has a reputation for saving his best for when the lights get brighter — you’re usually in a pretty good spot. There are still big picture questions that can only be answered when the playoffs roll around, which is the curse of being a team with title-or-bust aspirations. In the meantime, all anyone can really do is sit back, watch, and marvel at the spectacle that is Nikola Jokic, the best player in the world at the very height of his powers, someone who keeps finding ways to break the game of basketball, and an all-time great who stands shoulder-to-shoulder alongside the greatest players to ever set foot on the hardwood. And the scary part? As the early portion of this season has shown, if anything, he’s only getting better."

	'We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust.'","Tonight, November 15, is the much-publicized boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Ahead of the fight, which will stream on Netflix, Iron Mike was asked by internet-famous teen reporter Jazlyn Guerra, a.k.a. Jazzy’s World TV, for his thoughts on legacy. He took it very seriously.   “Well, I don’t know. I don’t believe in the word ‘legacy,'” Tyson replied. “I just think that’s another word for ego. Legacy doesn’t mean nothing. That’s just some word everybody grabbed onto. Someone said that word, and everyone grabbed on the words, and now it’s used every five seconds. It means absolutely nothing to me. I’m just passing through. I’mma die, and it’s gonna be over. Who cares about legacy after that?”  Tyson somehow wasn’t done. “What a big ego,” he continued. “So I’mma die. I want people to think that I’m this, I’m great. I’m, no. We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust. We’re absolutely nothing. Our legacy is nothing.” Guerra responded to Tyson’s stream-of-consciousness existentialism with a polite “thank you so much for sharing that,” but 50 Cent had another takeaway. “G*ddam it! Mike ya scaring the kids, WTF chill,” the rapper wrote on X. “Note to self, keep the kids away from Mike.”  You can watch the video here. Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson streams on Netflix beginning at 8 p.m. ET."

	This year's NBA City Edition unis were officially unveiled on Thursday, so we're ranking them from 30 to 1.","The NBA and Nike officially unveiled the 2024-25 City Edition uniforms for all 30 teams on Thursday, and while the designs have been leaked since this summer, I like to wait until we get the official images to rank them. That is because the actual jerseys themselves almost always look better than their 2D mock-ups, which is certainly the case with this year’s crop. The leaks got roasted to no end on social media and while I’m not crazy about this year’s group of uniforms, they aren’t as bad in actuality as the leaks looked.  That said, there are some heaters and some really bad ones, along with a big crop this year of very “meh” looks as it’s fair to wonder if Nike and the teams are running a bit short on ideas — good news guys, at least another 12 years of these! Here we are ranking the uniforms from worst to best, where there’s one that should become part of one team’s permanent look.  NBA
Creating good alternates is hard when you have an iconic jersey set, and that’s the problem the Celtics (and Lakers) run into every year. These are just bad and don’t even seem to be trying to do anything interesting. Wear your normal (and great) uniforms, please.  NBA
Same goes for the Lakers. These are just unbecoming of a once proud franchise.  NBA
I’m honestly kind of stunned they went back to the Heat Culture well again after the reaction to when they did this last year, but it does look a little better on the all red uniform. Still, c’mon guys, stop trying to make this a thing. NBA
On the opposite end of the spectrum from Boston and L.A. is OKC, which has had one uniform in its history that I thought was legitimately good (the 2018 City Edition honoring Oklahoma’s Native American heritage). Everything else has been either “meh” or outright bad. I’ll say this, these aren’t the worst unis they’ve ever had, but I just am not a fan.  NBA
The Pacers have done this look before in black, and it’s just not for me.  NBA
A retro look that just doesn’t really land for me. I will say, I bet the court they have for this color scheme will look great, but I’m just not a big fan of the lettering.  NBA
I wouldn’t call these bad, they just don’t land for me, but that’s also been the case for a number of the Brooklyn City Editions over the years.  NBA
I’m just out on the 5280 thing. I like the mountains on the side and the topographical map thing, and while I think there are better executions, leaning into the rainbow coloring is generally good for Denver. However, I just can’t get on board with the 5280 in place of lettering. NBA
All of the uniforms in this tier have the same issue of not being bad, but also not being particularly inspiring. Dallas’ are particularly plain, which, again, not necessarily bad, but not memorable either.  NBA
I get they’re going for the Chicago musical font here, but it feels like they weren’t willing to go all-in on it and the end result is pretty bland.  NBA
I get what Minnesota’s going for, but I just see an old Windows 98 screensaver in that design.  NBA
They aren’t as bad as the Lakers and Celtics, but they also have a similar problem where their normal uniforms are iconic classics and trying something new often just makes you want them to do what they always do.  NBA
The Magic are at the top of this group by virtue of having the best lettering/logo — the Magic with a star for the A is always great — but Orlando has great uniform looks and this one just falls flat comparatively.  NBA
Like Orlando, Charlotte has some great throwback looks and this just makes me wish they were wearing one of those instead.  NBA
My colleague Mark said the logo looks like it should be for store brand paper towels and I can’t unsee it. I do like that shade of blue though.  NBA
Perfectly fine, even though it’s still a little confusing when the Bucks are wearing all-blue.  NBA
Never seen a more Oklahoma State jersey in my life. Go Pokes.  NBA
I actually kinda like these, but they are giving off strong vibes of made up Houston jerseys for a movie that couldn’t afford NBA licensing.  NBA
If I were to guess, these will be among the most polarizing unis. I dig New Orleans leaning into being a little different and weird, and the herringbone pattern with actual bones certainly does that. They will likely be at the bottom of some folks rankings but I don’t think their standard unis are so good that they can’t get weird and have it work.  NBA
These have grown on me a bit, in part because they at least look like Warriors uniforms — unlike their Michigan/Marquette alternates from a year or two ago. They aren’t the best uniforms in the world, but a solid attempt at playing off something unique to the Bay (the Golden Gate Bridge).  NBA
I really like the District font and this year they put it on a nice color instead of whatever the hell the black and green and orange thing was a year ago. The Wizards won’t be good this year, but I do think they’ll look good in these.  NBA
I like this Spurs font, they’ve done it before but it works for me. I also like this shade of blue. These aren’t as good as their fiesta look in the past, but a solid choice and I just like when the Spurs have a little pop of color.  NBA
I like these, even though I will not immediately spot this color and go “Cavs” in my brain. Part of why these will work is their court that goes with them is phenomenal.  NBA
Another one that gets a big boost from an unbelievably good court design. These play off the old 1995 All-Star logo, and while I’m not crazy about the font, I still dig them. If they incorporated the saguaro cactus into them, they’d be higher.  NBA
The Blazers almost always do a good job with the City edition uni, and this year is another good addition to their rotation. A big part of that is their “Rip City” font just looks good on anything. NBA
The Jazz are finally making the move back to the purple mountains with their full-time uniform set, and this year’s City Edition is a very good version of that.  NBA
The throwback to the Memphis Sounds just looks fantastic. I love that Memphis font and these are going to look fantastic on the floor — even if it’ll take a little adjustment to seeing a team in red and thinking “Grizzlies”.  NBA
The Kings also have another really good throwback look, taking it to the days of the Cincinnati Royals. The royal blue and red just pops, and they didn’t try to do too much with a uniform that doesn’t need much more.  NBA
I’m a sucker for this spectrum Sixers look. I just think it’s so clean and the white edition is even better than the navy look from a couple years back.  NBA
The Vince Carter Raptor doing his legendary between-the-legs dunk is so good and the Raptors need to just make it their permanent logo. These with the purple retro look they brought back this year is a damn-near perfect uniform set and it’s a shame they will move on to something new next season."

	Come get these winners.","Sometimes, you simply want to unplug the season and plug it back in. That is where we are when it comes to NFL handicapping in 2024. After a pair of encouraging weeks, the ugliness returned in Week 10, including a Falcons-Saints game that impossibly stayed under with three missed field goals and other malodies. We won’t be deterred from the goal of righting the ship but, hey, you could also fade these picks if you’re feeling spicy. Before delivering this week’s five-pack, let’s take a look at the carnage in 2024.  Come get these winners. A Thursday night Under? Let’s get back to basics. Washington has been an “over” team to the tune of 7-3 this season, but Philadelphia has been quietly stout on defense in recent weeks. This is, of course, a short week for both teams, and Washington has some injury issues along its offensive line. I tend to think the Commanders defense is a touch undervalued in this spot as well, and this is a favorable price. The Saints got the bounce last week after firing their coach and, with the help of one of the worst kicking performances of the season for Atlanta, New Orleans won a game it shouldn’t have won. That could benefit us this week, as the Browns are underdogs in a spot where they probably shouldn’t be. Let’s ride the Jameis roller coaster and hope it goes well. Detroit is a wagon. They seemingly cover every week and, when they don’t like in Week 10, they somehow win the game despite a million turnovers. With that said, getting a full 14 here on Jacksonville is something I can’t pass on. Trust me, I know how ugly it is. Seattle is healthier and coming off a bye, including the projected return of DK Metcalf. I’ve also been a touch low on San Francisco all season, and I simply can’t get this to 6.5 points, even with McCaffrey back for the 49ers. This teaser happens to involve a pair of prime time games, but I would like it even if it didn’t. Candidly, I love each leg here, with the Bengals more than able to get in the backdoor if things go south at the outset. Houston is on the road, which does scare me a bit, but the situation in Dallas is rather dire, and the Texans may be discounted a bit after a maddening loss to Detroit."

	Giannis got called for a foul despite getting all ball. But fortunately for the Bucks, as Rasheed Wallace once said, ball don't lie.","The Milwaukee Bucks played host to the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night, and while there is still a ton of basketball left to be played this season, you won’t find a more insane final 90 or so seconds of regulation than what we got out of these two Central Division opponents. The two teams traded the lead back and forth, and after a Marcus Sasser three tied things up with just under 30 seconds left, Milwaukee got the ball and had a chance to win. A wide open look by Taurean Prince did not fall, and with a hair over a second left on the clock, Detroit called a timeout, advanced the ball, and tried to replicate the magic it found on a sideline out of bounds play on Tuesday night against Miami. It looked like that was going to happen, as Cade Cunningham lobbed one up to Ron Holland near the rim, but Giannis Antetokounmpo was able to break things up … well, at least it looked like he did, but the referees called a foul that stood after a review even though it really did not look like Giannis fouled Holland at all. However, in the words of the great philosopher Rasheed Wallace, ball don’t lie. Holland stepped up to the charity stripe and missed short twice, which ended up sending the game to overtime. It would’ve been an awfully harsh way for the game to end for Milwaukee, but, again, Sheed’s got us covered here."

It went the way that things tend to go when teams travel to take on the Golden State Warriors: Steph Curry did some absolutely ludicrous Steph stuff, and the Warriors went on to pick up a 120-117 win to start their NBA Cup campaign. Curry scored all 12 of the Warriors’ points during a 12-3 run to close out the game, and plenty of people noted that he looked especially fired up after hitting a three with 27 seconds left that essentially iced things. It turns out there’s a reason why: According to Draymond Green, Curry was ghosted by Thompson in the lead-up to the game. “I’m stirring the pot, I pissed Steph off,” Green said on his podcast, which you can watch at the 4:30 mark of the video at the top of this post. “He’s like, ‘Yeah, I talked to Klay last night about’ — cause he was supposed to speak before the game. He was like, ‘Yeah I called Raymond and told him I’m not speaking. I just need to lock in on the game, so I ain’t speaking and I talked to Klay about it.’ He tried to check in with Klay about something else, and Klay ghosted him, so he got pissed. And here we go. Locked in.” Steve Kerr said that Curry was supposed to address the crowd before the game, but he and Thompson decided against it, while Green did drop a hint after the game that Thompson isn’t an easy guy to get a hold of when he told the press “You ever try to keep in touch with Klay?

	The legendary Spurs coach has been away from the team since Nov. 2.","The San Antonio Spurs have been without the services of legendary head coach Gregg Popovich since the start of November. While the team previously said that Popovich’s absence was due to an illness, on Wednesday afternoon, the Spurs revealed that Popovich suffered what was described as a “mild stroke” ahead of their game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 2, 2024. “The San Antonio Spurs today announced that Head Coach Gregg Popovich has suffered a mild stroke,” the team said in a statement. “The episode occurred on Nov. 2 at the Frost Bank Center. Popovich, who has already started a rehabilitation program, is expected to make a full recovery. At this point, a timeline for his return to the sidelines has not been determined. During this time, the organization is grateful to the extended community for providing privacy and space to the Popovich family.” Assistant coach Mitch Johnson, who has been part of the Spurs’ famed coaching system since 2016, has filled in for Popovich as he’s been away from the team for the last six games. When asked last week for an update on Popovich, Johnson said that the Hall of Fame coach was “in good spirits,” even though there was no word on when fans could expect to see Popovich back on the sideline. One of the greatest basketball coaches of all time, the 75-year-old Popovich has been at the helm of the Spurs since 1996. He is a 5-time NBA champion, a 3-time Coach of the Year, and is the NBA’s all-time wins leader among coaches."

	Let's be honest, Charles Barkley and Shaq were always going to do this at some point.","It’s been a rough start to the year for the Toronto Raptors. While they were never expected to compete for a championship this year, injuries to a number of key contributors like Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickly have played a big role in the team going 2-10, which is the worst record in the league at this early juncture. A bright spot has been the play of Gradey Dick, the No. 13 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who is shooting 37.3 percent from three and his upped his scoring to 20.1 points per game. He’s a good player whose last name has led to stuff like this happening, and shockingly, it was not until Tuesday night that the Inside the NBA guys had their inevitable meltdown over him.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  “This boy’s ballin right here, y’all,” Charles Barkley told the crew. “I think you pointed that out, Gradey Dick,” Ernie Johnson responded. “I can’t say his name,” Barkley shot back. “I just can’t say his name. I’m not gonna say his name, I don’t give a damn what y’all say around here.” It was right around this point that we got one of the consistently funniest things on Inside: Shaq laughing so hard at something insane that Chuck said that he sounds like he’s furiously trying to clear his throat. Anyway, the fellas kept going down this road for a bit longer, because there was never going to be any stopping this riff once it finally happened. As for how the rest of Dick’s night went, he scored a career-best 32 points with five rebounds and three assists in a 99-85 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks."

	There was some extra juice in the building for Klay Thompson's return to the Bay, and Steph reminded the fans whose house it was late.","The biggest game of the night in a packed slate of NBA Cup games was the Mavs taking on the Warriors in Klay Thompson’s first game back in San Francisco since leaving as a free agent this summer for Dallas.  It was an emotional scene as they played a terrific tribute video and had the crowd in captains hats to honor their former star, but once the game got going there was plenty of juice on both sides in a reunion that wasn’t all happy. The two teams went back and forth, as the stars on both sides all played their roles, with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combining for 52 for the Mavs, while Thompson hit 6 threes on his way to 22 points in his return, including a big one late that gave Dallas a five-point lead midway through the fourth quarter.  That lead would get up to seven before Stephen Curry took over for the Warriors, scoring 12 points in the final 3:10 of game time, including a personal 10-0 run (aided by some spectacular defense from Draymond Green) that turned a Golden State deficit into a 4-point Warriors lead. His final bucket of that run was a vintage stepback three-pointer over Dereck Lively II, as he hit the Mavs big man with his signature “night night” celebration, before making a demonstrative declaration to the crowd that “this is my sh*t.”  STEPH CURRY HAS THE LAST 10 WARRIORS POINTS. 10-2 run to put GSW up 4 with under 30 seconds. 🏆 DAL-GSW | West Group C action🏀 #EmiratesNBACup on TNT pic.twitter.com/xNxak7xWr5 — NBA (@NBA) November 13, 2024  The Mavs would hit a three to cut the lead to one, but a pair of Curry free throws and a missed Luka three saw the Warriors win in regulation, 120-117. Curry finished with 37 points in the win, and while it’s clear there’s not actual bad blood between either side in the Splash Bros. breakup, there did seem to be a little extra fire from Curry for a mid-November game to make a statement at home with Klay now on the other side. While the “night night” is nothing new, the jersey popping and yelling “this is my sh*t” was more than we ever see from Curry in a non-playoff environment, and while I am a fan of the NBA Cup and think it brings out more competition in these games, I think this had more to do with who was on the other side than the Cup ramifications of this game."

	Shaq, who is never shy about being brutally honest when modern big men come up, did not mince words about Joel Embiid.","Joel Embiid took the floor for the Philadelphia 76ers for the first time this season on Tuesday night. Embiid, who has spent the start of the year ramping up to play after some knee problems, looked like someone who needs to work off a ton of rust, as he went for 13 points on 2-for-11 shooting with five assists and three rebounds in a 111-99 loss to the New York Knicks. It’s probably safe to assume that Embiid will be fine as long as he can manage whatever is up with his knee, while the Sixers — which find themselves 2-8 at this early juncture — have to get him, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey all healthy and clicking as soon as possible. But even if that happens, Shaquille O’Neal is not optimistic about Philly’s ability to win a ring with Embiid at the center of things, which he expressed at halftime on TNT. “In New York, it’s a tough team to play,” O’Neal said. “But this was the fear I had for Joel Embiid. You announce arrogantly, I’m not playing back-to-backs, Ernie. I’m not injured but I’m sore. I’ll come back when I want to come back. Now, when you say things like that, you’re supposed to come back with extra energy. 0-for-3? I would have been 0-15. But you know what y’all would have said. ‘Hey, Shaq’s not playing well, but he’s playing aggressive.’ The plan that they are having, it’s not working. And not only that, I say this respectfully, Joel Embiid will never win a championship until he gets his mind and his attitude right.” Shaq has essentially staked out a place in the basketball punditry world as the guy who will call out big men when he feels they aren’t living up to what they’re capable of, and clearly, he thinks Embiid is the kind of guy who can lead Philadelphia to a championship. In fairness to Embiid, while he did say he may not play in back-to-backs going forward in an effort to be healthy when the playoffs roll around, he said after the loss to the Knicks that he wants to play in Wednesday’s game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, even if the decision is out of his hands."

	With the game tied in overtime, Miami tried calling a timeout. There was just one problem: They didn't have one available.","The second annual Emirates NBA Cup tipped off on Tuesday night, with a number of teams taking the (very vibrant) floor for the league’s relatively new in-season tournament. In the East Group B, the Detroit Pistons played host to the Miami Heat and looked like they were going to cruise to a win before Miami got hot down the stretch of regulation. With things tied up, the two teams went into overtime, where Miami was able to take a lead with just under two seconds left before things got very, very weird. First, the Pistons drew up a beautiful sideline out of bounds play to get a dunk for Jalen Duren that tied things up. And then, a furious Erik Spoelstra walked onto the court and called a timeout. There was just one problem: Miami didn’t have one, which meant we had a classic Chris Webber situation on our hands — perhaps it was fate that one of Webber’s Fab 5 teammates, Jalen Rose, was in attendance and lost his mind. Malik Bealey stepped up to the free throw line, buried it to put Detroit ahead, then on the ensuing Pistons possession, got fouled one more time with 0.1 seconds left to seal the game. It was, quite frankly, stunning to watch Spoelstra make such a big mistake, but at the very least, we got a really entertaining end to a game that suddenly has some stakes to it because of the NBA Cup."

	Caitlin Clark found a very unique pitfall of fame at The Eras Tour: Getting so many friendship bracelets you start to lose circulation.","Taylor Swift’s “The Eras Tour” has been the biggest show in the world for the past few years, as the tour has had millions of fans pass through the gates at stadiums around the globe. After finishing her international leg of the tour, Swift added another run of U.S. tour dates, which included recently playing three nights in Indianapolis at the start of November.  In attendance for those shows was the biggest sports star in the city at present, as Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark wasn’t about to miss a chance to see her favorite artist play shows in her new home city. The only problem for Caitlin at the Eras Tour was that she’s too popular in Indianapolis, which meant she was being constantly given friendship bracelets from other Swifties. That’s a very nice problem to have, but in her effort to wear every one she was given, it started to create an issue, as she explained at the Women’s Leadership Summit.  “Taylor Swift, I just went two nights in a row in Indianapolis. I’ve been three times,” Clark said. “I had a ton [of bracelets], all the way up the arms. I had to take them off, my circulation was getting cut off! Everyone was just chucking their bracelets at me. I’ve seen her three times, and every time the show has just gotten better.”  She showed off her collection on Instagram during one of the shows and it was a lot of bracelets.  Clark has spent the last year or two learning the ups and downs of life as a superstar, but this is certainly a very unique pitfall of fame, being so popular you get too many friendship bracelets and start to lose feeling in your arm."

	The NBA Cup is back for a second season, and here's how it will all work and what groups each team ended up in.","The NBA’s efforts to add a little excitement to the doldrums of its regular season will return on Tuesday evening. For the second straight year, the league will hold its new cup competition, now known as the Emirates NBA Cup. The first year was fun, with the Los Angeles Lakers winning the whole thing by knocking off the Indiana Pacers in Las Vegas, and now, the NBA will continue its efforts to turn this nascent event into a crucial part of its calendar. What does this all mean? Well, we tried to answer that today by explaining what’s new this year, how the whole thing will work, and why we’re excited to watch this as it tries to become a tentpole event on the NBA calendar. So is this just the In-Season Tournament but with a new name? It is! While the NBA has never explicitly said this, my assumption is that they spent the first year calling it the In-Season Tournament so fans would get a sense of what it is before calling it what they always wanted to call it: The NBA Cup, or more specifically, the Emirates NBA Cup. Or maybe they just couldn’t find a sponsor in the first year. What’s that Emirates thing? I’ve seen its logo on courts but never actually looked into what it is. It’s an airline based out of the United Arab Emirates that sponsors a lot of stuff. They’re sponsoring this event, which is the second-best thing that the NBA does, and fortunately, Emirates has plenty of experience sponsoring the second-best thing, as they are the shirt sponsor for Arsenal. What? Just let me cook. Ok, so, any major differences from last year other than the name? A big one are the courts. Last year, they came under criticism from players (who kept slipping on them) and fans (who thought some were huge eyesores, particularly because of the weird, cumbersome stripe they had going down the middle of the courts). They’re not nearly as bad this year, as they replaced the stripe with rings in the center of the floor and got rid of some of the more abrasive designs that just do not work on television. I’m sure not everyone will love them, but I think they are a huge improvement on last year — we just have to see if players struggle with their footing on them, or else the aesthetic changes do not matter at all. What about point differential? I know some players disliked that. Well, that’s still sticking around as a potential tiebreaker for which teams do and do not advance. Frankly, I think it’s fine and we saw last year that some of the European players were trying to egg their teammates on — Domantas Sabonis was the main one I remember — but it’ll still take a bit of a shift for everyone to get on board with it. Remind me how determining how teams advance will work again? Sure! Right from the league: So the easiest way to move on is to just win your group and not worry about any tiebreakers. That is correct. Well then, what do the groups look like? Once again, the NBA broke things up into three groups of five teams in each conference — this will, hopefully, look a lot cleaner when expansion happens, we get up to 32 teams, and they can do groups of four in each conference where each team plays group games home and away. The group games will happen on Tuesdays and Fridays starting tonight and running through Dec. 3. Here’s how it all looks: West Group A: Minnesota, LA Clippers, Sacramento, Houston, Portland West Group B: Oklahoma City, Phoenix, LA Lakers, Utah, San Antonio West Group C: Denver, Dallas, New Orleans, Golden State, Memphis East Group A: New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Charlotte East Group B: Milwaukee, Indiana, Miami, Toronto, Detroit East Group C: Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington How do these teams qualify for the knockouts? Same as last year — win your group and you get a spot. Both conferences then get one remaining spot for a wild card team, which goes to the best remaining team that did not automatically qualify by winning its group. This is probably where those aforementioned tiebreakers would come in, but you never know. And will the knockouts work like last year, too? Yup! Single-elimination basketball games, with the quarterfinals happening on-site at home arenas and the semifinals and final happening in Las Vegas. The quarters are on Dec. 10 and 11, the semis are on Dec. 14, and the final is on Dec. 17. And are these games all considered regular season games, too? For the most part they are — group games, the quarters, and the semis will all count towards regular season records again, while the championship game will not. So it looks a lot like last year, then. That’s right, the league has, essentially, decided to keep a lot of things the same other than the name and the courts. Oh, also, as a programming note: home teams will wear their Statement Edition uniforms, while road teams wear their Association edition uniforms, according to the league. Huh, well then, ok. You don’t seem enthused about all of this, dear reader. Yeah, I mean, I am still unsure why I should care about this. Well that’s easy: You don’t have to! You’re an adult with agency and the ability to care about whatever you want, times are tough, maybe you don’t want to get super personally invested in a new thing the NBA is doing, that’s fine. But you seem to like this. I do! Why? I think a big split I have noticed here is “fans who like soccer” and “fans who do not,” with the former being more open to the idea of a midseason cup competition — Adam Silver has compared the NBA Cup to the FA Cup in English football, but basically every domestic league has a secondary cup competition. The thing is that these competitions are universally considered not as important as winning the league, but they are still important because it’s an opportunity to win something historic and provide some validation for a team’s season. The NBA Cup is only in its second year, so clearly, it has a way to go before it gets taken that seriously — the whole saga with the Lakers debating putting up a little banner is an example of this. But the FA Cup, for example, is not considered cool because everyone farts around and then Manchester City wins it at the end. It’s considered cool because teams from several levels of English football have a chance to win it, and sometimes, you get magical runs to the very end. We got a glimpse of what that could look like last year when the Indiana Pacers nearly won the whole thing. Hell, if not for the fact that they’re the Lakers, it’d probably be viewed as proof of concept that the final was between a Play-In team and an upstart young squad trying to win something for the first time. That is, to steal a phrase from the English, the magic of the cup. So acknowledging that this isn’t as important as winning the NBA Finals is fine? One-hundred percent. The longer the NBA sticks with this — and, let’s face it, Silver is essentially staking his legacy as a commissioner on this becoming a big deal — the more likely it is that it’ll settle into a spot where fans/franchises like that it is a thing that they can win, all while understanding that the big prize is still waiting for them in June. It helps, of course, that there’s a financial incentive to do well. Remind me what that is. Sure! Players whose teams make the quarterfinals make $50,000, players whose teams make the semifinals make $100,000, players on the runners-up make $200,000, and players on the team that wins the whole thing makes $500,000. Nice. I agree. Anyway, this sounds like, bare minimum, a thing I can have on my television on Tuesdays and Fridays. It is, and really, if that’s all that comes from this for the next year or two, that’s totally fine. Something like this will only become a big deal the more it happens and the more it becomes ingrained as part of the sport’s culture, and as long as this year is a step towards doing that, I’m sure it’ll all work out in the long-run. Nice. Well, I suppose I can tune in. That you can, and if you want to know what games are on, when they’re on, and which networks they’ll be on, you can click right here."

	The NBA Cup starts Tuesday night and we are looking at eight teams that should invest a little extra energy in the early season competition.","The second edition of the NBA Cup (now with a fancy sponsor, Emirates) will begin on Tuesday night as group stage action gets started. Feelings on the NBA Cup vary, but for the most part, it seems to have been at least a mild positive in terms of adding a little juice to November regular season hoops.  Last year, the eight teams that emerged from group play were the Celtics, Bucks, Pacers, and Knicks in the East, and the Lakers, Kings, Suns, and Pelicans in the West. Ultimately, the Lakers beat the Pacers in the final, marking the high point of the season for Los Angeles, while that was just the beginning of a run to the conference finals from Indiana. There are differing views from teams on how they approach the Cup, but because most of the games until you get to Vegas count all the same as regular season games, you should see contenders still trying at least until the quarterfinals where they may punt to avoid adding a trip to Vegas to their schedule.  Not every team has the Cup schedule circled on their calendars, and for some, it gets in the way of the long-term goals (either to get lottery balls or winning a title). But as the Pacers showed a year ago, for a young team without much playoff experience, the Cup can get guys feet wet to that kind of environment and build some confidence for the tournament everyone cares about come April, May, and June.  Here, we’ll look at eight teams that we think should be willing to invest early season energy into trying to get to Vegas and hoist the NBA Cup.   Houston’s gotten off to a strong start this season at 7-4, and I think they’re in a similar position to the Pacers last year, as they can use this as a way to test their young roster without much playoff experience. A successful run to the knockout rounds (and maybe beyond) would be a genuinely big deal for the Rockets, who can assert themselves as a genuine threat in the West playoff race with a strong tournament showing.  We saw that the Lakers were willing to raise their level a year ago in the Cup competition, and it’d be kind of incredible if they went back-to-back. Their group is a bit less daunting now that the Thunder are without Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein (although that’s still an excellent team), and if they make the knockout rounds, a team with LeBron and AD is always going to be a threat in a single-elimination basketball game. We’ll see if they approach it with the same aggression, but this is a team that has to try and chase wins regardless, so I’d expect the effort to be there, even if they can’t replicate the same kind of run.  The Grizzlies want to prove they are fully back as West contenders, and they can make a strong statement if they come out of the aforementioned Group of Death. They are playing at a high level right now, led by Jaren Jackson Jr.’s continued brilliance, and if they can get to Vegas, they’d have a very good chance at lifting the Cup. And if Ja Morant can get healthy and come back in time, absolutely no one will want to see that guy in a one-off. By the time the season is over, the Spurs will likely have filtered out of the Play-In race, but this is the exact kind of team I think should place an overemphasis on the NBA Cup. The Spurs are still building around Victor Wembanyama and figuring out what that should look like, but this team has been fairly competitive early (5-6) and could take advantage of some injury woes for the top teams in their group to try and make a little noise in the Cup. We saw in the Olympics that Wemby loves some heightened competition, and this might be a good chance to turn him loose and make an all-out push for something in November, understanding that they probably don’t have the roster just yet to really threaten the playoffs.  Will the Cavs ever lose? At some point, yes, but why not keep the good vibes rolling as long as possible and try to win the Cup? Yes, they’re a title contender, but unlike, say, Boston, this isn’t a team that’s had any real playoff success. Building some good habits in the knockout rounds could pay dividends down the road, and seeing as how they’re in the same group as the Celtics, I’m sure they’d love to use this as a statement of intent in the event they cross paths in the postseason. The Bucks desperately need something to turn around their season, and maybe the Cup gives them a carrot to chase that can wake things up. I’m skeptical they have the juice to make this happen, as the vibes are just horrendous in Milwaukee right now, but theoretically, Giannis and Dame (who will miss their opener with a concussion) are good enough as a tandem to beat anyone. That will require them to get on the same page, which hasn’t really happened to this point, but perhaps playing on different courts can change the mojo in Milwaukee.  Like every team other than the Cavs and Celtics in the East, the Knicks are off to a sputtering start at 4-5. Their star-studded roster isn’t clicking just yet, the defense has taken a major step back, and the offense hasn’t been quite good enough to make up for it. Their group, at one point, looked like the toughest in the East, but the Magic are without Paolo Banchero and the Sixers … well, we’ll get to them in a second. That cracks the door for the Knicks to try and lay a foundation of winning they can build on as the season progresses and create that chemistry that’s been lacking in games with a slightly bigger game feel. Joel Embiid is back for the Cup games, but Tyrese Maxey is out and Paul George has been on a minutes restriction. This team is desperate to go on a run, and with the big fella back, there’s no time like the present to try and climb out of the East’s basement. Like the Bucks, Philly just needs to stack some wins and get some positivity, and if they can somehow make it to Vegas, they can erase a decent amount of the early season concern about them."
Sports – UPROXX,How Darius Garland And The Cavs Got Their Confidence Back,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/darius-garland-interview-cleveland-cavaliers-confidence/,"Mon, 11 Nov 2024 21:37:23 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	The Cavs are off to an 11-0 start, and we talked to Garland about the work this summer that led to the return of his confidence and smile.","The Cleveland Cavaliers came into the 2024-25 season with plenty of pressure, as this felt like a make-it-or-break-it season for their Core Four. They re-signed Donovan Mitchell and gave contract extensions to Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, while Darius Garland is entering the second year of his own 5-year deal. A ton of money has been committed to this group, with the expectation that they would take another step forward as a real threat in the Eastern Conference under new head coach Kenny Atkinson.  While they can’t fully answer whether they’ve done that until May and June, the Cavs have made an emphatic statement to open the season, as they are the NBA’s last remaining unbeaten at 11-0. That hot start is the byproduct of confidence and trust in their group, something they’ve built over the years but had to fortify by figuring out how everyone can play to their strengths. One of the difficult tasks of building confidence as a unit is that each player has to first have that confidence in themselves. The story of the young season for Cleveland has been strides in that area by the two youngest members of their core, as Garland and Mobley are playing some of the best basketball of their careers.  For Garland, he’s bounced back after a difficult 2023-24 campaign that saw him suffer a broken jaw early in the year and never get fully back to his peak level. As he explained to DIME over the weekend, after missing a third of the season, he wasn’t too interested in vacations this summer, instead opting to get in the gym and build back the strength, confidence, and wiggle that had been missing at the end of last season.  “It’s a total difference. It’s a big difference,” Garland said of how he feels starting this season compared to the second half of last year. “I’m in a good head space right now. I’m fully healthy — some little nicks, but nothing too major right now. And yeah, just came in with a lot of confidence over the summer, put in a lot of work. Especially after last year, I didn’t play a lot of games, so wasn’t a lot of vacations for me this summer, or a lot of hangout time. It was really just strictly in the gym trying to get better, trying to put some more weight and some more muscle on that I lost from last year, from having to jaw surgery. And yeah, trying to get my confidence back, trying to get my wiggle back, and my ball handling and just trying to stay consistent with it.”  Garland’s summer in the gym helped him remember how much he loves the game. One of the lasting images from the end of last season for Garland and the Cavs was Donovan Mitchell on the bench putting his arm around Garland and saying “I believe in you,” as Garland was mired in the midst of a shooting slump. It was a touching moment between teammates, but also telling of how difficult things were for Garland, who had lost his perpetual smile and was finding it difficult to have that same sense of belief.  This season, his confidence is back, as is his infectious smile, and Garland is looking to spread that positivity beyond the court as well. For Veteran’s Day weekend, that means welcoming a pair of Gold Star families from the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) to the Cavs’ games against the Nets and Bulls, as Garland is helping honor a pair of families of fallen veterans from his hometown of Gary, IN.  “It’s super cool just to have some veteran families around me,” Garland said. “My grandfathers were veterans, so just trying to show some love and support for some of the families, and show that they’re loved and that they mean a lot to us, and we know how it is battling some things that they’ve gone through and that they’ve been through. So yeah, just to have their backs and just show that they’re loved and that we really appreciate it.” Both families have ties to Garland, as his mother went to high school with both of the fallen service members. He wants to take the opportunity his platform provides to show them love and do his favorite thing: put a smile on someone’s face. “I try to do it a little bit more often now, especially to kids and those with special needs,” Garland said. “I was one of the kids growing up looking up to Kobe, LeBron, Dame Lillard, Steph, so when I was growing up and they were giving back to younger kids and other people, I just always wanted to do the same. I know that it’ll just make their whole day and change the way that they look at things. So, trying to do it often and just try to put a smile on somebody’s face. That always means a lot to me, because I always wear a smile on my face.”   A post shared by Cavs Care (@cavscare_)  The way the Cavs have played so far this season has put an awful lot of smiles on faces in Cleveland, and Garland credits their hot start to the connectivity of the group and the confidence that’s instilled up and down the roster. This is the third year together for the Core Four, and many of their reserves have also been part of the team for at least a year or two. That familiarity has created a culture of accountability, with Garland noting that from players to coaches to the training staff, there’s a camaraderie that allows for honest conversations that make everyone better.  The newest face in the room is head coach Kenny Atkinson, as he took over for JB Bickerstaff (now in Detroit) with aspirations of taking this group to the next level. Garland, like everyone else in Cleveland, has been impressed with how Atkinson hit the ground running with the Cavs, and highlighted the way he instills confidence in everyone as the biggest thing he’s brought to the team. “He was a player, so he knows what it’s like playing a lot of games, and just having that confidence out on the floor — I mean, when you have that confidence, I think you just get boosted a little bit more,” Garland said. “You think that you can do anything and make any kind of shot, and that’s what our team has right now. We’re shooting the ball with confidence, making plays with confidence, and we’re doing it on both ends of the floor, and I think that’s where he’s just instilling us. Even at film, when we don’t shoot a shot we’re wide open, he’s going to get on us about shooting the ball, because that might be the only good shot that we have in that possession. So he wants us to shoot every ball with confidence, shoot every open one and just keep continuing to play hard and trust each other.” Garland has always been a good shooter, but last season, that confidence in his shot waned a bit, particularly in the postseason. That gave Garland plenty of motivation this summer, where he stripped his game back down to the basics and built it back up with a focus on the little details that go a long way in the games.  “Just trying to pay attention to details,” Garland said. “Just try to do all the little things to make me a better scorer, make me a better shooter. Literally the smallest things, like getting my feet ready, staying down low before I even get the ball. I mean, just literally everything, all the little things. I really went back from square one, from when I started basketball and just worked my way up until I could really start moving and going full speed for the entire summer. So I really went back to the basics this summer, and just tried to clean everything up and just try to polish everything, and getting some of the results back right now.”  The results are the best shooting percentages of his career from every level, with splits of 53.8/47.5/95.0 through the first 11 games. He’s finishing better than he ever has at the rim, a byproduct of the strength he added over the summer, and he’s shooting threes at a higher rate and making more of them than he ever has as a pro. That’s a lethal combination, and he certainly seems to have found that wiggle off the bounce once again, helped by his decisiveness and confidence with the ball as both a shooter and driving to attack the defense.  Garland is far from alone in having a strong start, as the Cavs are finding a way to feed off each other and recognizing how each of them can make the others better. Along with Garland’s return to All-Star form, Mobley has become a bigger part of the offense and is a big beneficiary of that boost of confidence Atkinson has provided. Mobley playing with more force and freedom on both ends of the floor raises their ceiling, and Garland is quick to note how his play opens up so much of the floor for everyone else, calling him “our catalyst.” “He gets us going on both ends of the floor, and he can do so many things, especially on offensive side of the ball,” Garland said. “We can set a 1-5 pick and roll with him, and I go set a pick-and-roll, or Don go set a pick-and-roll for him, and let him just work off that screen. And when he gets downhill he’s a great decision maker, so he’s going to make the right read. We really have a lot of trust in him. We just want him to continue to be confident in his game, want him to shoot some more threes, which is getting better over the years. And yeah, just to be the leader on both ends of the floor, especially defensively. Hopefully he’s All-NBA or Defensive Player of the Year this year, which he’s super capable of, and especially him and JA back there, it’s really tough to get anything at the rim.” The grind of the NBA regular season is impossible to avoid, but the Cavs have found an early comfort in leaning on their depth. At the top, they can play to the hot hand among their stars, but they’re finding an ability to be more adaptable as a roster to change their approach and lineups as needed based on matchups and game flow. With Mobley and Allen, they’ve always been able to go big, but against Brooklyn on Saturday, they closed with a four-guard lineup and showed how they can succeed going small, with Caris LeVert and Ty Jerome stepping in and playing well to close out their 11th win to start the season. As Garland explains, their experiences together, the highs and the lows, have taught them a lot about how they need to play, particularly in late game situations where slowing down and getting stagnant to let one player operate can be tempting, but ultimately plays into the hands of the defense.  “We have so much talent on this team and a lot of depth, so we just have a lot of confidence in everybody, and we’ve been in these situations before. Like I said, we’ve been around each other for a couple years now, so we know what to do. We’ve seen all different scenarios, from being in regular season or the playoffs, so when it’s late game situations, I think that we’re starting to get pretty good at it. And even with our depth last night, Ty Jerome and Caris, they ended the game with us. And, I mean, they made a difference when we went four guards and Evan at the five. It’s just so many different things that we can do because of because of our depth. And we got so much talent. I mean, you really have to just pick and poison, either you’re gonna give up a wide open three or a layup or a floater or something.” Garland and the Cavs know there are no banners to be hung for a fast start to the season, but for a team that just never seemed to hit their stride a year ago, this stretch is a reminder to both themselves and the rest of the league that they do have the kind of ceiling where they can beat anyone. There are still 71 games left in the season, but building the confidence and trust internally early on figures to pay dividends down the road.  For now, the Cavs will look to prolong their winning streak as long as they can, but as Garland notes, they have “bigger plans in May and June” and hope to keep putting smiles on faces in Cleveland deep into the spring."

	Barrett did a literal double-take and couldn't stop from blurting out ""Game of Thrones!""","There is no team that has more celebrities attend their games than the Lakers (the Knicks being a close second), as the courtside seats at L.A. games often go a few rows deep with stars from the world of entertainment. There are the regulars like Jack Nicholson and Denzel Washington, but on any given night you might find an actor from your favorite TV show or movie watching the Lakers play.  That happened to Toronto wing RJ Barrett on Sunday night as the Raptors made their annual trek to Los Angeles. After finishing through contact for an and-1, Barrett turned to the crowd in the corner to celebrate only to find himself face-to-face with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, best known for playing Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones. Barrett realized this mid-celebration and did a literal double take, turned back to Coster-Waldau, pointed, and blurted out “Game of Thrones!” at him before turning around and walking to the free throw line.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  It’s a very funny thing to happen in the middle of an NBA game, but also, that’s exactly how I would react if I turned around and was suddenly face-to-face with the guy that played Jaime Lannister. I feel like this is far from the first time someone has pointed at Coster-Waldau and just yelled “Game of Thrones!” at him, as that is by far the role he’s best known for."

	We caught up with Liv Morgan after she made history as the first Women's Crown Jewel Champion.","Before kicking off the Liv Morgan World Tour, and before becoming the first Women’s Crown Jewel Champion, the current Women’s World Champion sat at home nursing a dislocated shoulder. As Liv Morgan recovered for six months throughout 2023, she says she had a moment of clarity.  Over the first decade of her career, she’d allowed her ring work to speak for itself. During her time away, Morgan took a step back and felt like she had lacked a true voice or character. As she plotted her return to the ring, she created the Liv Morgan Revenge Tour built around the realities of her injury, while envisioning a path back to the top of the WWE mountain.  “The Liv Morgan Revenge Tour,” Morgan tells Uproxx Sports, “gave me such a purpose.” Some of the best stories in professional wrestling have been at least somewhat based in reality, and the way Morgan was injured gave her a motive, direction, and something so personal and true, that it allowed her for the first time in her career to really sink her teeth into a story. “Rhea (Ripley) really did dislocate my shoulder,” Morgan says. “I really sat home for six months watching her ascend to the top of the division. And so it was all really personal to me, and I used all that to come back and do exactly to her what she did to me. But I did that and more.” While she’s navigated trying to find her character throughout a decade in WWE, elements of who Morgan is as a person have helped her continue to chip away at this dream. Her drive, passion, wanting to learn as much as she can, and desire to give herself an opportunity to see what she could achieve has brought her this far.  “(My time away) just gave me the time and space that I needed to really settle into my own, which brought out the best version of Liv Morgan than we’ve seen thus far,” Morgan says.  The last seven months have been a whirlwind for Morgan. She kicked off the Raw after WrestleMania 40 with a beatdown of Ripley that would alter the trajectory of her career. A legitimate shoulder injury suffered in the melee forced Ripley to relinquish the title and led to Morgan beating Becky Lynch for the belt. That win kickstarted the pivotal run of her career, with new twists and turns added by the month.  “I like to believe that everything happens for a reason. Even if you don’t know the reason, I know that’s so cliche, but I really live my life by that. And so even when things happen that I feel are bizarre or even unfortunate things, I always tend to think that on the other side of it, it is going to be for a greater purpose,” Morgan says.  “There’s so much beauty in the madness and it’s cool to be able to pivot and adjust when things aren’t going the way we anticipated it, because we took something that was supposed to be great and we made it even greater. And so I just think that the stars are aligned and everything is happening exactly as it should.” Morgan has embraced the “crazy, messy love triangle” that’s followed her dynamic with Dominik Mysterio and Ripley, “whether they love to hate us or hate to love us.” Mysterio switched allegiances, Morgan joined the Judgement Day while Ripley was ousted, Raquel Rodriguez returned to join her side, and Ripley recently suffered another injury that will sideline her for the foreseeable future. Paired alongside Mysterio and thus far able to hold off Ripley, Morgan isn’t just matching the status quo for a world champion — she’s literally doing things that haven’t been done before.  The latest in her evolution from charting a Revenge Tour to creating a Liv Morgan World Tour came with a championship-worthy diamond ring, after claiming the first-ever Women’s Crown Jewel Championship in a win over Nia Jax last week.  “It means so much to me on so many different levels,” Morgan continues. “We’ve made history in Saudi Arabia. We had the very first women’s title match for the Women’s Crown Jewel Championship. And that is so much progress. I feel like since I’ve started in WWE, all I’ve wanted to do is really carve my own path and see how great I could become. And the fact that I’ve made history and the first and only Women’s Crown Jewel Champion, I am just so proud and so honored. And I just hope that I do it justice.” The opportunities are endless for where Morgan goes from here. She’s open to the idea of a second Evolution all-women’s wrestling show, with a loaded roster across Raw, Smackdown, and NXT.  “I don’t think we need our own show to be more prestigious,” Morgan says. “I think we are prestigious and I think people tune in specifically for the women’s segments and for women’s wrestling. But to give the fans what they want is why I would love to have another all women’s show in Evolution part 2.” A WrestleMania main event is something that’s eluded Morgan across her career, but calls it the pinnacle of wrestling in WWE and is without a doubt an accomplishment she’d love to check off her bucket list. “You can’t get any bigger, higher, better, more prestigious than main eventing WrestleMania,” Morgan says. “I spend a lot of my life dreaming and hoping and wishing. And I’ve been fortunate and lucky and blessed enough to have a lot of those things come true. So yes, main eventing WrestleMania is definitely on my list. With whom, I don’t know what that looks like or what it is but I hope that we can find out together.” Morgan can accomplish just about anything because at this very moment she genuinely has the faith and belief that she can. As she continues to build upon her second world title run, the Liv Morgan we see onscreen every week couldn’t be any more different than the one that was Smackdown Champion two years ago.  “It’s just a different Liv Morgan. The Liv Morgan that won the SmackDown Championship from Ronda Rousey, that girl she was just happy to be there. She maybe didn’t even see herself or believe in herself as a champion yet. She was a girl with just a pipe dream, cash in her briefcase at the right moment in the right time,” Morgan says. “This Liv Morgan is the most confident version of herself so far. This Liv Morgan knows her worth. This Liv Morgan knows she’s the greatest women’s champion of all time. This Liv Morgan knows she’s untouchable. This Liv Morgan knows she has the most dominant faction in all of WWE by her side. That’s the difference.”"

	Holmgren fell hard on his right hip after contesting a shot and had to be helped off the floor without putting weight on his right leg.","The Oklahoma City Thunder entered Sunday tied with the Suns for the top spot in the Western Conference, and figured to face a stiff test with the red-hot Golden State Warriors in town. OKC got off to a strong start, taking a 33-26 lead after the first quarter, but there was some considerable concern about their star big man as Chet Holmgren had to be helped off the floor and into the locker room after landing hard on his right hip after contesting an Andrew Wiggins layup attempt at the rim (watch here).  Holmgren slams down onto the hardwood and immediately grabbed at his right hip in pain. He was ultimately helped off the floor and into the tunnel without putting any weight on his right leg by a pair of Thunder staffers. Holmgren has gotten off to a tremendous start to his sophomore campaign, averaging 18.2 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.9 blocks per game coming into Sunday’s contest, asserting himself as a serious threat for DPOY with his work protecting the rim for the league’s best defense so far.  The Thunder will hope Holmgren’s injury was just a painful fall and not something more serious that could lead to an extended absence, as they are already incredibly thin at the center position with Isaiah Hartenstein still out with a fractured hand.  UPDATE: Holmgren was ruled out for the game with what the Thunder officially called a right hip injury. Shams Charania reported later Monday night that Holmgren would miss 8-10 weeks with a hip fracture."

	Giannis played a little prank on Jaylen Brown after catching him with an elbow, but the Celtics star wasn't a big fan of Giannis' antics.","The Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics have had two very different starts to the season, as the defending champs have picked up where they left off with another strong beginning to their repeat bid, while the Bucks have been one of the NBA’s worst teams despite having a healthy Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo.  It has not been the kind of start Milwaukee envisioned, and they were hoping to kickstart a turnaround on Sunday when they played host to the Celtics with a chance to alleviate some of the panic about the team’s start by beating one of the league’s best. As they’ve done on a few occasions this season, the Bucks came out hot, scoring 40 in the first quarter to take a double-digit lead, but couldn’t maintain that offensive output, scoring just 38 in the entire second half to see the Celtics pull ahead and pull away for a 113-107 win.  During the game, Giannis and Jaylen Brown had an interesting exchange, as Antetokounmpo elbowed Brown in the head on a post move and then hit Brown with a fake handshake as they went back down the court, which Brown didn’t seem to appreciate.   A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston)  After the game, Brown gave some brief, but unfiltered thoughts on the exchange. “Giannis is a child,” Brown dead-panned. “I’m just focused on helping my team get a win, and that’s what we did tonight.”  Giannis certainly wasn’t the chief culprit for the Bucks struggles on Sunday, as he had 43 points and 13 rebounds, but this kind of silly exchange doesn’t quite land as well with fans when the team is falling to 2-8 on the season, with the only team worse than them in the East being the Embiid-less Sixers."

	The Chiefs moved to 9-0 after blocking a 35-yard kick by Denver with one second left that would've won the game.","The Kansas City Chiefs entered Sunday as the NFL’s last remaining undefeated team at 8-0, and were heavy favorites to move to 9-0 at home against their divisional rival from Denver. However, the Chiefs offense, which has been sluggish at times this season, could not finish off drives with touchdowns and allowed the Broncos to hang around all game.  On Sunday, it looked like that would finally catch up to them and result in a loss, as the Broncos moved the ball inside the Chiefs 20 on their final drive of the game, trailing 16-14, setting up a 35-yard field goal attempt for the win by Wil Lutz. However, the Chiefs special teams unit still had at least one more miracle in them, as George Karlaftis, Leo Chenal, and company caved in the left side of the Broncos field goal unit and blocked the kick to preserve the 16-14 win.  A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  It’s an insane way for the Chiefs to win that game, as they were completely unable to run the ball (19 carries for 57 yards, 19 yards coming from Patrick Mahomes scrambling), missed a number of big play opportunities and had to settle for field goals, and gave up a critical late game drive deep into their own territory. And yet, they move on to Week 11 at 9-0 on the season with a schedule that isn’t the most difficult if they can get past a road trip to Buffalo next week — although, as Sunday proved, division games can always get weird."
Sports – UPROXX,The Bucks Have ‘Called The Whole League’ Trying To Find A Trade After Their Awful Start,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/milwaukee-bucks-trade-rumors-called-whole-league/,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 22:30:53 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	The Bucks are trying to find a roster upgrade, but with their cap situation, they're finding it nearly impossible despite their best effort.","The Milwaukee Bucks came into the 2024-25 season hopeful that having both Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo fully healthy and coming off a full training camp together would vault them back into being a threat in the Eastern Conference. Instead, the Bucks are 2-6 with their only wins over the tanking Jazz and the Sixers on opening night — who were without Joel Embiid and Paul George and have also looked awful to start the season.  It’s been rough on both sides of the ball for the Bucks, as they are in the bottom half of the league in both offensive and defensive rating through the first few weeks of the season, and while things should improve if and when Khris Middleton can get back healthy for an extended period of time, it’s also pretty clear this roster has some flaws in need of fixing. The problem for the Bucks is, as a second apron team, making a trade is extremely difficult, as they’ve found out the hard way recently.  On Friday’s episode of NBA Today, Brian Windhorst said the Bucks have “called pretty much the whole league” trying to find a trade that could improve their roster, but have run into the same issues with just about everyone.  “The Bucks are doing something that we don’t see very often, which is scouring the trade market in the first week of November,” Windhorst said. “As I was talking to teams this week, they were like, ‘The Bucks just called. The Bucks just called.’ I think the Bucks right now are just kind of searching and trying to cover their bases. And by the way, Giannis is not on the table, Dame is not on the table, they’re looking to try and (find) help for some of their wing play — Khris Middleton’s absence has been extended.  “I talked to one team who said, ‘Yeah, we talked to the Bucks. We came up with two or three different scenarios and realized we’re not allowed to make any of those trades.’ The Bucks are hemmed in as a second-apron team with the new rules. They can’t aggregate players together, they can’t put like two or three players together in a trade. They can’t do a trade where they bring in more money. They have traded away the next six first round picks, either the picks or the swaps, they have traded away the next six second round picks. They are $75 million in the luxury tax. I don’t think help is on the way through the trade market. But they are making calls, which is interesting because from what I can tell, they called pretty much the whole league.” The two players the Bucks were reported to be shopping over the summer (and even last trade deadline) were Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton, but as Windhorst notes, being unable to aggregate those salaries together means they have to find a player to trade for that matches salary exactly or makes just a little less than either of those two. Given Portis makes just over $12.5 million and Connaughton makes just under $9.5 million, that’s a tough thing to do if the goal is to add a strong contributor for a contender. As such, Windy doesn’t expect them to find a miraculous deal out there, and it sounds like, despite the front office’s best efforts in working the phones, it’s going to come down to this roster to turn things around in Milwaukee."

	Come get these winners.","More than half of the 2024 NFL regular season is over. That reality is painful for those enjoy consuming every aspect of professional football and, in this space, things haven’t gone particularly well. In fact, it was largely a disaster for the first seven weeks but, after back-to-back winning performances, optimism is beginning to creep in.  Would it have been better if the Cleveland Browns or Green Bay Packers could’ve taken care of business last week? Certainly. But here we are after a 3-2 showing. Before handing out this week’s selections, let’s take stock as we dig out of the hole.  Come get these winners. I am actually quite high on the Bills dating back to the summer, but I can’t get them to -4 here. Buffalo is riding high with a four-game winning streak, which helps to explain the number, and Indianapolis has flopped with two straight losses. Still, Joe Flacco and company shouldn’t be getting a full four at home, and we have to take the candy. This is just a principle play. We’re taking advantage of a Wong teaser here, sending Pittsburgh through a pair of key numbers and doing the same with Kansas City. The Steelers have been a wagon as an underdog under Mike Tomlin. The Chiefs will eventually lose (I think) but it won’t be here.  As noted a week ago, this credit goes to UPROXX editor Robby Kalland, but NFC South overs are unbeaten this season. Perhaps that will come to an end here, but Atlanta’s offense can put up points in bunches and its defense is capable of letting the Saints hang around. Let’s go touchdowns. I have to admit that I hate this. I know my editors will hate this. But Los Angeles is laying more than a touchdown with a total in the 30’s? It isn’t as if the Chargers have a real home-field advantage either. I’m holding my nose as I type this, but I simply must. New York has been a sharp side all week, and that makes sense. I couldn’t quite give out the Jets in an awesome spot last week, but I think this is a sell-high spot on Arizona after their blowout win over Chicago. Take me there, Aaron Rodgers."

	The new release from ""A Philly Special Christmas Party"" features an unlikely duet between the Hall of Fame center and the legendary singer.","Jason Kelce clearly has some pretty major aspirations for this year’s version of his annual Christmas album. Earlier this month, fans of Kelce’s holiday project with his former Philadelphia Eagles teammates Lane Johnson and Jordan Mailata heard the first track off of their upcoming album A Philly Special Christmas Party, which featured Kelce teaming up with his brother, Travis Kelce, and Boyz II Men on the track “It’s Christmas Time (In Cleveland Heights).” Kelce collaborated with another legendary artist for the latest track off of the upcoming release, as he recorded a duet with Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks. The track, a cover of Ron Sexsmith’s “Maybe This Christmas,” got teased on the project’s Instagram account over the last week and on the latest edition of the Kelce brothers’ podcast, and was officially unveiled on Friday.  A post shared by A Philly Special Christmas (@aphillyspecialchristmas)  “There are no words to describe how incredible it is to have Stevie Nicks on this record,” executive producer Conner Barwin said in a statement given to Rolling Stone. “There is so much emotion in this song, and it was thrilling to be with them in the studio and watch her and Jason connect, be creative together, and witness this beautiful song become a reality.” A Philly Special Christmas Party will come out on Nov. 22, 2024, but if you’d like to listen to the new track, you can do that right here."

	NBA players have been appearing in music videos for years, and today, we highlighted some of the best cameos.","NBA players and musical artists have always been close with one another. One frequent way that we’ve seen that over the years is music videos, as NBA players have frequently made cameos in them, whether they’re just showing their face for a moment or they’re a main character in the story that an artist is trying to tell. Today, we wanted to highlight some of our favorite appearances that NBA players have made in music videos over the years. Players from a number of different eras — and songs from a number of different genres — made it on the list, but all of them feature artists making it a point to get some of the biggest names in basketball into their videos. This wasn’t the only time Kobe linked up with Destiny’s Child — he recorded a verse on a remix of their track “Say My Name.” He does have a cameo in the video for “Bug-a-Boo,” though, as Destiny’s Child — which is trying to get away from a group that is bugging them — dips into a locker room. While going through there, they come across Bryant, who is sitting there and getting ready to play basketball. MJ and MJ just had to appear in a music video together at some point, no? The two appear on a basketball court and shoot hoops with one another, and at one point, Michael (Jackson) teaches Michael (Jordan) some dance moves. These might have been the two most famous people in the world when this video came out in 1992, and it’s a pretty remarkable cultural artifact. The newest release on this list, DeRozan was one of the many celebrities who made a cameo in Lamar’s summer anthem that doubled as the high point of his feud with Drake from earlier this year. It turns out DeRozan has known Lamar for quite some time, and while he said he still has love for Drake despite appearing in this video, well, it sure seems like there might be some tension here. Shaq, as we’ve laid out before, has been in a ton of music videos over the years. His first was the iconic “Make ‘Em Say Uhh!” video, where he sits courtside and looks like he’s having the time of his life as Master P and co. put on a show on the hardwood. One of the biggest music videos of all time — it’s a little more than 14 and a half minutes long, and is absolutely jam packed with some of the biggest names in sports and entertainment at that time. Names like Deion Sanders, Rickey Henderson, and Wayne Gretzky make cameos, while the NBA is well-represented with two members of the Dream Team and, uh, a third player who was almost on the Dream Team. Easily the most … unique video on this list. It features Jimmy Butler dressed up in what I can only describe as an emo cowboy costume and really committing fully to the bit. (The bit, of course, is “Jimmy Butler dressing like this in a Fall Out Boy video.”) There is no one in the NBA quite like Jimmy, and this video is a pretty good example of why that is the case."

	Travis Kelce caught a stray on 'Jeopardy!.'","Travis Kelce has long been one of the NFL’s most visible stars, but recently, he has achieved a new level of widespread cultural notoriety thanks to his relationship with Taylor Swift. Jeopardy! made a nod to that during the November 6 episode. In the episode’s opening round (per J! Archive), the $200 clue in the “The TV Show In Question” category read, “Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? is hosted by this man who’s maybe more famous as a BF than as a 3-time Super Bowl champ.” Contestant Derek Hieronymus correctly responded with Kelce. Here’s a video of the moment. This came shortly after Jeopardy! found itself in a bit of hot water. As USA Today notes, Heather Ryan, a contestant on the October 28 episode, recently spoke out about a clue that read, “Men seldom make passes at…,” with the correct response being, “Girls who wear glasses.” She said, “It is definitely an odd choice. I think it made everybody in the audience and on stage — and Ken Jennings, too — a little uncomfortable. It was like, ‘Oh, that was unexpected.’ Maybe we choose better rhyming phrases in 2024. […] Unfortunately, there are still girls who are (in) middle school, and they don’t want to wear their glasses and they’re losing out on their education. So, I think it’s much better to be able to see than anything else.” Jennings apologized following the incident, saying, “A little problematic, sorry Heather.”"

	Vivek Ranadive has unsurprisingly taken DeMar DeRozan's side in his simmering feud with Drake.","The Toronto Raptors traveled to Sacramento to take on the Kings on Wednesday night in a game that has suddenly given us a little spiciness off the court. Sacramento went to Toronto on the night of Vince Carter’s jersey retirement ceremony last week, which was the first time that DeMar DeRozan played in front of Drake since he appeared in the music video for Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us.” While DeRozan, in the immediate aftermath, said he has tons of love for Drake despite his cameo in the video, Drake expressed that he doesn’t want to see DeRozan get his number retired in Toronto when his career comes to an end, and DeRozan seemed to have a lot of fun responding. And on Wednesday with Drake’s beloved Raptors in town, Kings owner Vivek Ranadive decided to show some support to his star forward by wearing a shirt with the words “THEY NOT LIKE US” on it.  A post shared by SLAM (@slam)  The Kings picked up a 122-107 win on Wednesday to move and 5-3 on the season. All five starters scored in double-figures for Sacramento, with DeRozan leading the way with 27 points on 11-for-21 shooting. It is unclear if he was motivated by the fact that the team’s owner showed up and wore a shirt that trolled Drake, but I’m sure at least part of him appreciated it."

	Windhorst thinks the Warriors have an ""itchy trigger finger"" when it comes to trade talks and chasing another star.","The Golden State Warriors picked up a big early season win on Wednesday night when they defeated the Boston Celtics to improve to 7-1 on the young season and offer an early confirmation point that their hot start is the real deal after beating a number of teams in the middle and bottom of the standings.  The Warriors’ depth has been showcased during their hot start, but this is a team that was very active on the trade market this summer trying to land another star-level player to fit between Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. Paul George and Lauri Markkanen were well known pursuits of the Warriors, and their hot start may only further embolden the front office to go star-chasing during the season.  As Brian Windhorst laid out on Thursday’s First Take, the Warriors are the team he most expects to make a splash trade this season, as they have the contracts, young players, and draft assets to make a competitive offer for just about anyone.  ""The Warriors are the biggest candidate in my mind to make a big trade. They tried to trade for LeBron James last trade deadline… This is a team that's got an itchy trigger finger trying to make a big deal."" – Brian Windhorst 👀pic.twitter.com/0wYql9bYW4 — ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) November 7, 2024  Windhorst notes this front office seems to have an “itchy trigger finger” when it comes to trade talks, noting their efforts at landing another star date back to last deadline when they called the Lakers about LeBron. While a move isn’t imminent and they’ll likely ride this wave of positivity for awhile, by the time 2025 arrives and trade season kicks into full gear, they should be seen as a top threat for any star that comes available. We know the likes of Brandon Ingram and Zach LaVine are still available, but that was the case this summer and the Warriors seemed to balk at making a move for either of those two players. Instead, it seems Golden State is keen to wait to see if someone else comes available they could make a run at, but Windy, at the very least, would be very surprised if this Warriors roster looks the same by mid-February when San Francisco is hosting the All-Star Game."

	We caught up with Mercedes Moné to discuss her return from injury, regaining confidence, and how she's blazing a trail for the AEW women.","The last year has been a whirlwind for Mercedes Moné, and more than six months into her AEW tenure, there’s plenty to be grateful for.  What was once considered a career-ending ankle injury could have sidelined Moné for good, she refused to accept the possibility of her childhood dream being over, instead choosing optimism, and willing herself back into the ring. “It’s really just leading with gratitude, thankful to be a part of this wrestling community still,” Moné tells Uproxx Sports. “The last year was the craziest year of my whole life, not knowing where I was going to be in wrestling, but leading with gratitude and staying positive.” Moné landed in AEW in March, carrying the same mindset she’s had throughout her career as she’s trail blazed a new path for women’s wrestling.  “(I knew) where I wanted to be and what I want to leave in professional wrestling, to take this women’s division to whole new heights all over the world,” Moné says. “I wanted to have more for women’s wrestling, so I knew going to AEW was the place to be to make that happen. I feel like the women’s division has really changed the game. The women’s division has been the best it’s ever been. The women’s storylines are headlining AEW pay-per-views. So it’s just been amazing to come this far and I’m really excited for more.” For most athletes, an injury the severity of Moné’s typically requires at least two years to be back at full strength. She says she feels amazing being back in the ring and admits the toughest part of this journey is in the past.  “For me, it was just mentally going into the ring and training and being like, okay, I don’t want to be scared of climbing the top rope. I don’t want to be scared of jumping off the top rope. I don’t even want to be scared of running, because due to my injury, I couldn’t walk for over three months,” Moné says. “So just telling myself that I still got this. I got to train with Tyler Breeze for three months preparing myself for my AEW debut. And it was just getting my confidence back in the ring. That’s what really took some time. But now I’m feeling better than ever, and here I am as two belts Moné, so I’m feeling great.” After returning to the ring in May, Moné was quick to find gold around her waist. She defeated Willow Nightingale to earn the TBS title before claiming the NJPW STRONG Women’s championship just a month later. After sitting in the stands at All In at Wembley Stadium last year, Moné battled Britt Baker in London this year. She’s continued to find her footing in matches against Hikaru Shida, Emi Sakura, and most recently, Queen Aminata.  Moné isn’t just talking the talk, she’s leading the AEW women’s division to new heights and opening doors to elevate talent across the roster.  “I was born to be the best. I was born to have this purpose of leading a charge of making sure that women’s wrestling is known and respected and it deserves the respect that it’s given,” Moné says. “So just leaning on the standard that I put for myself, I’m here to be the best, to show the world that I’m the best, and I’m here to bring the women along with me. So that’s the goal.” While she has her eyes firmly on her next challenger for the TBS championship, Kris Statlander at the Full Gear pay-per-view on November 23, Moné isn’t stopping at defending the belts already in her possession. Mariah May told me ahead of All In earlier this year that she’s interested in mixing it up down the line with Moné, a dream opponent for the talented AEW Women’s champion. When — and if — that match happens remains to be seen.  Moné is never one to shy away from a challenge and says she’s “coming for all the titles” in AEW, while offering praise for one of the promotion’s brightest young talents. “I am super proud to watch from afar. She came in as a super fan, just loving wrestling, loved it so much that she moved from England to Japan, trained out in Stardom just to hone her craft, and now she’s here,” Moné says.   “She is our women’s world champion, beating Toni Storm in one of the best storylines in women’s history. So to see her rise this fast and to see how good she is in the ring, it’s so incredible. Like I said, we have the best women’s division in the game right now. And I’m definitely looking at the title that she has around her waist.”"

He eventually landed on his dad’s Los Angeles Lakers squad in the second round of this year’s NBA draft. After just a few games, however, he was sent to play in the NBA’s G League to build up his skills.  
	Upon his arrival, it was reported that Bronny would “shuttle” between both teams during an undisclosed period of time and will only be playing in G League home games, as to not fly commercial with his South Bay Lakers teammates. It is also reported that Bronny would be skipping road games due to the team staying at affordable hotels like the Courtyard-Marriott, rubbing many, including former NFL star and podcaster Ryan Clark, the wrong way.

	








 
	On his The Pivot podcast, Clark shared his confusion over Bronny’s ability to skip games due to travel and lodging accommodations when he hasn’t earned his stripes as an athlete just yet.

	“What has Bronny James done that he shouldn’t be able to stay at the Courtyard-Marriott?,” Clark questioned. “You say, ‘well, they fly commercial.’ What has Bronny James done where he should be too good to fly commercial? The pros isn’t about where you came from, how you were raised, what your parents had. Professional sports is about how well you can contribute, and you don’t get treated differently because of your parents.” A post shared by The Neighborhood Talk (@theneighborhoodtalk) 
	Many agree with Clark, including ESPN reporter Brian Windhorst, who believes coddling Bronny now will be “detrimental” to his career, adding that he believes the special treatment the former USC student receives from the Lakers has gone “too far,” The Post reports.   
	Another ESPN insider, however, is arguing that the Lakers are treating Bronny differently because, well, he’s different.  
	“Bronny James isn’t just your normal, everyday G League player,” ESPN’s Shams Charania said on The Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday. 
	“I don’t know if it’s a security thing, but there’s a different level of fanfare when he’s on the road for these G League games, a different level of everything when he’s with that G League team. How do you manage that on the road? I don’t think the door is necessarily completely shut on him playing in those road games as the G League season goes on, but as of right now that is the plan that the Lakers have laid out, and they want him to continue to shuttle back and forth, spend as much time on the active roster as possible.”

The fight ended up being highly underwhelming for many, and Michael Irvin recently shared his belief that most likely was not an accident. 
	“That fight was a lie,” he said during an appearance on Cam’ron and Ma$e’s popular sports talk show It Is What It Is. He continued, citing how both boxers didn’t seem to be putting in 100% effort and Iron Mike did not utilize a special move in his arsenal. “Everybody’s lying […] they had no intentions to really strap it on. If you look through that, I didn’t see one patented uppercut by Mike Tyson. What did Mike Tyson win on? Uppercut.”

	








 
	The NFL Hall Of Famer revealed rumors he heard that could explain why the fight wasn’t as exciting as it was promoted to be. “I heard some people talking about they couldn’t put [Mike Tyson’s uppercut] in the contract,” he stated. “He couldn’t body and then uppercut. Like, how can you put that in a fight contract?”

	Michael Irvin continued his assessment of the fight and rumored contrast terms by drawing a parallel to his NFL career. “That’s like making me play a game without running a slant route in the deep end or the deep out,” he said. “You do what you do best. If they take that away, you ain’t that dude anymore, and they took that away.” 
DJ Whoo Kid supported Irvin’s claims when he recounted a conversation he had with Jake Paul at a fight after-party, saying, “Legally they each cannot go at each other hard.” Despite being disappointed by how the boxing match went, the former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver was happy to see Mike Tyson secure a large payday. “I’m happy he got every dime, or whatever it is,” he said. “I want him to get his money. I just wanted him to free the beast.” 
	Per the final tally of the fight, Tyson threw 97 punches and only landed 18. Paul threw 278 punches and landed 78. Iron Mike was paid $20 million and Paul got $40 million. One valid explanation for the underwhelming bout is the health issues Tyson dealt with in the lead-up, which made them postpone the match as it was originally booked for July. He suffered from an ulcer flare-up and revealed that he almost died in June. 

	








 
	“This is one of those situations when you lost but still won,” Mike Tyson wrote on X. “I’m grateful for last night. No regrets to get in ring one last time. I almost died in June. Had 8 blood transfusions. Lost half my blood and 25lbs in hospital and had to fight to get healthy to fight so I won. To have my children see me stand toe to toe and finish 8 rounds with a talented fighter half my age in front of a packed Dallas Cowboy stadium is an experience that no man has the right to ask for. Thank you.” 
	“I wanted to give the fans a show, but I didn’t want hurt someone who didn’t need to be hurt,” Jake Paul said of the match. “I didn’t wanna hurt someone that didn’t need to be hurt.”  Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"

Sports,Bobby Portis Offers $40K Reward For “Prized Possessions” Stolen In Burglary,https://www.vibe.com/news/sports/bobby-portis-reward-prized-possesions-stolen-burglary-1234950302/,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:15:11 +0000",Portis is the latest professional athlete to fall victim to a home invasion.,"NBA star Bobby Portis is offering a hefty reward for information leading to the recovery of “prized possessions” that were stolen during a burglary at his Wisconson home.  
	On Nov. 6, Portis, the Milwaukee Bucks forward released a public message via Instagram pleading for the public’s assistance in locating the stolen items, which he’s willing to pay $40,000 cash for. In the video, Portis spoke of his love for the city of Milwaukee, where he became a resident after signing a deal with the Bucks organization in 2020. 
	“Over the last four-and-a-half seasons, I’ve considered Milwaukee as a home,” Portis, 29, said. “I’ve grown here, I come here a boy and elevated into a man. The love you guys have given me here isn’t something I’ve ever felt before in my NBA career.”

	








 
	He continued, explaining the circumstances behind the burglary, which occurred while Portis was out of town for the Bucks’ matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers earlier this month.

	“While I was at the game yesterday, we had a home invasion and they took most of my prized possessions,” Portis added, expressing the importance that the items, which he did not specify, hold to him and his family. 
	The burglary of Portis’ home marks the latest in a string of home invasions seemingly targeting professional athletes that have occurred in recent months. 
	In September, Minnesota Timberwolves guard Mike Conley’s Minnesota home was broken into and ransacked, with jewelry being listed among the items stolen. Authorities believe the burglary of Portis and Conley’s homes could possibly be connected due to similarities in the two break-ins, despite occurring in neighboring states. 
	NFL stars and reigning Super Bowl champions Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce’s homes were also burglarized in October, within a 48-hour period of one another. While no items were reported as stolen from Mahomes’ residence, the culprits in the burglary of Kelce’s home made off with $20,000 after breaking into the property through a rear door.

	








 
	Drafted in the first round of the 2015 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls, Portis has spent time with Bulls, Washington Wizards, and New York Knicks before joining the Bucks, winning a championship with the team in 2021.

	Netflix had its first live boxing event on Friday night (Nov. 15) with a card headlined by the Jake Paul, 27, and Mike Tyson, 58—the widest age disparity in sanctioned boxing history. And the generation divide wasn’t the only stark distinction between the two men. 
	Jake Paul came out to to the ring to Phil Collins’ “In The Air Tonight,” riding in a customized low-rider with his brother Logan Paul. The entrance was jam-packed with thinly veiled jabs at Tyson, with the song referencing the boxer’s appearance in The Hangover, and even a bird, referencing the “Now Kith” meme. Tyson, however, walked out to the ring with pure intention of throwing down and nothing more. And all the built-up tension was released as the two combatants entered the ring for the highly-anticipated showdown. 
	While both Tyson and Paul promised to knock the other boxer out before the 5th round, the match surprisingly went for the entire eight rounds. Tyson came out swinging for the first two rounds but Father Time quickly got Iron Mike together, as the icon began to slow down with each subsequent round. Paul kept to a moderate pace throughout the whole match.

	Jake Paul’s even-keeled strategy allowed him to drastically out-punch Tyson throughout the match. By round four, Tyson’s legs looked tired and shaky, which were tell-tale signs of exhaustion for a boxer. 
	As the fight ended in round 8, Jake Paul began bowing to Mike Tyson out of respect for “being an all-time great in this sport” and for “all that he’s done to allow us to be here.” Tyson kept his guard up but gave Paul some dap as he realized the fight was over. In what played out like more of a sparring match than a headlined main attraction, judges declared that Paul was the winner in a unanimous decision. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"

Kiyan Anthony, Carmelo Anthony‘s son, has made his college decision, and he’s committing to Syracuse University. The young basketball player appeared on Melo’s 7PM in Brooklyn podcast alongside his dad and his mother, La La Anthony, where he broke the news himself. Kiyan had been stewing over his final schools, consisting of USC and Auburn, but felt like ‘Cuse was where he needed to be. 
	Kiyan explained to everyone that what he loved the most about playing for ‘Cuse outside of the connection to his dad were marquee match-ups against universities like Duke and North Carolina. Anthony expressed that the national spotlight would benefit both him and the rest of his teammates who are looking to restore Syracuse to greatness and possible futures in the NBA. “All that played a part into why I chose Syracuse,” Kiyan said on the podcast. 
	“I’m overwhelmed,” La La said following her son’s announcement during the podcast. “I’m happy because he’s happy…It’s big shoes to fill, but at the same time, this is his moment, his lane and his time to create his own reality.”

	Kiyan Anthony also talked to ESPN about his decision, saying, “Ultimately, it came down to my relationship with the staff. From day one, when they started recruiting me, they made me feel like it was family. My dad’s name on the facility is special, but I want to go in there and create my own name, and I’ve already done that through my dedication in the offseason, with early-morning practices, playing at camps, playing on the circuit.” 
	Kiy then spoke about the culture that Coach Adrian Autry is trying to establish with the Orangemen basketball unit. Anthony expressed to the outlet that Autry, who was named the head coach after the 2022-23 season, had already begun getting to work on the 2025 season. 
	“I’m going to do everything Coach Autry needs me to do,” Anthony added. “We talk a lot, especially late at night, about how we can make Syracuse basketball great. Off the court, Coach is super cool. You could go out with him on a Friday night. He’s still young and connects with all his players; he is very relatable.” 
	While Carmelo Anthony only played one season for the Orangemen, his impact on the university is undeniable. 
	During his lone 2003 season, Melo, a freshman, led the Orangemen to a storybook national championship. His performance was one for the ages, with the Brooklyn native being named both an All-American and the NCAA Final Four’s Most Outstanding Player. Kiyan understands the pressure, but wants to carve out his own page in the NCAA history books.

Thursday (Nov. 14) found the two men doing their final weigh-in and stare down ahead of their Netflix exhibition. Tyson weighed in at 233 pounds and promptly took his spot on stage. Paul was clocked at 220 pounds, a career-high for him, and then began his usual antics. Hitting the stage in a crawling stance, Jake Paul then immediately began running toward Iron Mike, getting directly in his face. 
ESPN reports that around this time, the YouTuber “purposefully” stepped on Tyson’s foot, to which he responded by slapping him in the face. A source close to the event claimed that Mike Tyson had grown “tired” of the content creator’s trash talk in the days leading up to Thursday. So, Paul stepping on the OG’s foot finally set him over the top, resulting in him slapping his opponent. “[Mike Tyson] hits like a bi**h! It’s personal now. He must die!” Paul dramatically screamed to the crowd while Tyson walked away from the stage.

	The slap marks a shift in Mike Tyson’s behavior towards Paul. Throughout the event’s rollout, Tyson and Paul have played it fast and loose, keeping the banter semi-playful while throwing in a couple of laughs and jabs here and there. However, as the day of the fight quickly approached, Tyson transformed into something far more intense. On Tuesday (Nov. 12), the boxing legend talked to reporters about the fight, promising to unleash “the devil himself” on Friday night. 
	“I’m bringing the devil himself [to the ring],” Tyson told ESPN. “There are no feelings attached. My own mother should be very careful if she has to get in the ring with me.

Sports,"Carmelo Anthony, Rudy Gay Chime In On Drake-DeMar DeRozan Feud",https://www.vibe.com/news/sports/carmelo-anthony-rudy-gay-drake-demar-derozan-feud-1234943651/,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:22:01 +0000",The biggest topic of the year and all of its subsidiaries continues to make headlines.,"The intersection of Hip-Hop and sports means twice as many people chiming in on topics involving artists and athletes. Former NBA stars Carmelo Anthony and Rudy Gay recently chimed in on the recent back and forth between Drake and DeMar DeRozan, which was a byproduct of the 6 God’s feud with Kendrick Lamar earlier this year. 
	“I think Drake was hurt a little bit because of the relationship he built with DeMar in Toronto,” Melo said on an episode of his show 7PM In Brooklyn. “Representing the 6, Raptors — you know that was a lot of connection with those two. He’s a Raptor for life from a basketball standpoint. Yes, that jersey should be going up.” 

	








 
	Gay, who just recently retired from the NBA, previously played for the Raptors, and is a new recurring co-host on 7PM, disapproved of Drizzy’s behavior. “That’s wack, man. Drake is wack for that,” he asserted. “You gotta pull up on DeMar if you feel that way before you go on camera.” Melo agreed, especially regarding the Toronto rapper’s comments on taking down DeRozan’s banner if the Raptors ever hung one up for him.

	“Drake did a lot when he said I’ma go up there and take it down. That part is a lot,” Carmelo Anthony said. However, he acknowledged that DeRozan turned himself into Drake’s opposition when he joined Kendrick Lamar on stage at The Pop Out concert and appeared in the “Not Like Us” music video. “Those are shots. You my man, we in the crib, we hanging, we building the 6 up. From that standpoint, that would f**k me up, too. I’m gonna feel a way no matter what, but yes, you do have a conversation. As a man, you have a conversation.” 
	Though Rudy Gay did not like the “First Person Shooter” rapper’s actions, he leveled with Anthony on that part. “If you got a problem, come at me,” he said. “To see your man’s out there dancing with the enemy, that’s kinda crazy.” 
	Drake and DeMar DeRozan went viral earlier this month when the For All The Dogs rapper sat courtside for the Toronto Raptors matchup against the Sacramento Kings. At one point, he was interviewed on air and said, “Unfortunately, we’re playing this goof [DeRozan] tonight, but it is what it is” as well as “If you ever put up a DeRozan banner, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.”

	








 
	After the Raptors defeated the Kings, Drake could be seen mouthing “F**k outta here pu**y” as DeRozan walked off the court. During a post-game press conference, the six-time All-Star was asked about the comments regarding the banner and said, “Well he gon’ have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck.” 
	This is a significant change in their relationship, just three years after DeRozan said that Drake would “forever have a friend” in him. When he was traded from the Raptors to the Spurs, despite being told he would not be traded, the five-time Grammy winner invited him to his house and gave him support in his time of disappointment. Even after appearing at The Pop Out and in the “Not Like Us” music video, he claimed that he still had love for the OVO head honcho. Those days are seemingly over.

ESPN reports that the rookie NBA player will make his debut with the minor league squad in a Saturday exhibition against Salt Lake City. However, Bronny will be on the Lakers roster for their game on Friday, squaring off against the underperforming Philadelphia 76ers. 
	Sources close to the Lakers state that Bronny will only play for South Bay during their home games. James will then “shuttle” between both teams during an undisclosed period of time. While it may come as a shock to some fans, Lakers head coach JJ Redick explained that this was the plan they had for Bronny “since day one.” 
	Bronny James’ situation isn’t unique to him, either. As he was selected to the Lakers with the 55th pick of the 2024 NBA Draft, it was expected that he would get some burn in the G League. Historically speaking, players selected late in the second tend to spend time in the minor league to get additional coaching, structure in their respective team’s culture, and gain game reps.

	








 A post shared by South Bay Lakers (@southbaylakers) 
	Bronny James has only played in four games this season for the Los Angeles Lakers out of the eight games so far. The Lakers are currently 10th in the Western Conference with their 4-4 record.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. After scoring a goal on Monday, U.S. men's soccer star Christian Pulisic joined the wave of athletes who are pulling out President-elect Trump's ""YMCA"" dance as a celebration. Pulisic told reporters afterward he ""thought it was funny"" and said the dance moves were not ""political"" in nature. But that didn't save him from scrutiny.

(Getty Images/IMAGN) The U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF) did not address Pulisic’s dance, but cut that part of the clip out when reposting the score on its social media accounts. However, anonymous USSF officials expressed dismay to The Athletic on Tuesday. ""Literally nobody here is surprised,"" a USSF employee told the outlet. ""It doesn’t feel that way, at least. But it’s still really disappointing, to say the least."" Another employee added that the organization has ""more pressing things to worry about."" Well, a former member of the United States men's soccer youth program took a shot at the media for ripping Pulisic, posting a story by The Athletic that was headlined, ""Christian Pulisic, the Donald Trump dance and why true leaders consider the impact of their actions.""

But it’s one thing to say you’re a leader and another to do what leaders do: consider how their actions will be perceived by their teammates and others,"" he wrote. ""And yes, that extends to dances — especially when you’re literally mimicking the dance of an elected leader.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Federal judge pushes back on parents calling trans athlete 'a boy' in legal battle over pro-girls protests,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/federal-judge-pushes-back-parents-calling-trans-athlete-a-boy-legal-battle-over-pro-girls-protests,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 17:05:06 -0500",New Hampshire Judge Steven McAuliffe presided over a case involving parents who wore armbands to protest a transgender athlete at a high school girls&apos; soccer game,"Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., details her resolution requiring staffers to use bathrooms corresponding with their biological sex on 'The Ingraham Angle.' New Hampshire Judge Steven McAuliffe presided over a case involving parents in the state who wore pro-girl armbands at a high school girls soccer game that included a transgender athlete. During the case, McAuliffe pushed back on the parents for repeatedly referring to the athlete as a boy.  ""You seem to go out of your way to suggest there’s no such thing as a trans girl,"" McAuliffe said during the hearing.  McAuliffe's federal judicial service dates back to 1992, when he was appointed by former President George H.W. Bush. On Thursday, McAuliffe heard arguments in a case in which plaintiffs Kyle Fellers and Anthony Foote sued the Bow School District after being banned from school grounds for wearing the wristbands at their daughters' soccer game in September.  THE PRONOUN POLICE HAVE ARRIVED AND ARE COMING FOR YOU NEXT  The wristbands said ""XX"" in reference to the natural female chromosomes. The ""XX"" logo has become an unspoken symbol of the ongoing legal and political battle against transgender inclusion in girls and women's sports across the country. Many consider it a women's rights phenomenon.  The no-trespass orders have since expired, but McAuliffe is deciding whether the plaintiffs should be allowed to wear the wristbands and carry signs at upcoming school events, including basketball games, swim meets and a music concert, while the case proceeds. A protester outside the Kansas Statehouse holds a sign after a rally for transgender rights on the Transgender Day of Visibility, March 31, 2023, in Topeka, Kan. (AP Photo/John Hanna) They wore the wristbands because another federal judge in New Hampshire, Landya McCafferty, who was appointed to her seat by President Obama in 2013, ruled two transgender athletes would be allowed to play on high school girls soccer teams, overruling a state law in place to prevent that from happening.  Fifteen-year-old Parker Tirrell, a transgender athlete, was allowed to compete for Plymouth Regional High School. In a lawsuit filed by Fellers and Foote, they alleged they were told by school officials to remove the armbands or they would have to leave the game.  TRANS VOLLEYBALL PLAYER LEGAL HEARING OPENED WITH LONG AND HEATED DEBATE OVER WHAT PRONOUNS TO USE Both of the fathers say the intention of the armband was not to protest Tirrell, but to support their own daughters in a game that featured a biological male.  McAuliffe questioned the notion that the wristbands were in support of their own daughters. ""Sometimes the message you think you’re sending might not be the message that is being sent,"" he said. McAuliffe asked Foote whether it occurred to him that a transgender person might interpret the pink XX wristbands as an attempt to invalidate their existence. ""If he’s a trans female, pink might be a color he likes,"" Foote responded. First lady Jill Biden, right, and Steven J. McAuliffe, widower of Christa McAuliffe, arrive at the Christa McAuliffe School in Concord, N.H., March 17, 2021. (Jessica Rinaldi/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) Transgender inclusion in girls' and women's sports emerged as a mainstream political issue in the last few years. Instances of athletes discovered to be male and then legally protected to continue playing have emerged in rapid succession since the start of the Biden administration.  This includes instances like those involving Tirrell in New Hampshire and others in Virginia and California. At the college level, a situation at San Jose State University involving a transgender volleyball player has prompted multiple lawsuits and a media firestorm. It became a talking point of Donald Trump's presidential campaign before his recent election win.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump and even his wife, Melania, who has admitted to disagreeing with Republicans on issues of LGBT rights, each announced they are opposed to letting biological males compete in girls and women's sports. Trump advocated for a blanket ban during a Fox News town hall event on the campaign trail.  Multiple states filed lawsuits and enacted their own laws to address the issue after the Biden-Harris administration issued a sweeping rule that clarified that Title IX’s ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions,"" in April.  The administration insisted the regulation does not address athletic eligibility. However, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that it would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.  The Supreme Court then voted 5-4 in August to reject an emergency request by the Biden administration to enforce portions of that new rule after more than two dozen Republican attorneys general sued to block the Title IX changes in their own states. During the most recent election cycle, multiple Democrats, including Texas Rep. Collin Allred backtracked on past support for transgender inclusion in women's sports.  That trend continued after the election when Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton spoke out against his party's stance and actions in enabling transgender inclusion in multiple interviews, inciting fierce backlash and even a massive pro-transgender rally outside his office.  Now, multiple judges like McAuliffe across the country are presiding over cases about the eligibility of transgender athletes in sports.  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Alex Ovechkin was on a hot streak, and it became a matter of when, not if, he would eventually break Wayne Gretzky's record for the most goals in NHL history. But the future Hall of Famer's quest for that record will have to wait. After scoring two goals Monday, Ovechkin left the game with a lower-body injury. On Thursday, the Washington Capitals announced it is a broken fibula that will keep Ovechkin out four to six weeks.

The 39-year-old broke his leg in a shin-on-shin collision Monday night with Utah's Jack McBain, and some of his closest teammates knew it was not good news even before Ovechkin was listed as week to week and placed on injured reserve. Ovechkin had a hat trick in the previous game and leads the league with 15 goals this season. Ovechkin in his first 19 seasons missed 59 games and just 35 due to injury. Durability, even while throwing his body around with his physical style, is a big reason he is on track to pass Gretzky’s mark of 894 goals that once looked unapproachable.

Watch as Nick explains why 'America's Team' should beg Mike Vrable to take over and ‘create a real football program.’ Here come the tears.  Dallas Cowboys franchise quarterback Dak Prescott admitted just how bad his team's failed season has made him feel about himself.  Prescott told The Dallas Morning News this week he couldn't hold back the emotion or the tears when he sat down and realized just how bad his team really is.

Prescott says nearly all the tendons connecting his hamstring to his pelvis tore off, and there is only one left.  ""It started to lift off the bone even more,"" Prescott said.

ESPN STAR GETTING ‘VERY, VERY WORRIED’ ABOUT JERRY JONES, HAS JOE BIDEN IN MIND Prescott underwent season-ending surgery, which was announced by owner Jerry Jones Nov. 12. In Prescott's absence, backup quarterback Cooper Rush has only made things worse for the spiraling Cowboys. The team is on pace for its worst season in 35 years.  They have just three wins. And if they don't win at least two of their last seven games, it will be their worst winning percentage in a season since their one-win campaign in 1989.  The team's 3-7 start is its worst since 2020, and Prescott, statistically, was off to one of his worst starts as a passer. With eight interceptions in eight games, Prescott recorded the worst passer rating and second-worst interception percentage of his career in a single season.

His representatives announced he agreed to a four-year, $240 million contract just hours before the season opener against the Cleveland Browns Sept. 8.  Now, many around the NFL and sports media have used the Cowboys failure as a springboard for comedy.  Former Broncos Super Bowl Champion and current ESPN host Shannon Sharpe blasted the Cowboys on his latest episode of the ""Nightcap"" podcast.  ""I would’ve left the stadium with a bag over my head. Ain’t no way you’ll see me leaving the stadium when I got beat like that. After I’ve gotten beat like that every game. … And you do this?"" Sharpe said. ""It’s disrespectful. It’s disrespectful to the fans who pay their hard-earned money. But you know what, it couldn’t happen to a better franchise. Because all that owner do is run his mouth and talk about what they’re gonna do. … And all their players do, because they take it from the owner, is run their mouth — and they ain’t won dog crap. None of them."" The Denver Broncos' Shannon Sharpe (84) in action against the Kansas City Chiefs in 1996. (Damian Strohmeyer/Sports Illustrated via Getty Images) Legendary NFL quarterback Peyton Manning was one of the most prominent figures to weigh in. During a bit hosting the Country Music Awards Wednesday night, Manning joked that Prescott isn't the only Cowboy to cry this year, pointing to owner Jerry Jones.

Smith said Tuesday he had President Biden on his mind when he watched the Dallas Cowboys owner talk to reporters after the team's loss to the Houston Texans. Smith added that the Cowboys have been so bad this year, he can't celebrate it as effusively as he normally might. They're so bad it makes him ""sad,"" he said. Smith said players like Micah Parsons look like they are about to ""see a therapist"" because they're ""depressed.""  ""I’m getting very, very worried about Jerry Jones because the only thing that’s worse than the team’s play is his press conferences, or whatever you want to call it, when he is in front of the reporters, where he says one thing after another after another,"" Smith said. ""I find myself thinking about Joe Biden before he backed out of running for re-election."" Even Cowboys Hall of Famer and three-time Super Bowl champion Troy Aikman suggested head coach Mike McCarthy will be gone after this year.  Dallas Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy on the sideline against the Atlanta Falcons during the second half at Mercedes-Benz Stadium Nov. 3, 2024.

He’s proven it here. You win 12 games three years in a row, you’re doing something right. But he didn’t get a contract extension after he had done that. It’s hard to imagine him getting one now."" But even with all the bad press and losing, Prescott still says this year has been ""one of the best"" of his life off the field because he hasn't let the team's failures bring down his spirits.  ""Off the field, it's been some of the most joyous times I ever could have imagined, dreamed of. Having a child, getting engaged, starting a family. But, then, on the football field, it's probably been as tough of a season as I've ever had. I'd probably say the toughest.""

LAS VEGAS – The McLaren Formula 1 Racing Team entered the Las Vegas Grand Prix in first place in the Constructors' Championship standings, hoping to win their first title since 1998. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have both proven to be formidable forces on the racetrack throughout the entire season and hold a narrow lead over Ferrari and Red Bull. A 1-2 finish for the McLaren drivers will help the team get ever closer to that title.

He spoke to the media as he touted the team’s partnership with Mastercard. ""I think we have a good chance,"" he said. ""Ferrari may be the team to beat this weekend. I think we’ve got a very strong race car with two awesome racing drivers. It’s a little bit of a home race for me – not necessarily from Las Vegas, it’s my home country. So, for me, it feels a little bit more special. ""It’s a fantastic venue, of course. It’s our first race together with (the Mastercard) brand on our race car. It’s very exciting. We have a tremendous amount of support, and we’re counting down to race weekend. For me, if we can win this race or extend our Constructors' lead, it would be a successful weekend.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. An AFC North rivalry had another page added to its long book of ugly history on Thursday night. The Cleveland Browns squeaked out a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers in blizzard conditions on their home turf, but as soon as the game ended, things turned sour for two players. Russell Wilson was aiming for the end zone on the final play of the game, and his pass fell incomplete to give the Browns a 24-19 victory.

Cameras missed the beginning of what looked to be an ugly skirmish, but a quick pan appeared to show the two getting tangled up by the stands. The camera then showed Pickens being held back by two members of stadium security near the seats. One fan was even holding Pickens' arm, leading to initial speculation that Pickens was getting into it with fans. Newsome is eventually seen standing up from the ground and walking away from the ruckus. It is not the first time Pickens' temper has gotten out of hand. In his rookie season, he yelled at coaches after a teammate dropped a pass. Last season, he was called out for what appeared to be a lack of effort.

The league’s first snow game of the season appeared to be a low-scoring bout at first, but a fourth-quarter thriller ensued in the harsh conditions as the Cleveland Browns upset the Pittsburgh Steelers, 24-19, in a wild AFC North battle.  The Browns moved to 3-8 on the season, while the Steelers are now 8-3.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,"Jake Paul’s business partner talks claims of rigged Mike Tyson fight, says Paul is boxing's 'greatest gift'",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/jake-pauls-business-partner-talks-claims-rigged-mike-tyson-fight-says-paul-boxings-greatest-gift,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 06:00:48 -0500",Most Valuable Promotions co-founder Nakisa Bidarian says the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight was &quot;100% real&quot; and that the 27-year-old mogul is boxing&apos;s &quot;greatest gift.&quot;,"Most Valuable Promotions co-founder Nakisa Bidarian discusses Jake Paul's legacy in boxing and the recent claims of the fight against Mike Tyson being rigged. A sports icon came out of retirement last Friday, leading to decibels that are seldom touched at a sporting event, as 58-year-old Mike Tyson, in his first professional fight since 2005, battled Jake Paul in front of more than 70,000 fans at AT&T Stadium in Arlingon, Texas. But by the middle of the fight, boo-birds rang out in the crowd, and with Paul winning by unanimous decision, accusations of a rigged fight ran all over social media. If you know Jake Paul, none of that bothers him. He thrives off the hate and has embraced the role of the heel in boxing and life. ""He’s the ‘problem child,’ people want to boo him, and that’s the special sauce that he has,"" said Nakisa Bidarian, co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions, in a recent interview with Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  (Cooper Neill/Getty Images for Netflix) Bidarian and Paul co-founded MVP together three years ago, and their promotions have helped put women’s boxing on the map with two spectacles by Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano, the second of which was the co-main event last week in Arlington. Although Bidarian admitted that the 60 million households watching the fight and the largest gate outside of Las Vegas ever was probably more because of Tyson, he said Paul ""played a massive role"" in the historic event. It was historic by just about every metric: attendance, viewers, gate, bets placed, social media discussion. But the overwhelming reaction to the fight was that it was a disappointment. ""I don’t care what people have to say. They’re always going to have something to say. It is what it is,"" Paul told Fox News Digital after the fight. Added Bidarian in his interview, ""The only win there was if Mike Tyson knocked out Jake Paul, otherwise, the haters would have found a way to complain no matter what."" But with it being a Paul spectacle, there is, once again, some speculation about the fight being rigged, fixed or staged. Jake Paul, left, is announced as the winner over Mike Tyson at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Nov. 15, 2024. (Al Bello/Getty Images for Netflix ©2024) Some fans have tried to point out instances in which the former heavyweight champ could have easily knocked out Paul with an uppercut; some have said that Tyson was biting on his gloves to keep himself from going wild in the ring. Some fans also believe that there was no way a boxer with just four years of experience could have possibly beaten the ""Baddest Man on the Planet."" But all of those claims are BS, Bidarian said. ""In terms of this fight specifically, I will say the following: It was sanctioned by the athletic commission. Our partner was Netflix, who is the biggest media company in America and is a public entity. There was professional sports betting on the event,"" Bidarian said. ""So, if you were to rig such competition, it is a federal crime. And myself, Jake Paul, Mike Tyson, executives from Netflix would all be going to jail, they would be risking their entire company, and we would be risking our entire lives to do that. It is preposterous that people even suggest that this was in any way anything other than a professional fight. … That was not the case in any Jake fight, let alone this one."" ""This was 100% real from beginning to end,"" he added. ""It was so real that the guy had an ulcer, and we took a five-month break to give him time to heal the ulcer to be able to perform at his best level. If it was staged, why did we even postpone it? We could have just moved forward with the date: ‘Oh, you have an ulcer, you’re not going to hit each other. It’s going to be fine.’ What are people talking about?"" Mike Tyson and Jake Paul exchange punches at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Nov. 15, 2024. (Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images) JAKE PAUL-MIKE TYSON SNOOZER DRAWS HARSH CRITICISM: 'NOT GREAT FOR BOXING' Even some more high-profile fighters at the top of their game have called out Paul, including Ryan Garcia, lightweight champion Gervonta Davis, heavyweight champion Daniel Dubois and undisputed light heavyweight champion Artur Beterbiev. Bidarian said that ""with the exception of one,"" Paul is interested in ""all"" of the inquiries. ""What’s next for Jake is whatever Jake wants it to be. He is the biggest face in all of boxing. … His goal is to be a world champion, so you’ll see us do things that give him those opportunities. And our goal is to think outside the box, do disruptive things and capture the imagination. We did that last Friday, and we’ll continue to do that."" It’s no secret that Paul is disliked, and many think this is all just a marketing play. It’s no secret that Paul is a marketing whiz, and some of his opponents have been selected rather wisely. But as much of a businessman as Paul may be, Bidarian said he sees him ""first and foremost"" as a boxer. ""That’s what he dedicates anywhere from 70 to 75% of his time,"" Bidarian said. At the same time, Paul puts emphasis on ""professional"" in the term ""professional boxer."" ""He is the most professional boxer in professional boxing. He is a businessman, he conducts himself like a business, he shows up on time, he delivers every line you need to deliver, he does the promo when no one else wants to. …"" Bidarian said. ""He knows how to sell. [Dallas Cowboys owner] Jerry Jones said to Jake Paul, ‘Kid, you’re one of the greatest marketers in all of sports.’ And that’s true. He’s four years into this sport, and he’s co-headlining a record-setting event."" That’s why Bidarian has a rather strong message to those who don’t believe Paul is a serious boxer.

(Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile via Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Show me another athlete, including their amateur or high school career, who has four and a half years of experience that has achieved as much as he has achieved inside and outside of the ring,"" Bidarian said. ""Even in that performance against Mike Tyson, who is 58, is very unique for someone who is four years into doing a sport. … Jake Paul has gone into the lions’ den and showed that he outboxed a much more skilled boxer in his heyday than Jake Paul, and that’s a lot more impressive than 99% of boxers do in their 10th, 12th, 15th fight.""

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Colorado star Travis Hunter 'for sure' entering NFL Draft but focused on Big 12 title race,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/colorados-2way-star-travis-hunter-eyes-big-12-title-and-more-before-for-sure-entering-nfl-draft,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 21:10:26 -0500","Travis Hunter made a pair of proclamations when he announced he’s &apos;for sure&apos; turning pro after this season, but not until he sees Colorado all the way to a Big 12 title and CFP berth.","Travis Hunter made a pair of proclamations Thursday: He's for sure entering the NFL draft after this season, but not until he sees Colorado all the way through the College Football Playoff — if the Buffaloes make it there. The first was already a given for the draft-eligible junior who plays both receiver and cornerback, and says he wants to do the same in the NFL. The second is a risk-reward play for a projected high first-round pick who averages around 120 snaps a game. In years past, it took two extra postseason wins to capture a national title. Now, it could take up to four additional contests. That’s more of a chance to shine, but also more chance for an injury. ""I don’t think nobody will opt out because you’re showing NFL teams that you’re more focused on something else, other than the team goal,"" Hunter said of the expanded 12-team College Football Playoff. ""So I don’t think players are going to opt out of the playoffs."" Hunter and quarterback Shedeur Sanders chatted Thursday in a set of Zoom calls about turning around the program at Colorado (from 4-8 last season to bowl eligibility), chasing a Big 12 title, turning pro — Hunter acknowledged he will ""for sure"" — and, of course, the Heisman race, where Hunter is currently the odds-on favorite in an award each wants to see the other win. ""He’s deserving of it, and if it’s between me and him, I want him to get it,"" said Sanders, whose 16th-ranked Buffaloes (8-2, 6-1 Big 12, No. 16 CFP ) travel to Arrowhead Stadium to face Kansas (3:30 p.m. ET on FOX and the FOX Sports App) this weekend. ""He does a lot of amazing things that have never been done before."" Countered Hunter: ""I know he wants me to win it, but I also want him to win as bad as I want to win it."" Hunter is a generational talent shining on both sides of the ball. As a receiver, he has 74 catches for 911 yards and nine touchdowns. On defense, he has picked off three passes, even though teams are reluctant to throw his direction. Like he did in high school and now in college, he believes he can do both on the next level. But he understands the trepidation of the NFL team that picks him. ""They don’t want their top pick to go down too early,"" Hunter said. ""I like when people tell me I can’t do it, because they just motivate me to continue to do what I want to do."" Sanders is turning in a stellar season as well with 27 touchdown passes, one away from tying Sefo Liufau for the most in a single season in program history. He's projected to be one of the first QBs off the draft board. The future certainly looks bright at Colorado thanks to the legacies Sanders and Hunter will leave under coach Deion Sanders. But that's a point to ponder later. ""I can’t think too much forward past Saturday,"" Shedeur Sanders cracked. ""The main thing is winning the Big 12 championship. That’s the main thing we’re focused on."" Reporting by The Associated Press.

(Credit: X /Bill Carl Johnson) Just hours after voting to finance repairs to the home stadium of the Tampa Bay Rays, the St. Petersburg City Council reversed course.  The Rays will now pay the division rival New York Yankees $15 million to play their home regular-season games at New York's spring training ballpark. That is now the only certain home the Rays will have until further notice.  The stadium's fiberglass roof was ripped clean off Oct. 9 when Hurricane Milton swept ashore just south of Tampa Bay. Then came the destructive water damage inside the venue, causing an estimated $55.7 million in damage. The extensive repairs cannot be finished before the 2026 season, city documents show. The city at least would have supplied some funding and started the process with its initial vote, which was a 4-3 decision.

Smith/AFP via Getty Images) The initial vote Thursday was to get moving on the roof portion of the repair. Once that was done, crews would begin working on laying down a new baseball field and fixing damaged seating and office areas and a variety of electronic systems, which would require another vote to approve money for the remaining restoration. Members who opposed it said there wasn’t enough clarity on numerous issues, including how much would be covered by the ballpark’s insurance and what amount might be provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. TRUMP TO PRESIDE OVER HISTORIC SPORTING EVENTS — WHICH TEAMS AND STARS COULD SKIP WHITE HOUSE VISITS? The reversal on fixing Tropicana Field came after the council voted to delay consideration of revenue bonds for a proposed new $1.3 billion Rays ballpark. Just two days earlier, the Pinellas County Commission postponed a vote on its share of the new stadium bonds, leaving that project in limbo. ""This is a sad place. I’m really disappointed,"" council Chair Deborah Figg-Sanders said. ""We won’t get there if we keep finding ways we can’t."" The Rays say the lack of progress puts the new stadium plan and the future of Tropicana Field in jeopardy. ""I can’t say I’m confident about anything,"" Rays Co-President Brian Auld told council members. Cots at Tropicana Field before the arrival of Hurricane Milton in St. Petersburg, Fla., Oct. 7, 2024.    (Reuters/Octavio Jones) The reversal now means the city and Rays must work on an alternative in the coming weeks so that Tropicana Field can possibly be ready for the 2026 season. ""I’d like to pare it down and see exactly what we’re obligated to do,"" council member John Muhammad said. Several council members said before the vote on the $23.7 million to fix the roof that the city is contractually obligated to do so. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""I don’t see a way out of it.

The Philadelphia 76ers' front office bolstered the team's roster by adding Paul George and other key players in the offseason.  The addition of draft pick Jared McCain also contributed to high expectations the Sixers carried into the 2024-25 season.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. To nobody’s surprise, Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani were named the AL and NL MVPs Thursday, each receiving all 30 first-place votes. He may not have broken his single-season home run record he set during his 2022 MVP season, but the New York Yankees captain was once again dominant at the plate to receive his second career nod as the MVP in the American League. Judge beat out Juan Soto, who he hopes to play with again in 2025 in pinstripes, and Kansas City Royals phenom Bobby Witt Jr., who received all 30 second-place votes. Judge led the league in homers for the third time in his career, launching 58 long balls while posting league highs in WAR (10.8), RBIs (144), slugging percentage (.701), on-base percentage (.458) and OPS+ (223).

It was eventually determined Ohtani did not know about the gambling, nor did he bet himself. CHRIS SALE, TARIK SKUBAL EARN FIRST CAREER CY YOUNG AWARDS Fans wondered if he would be able to have an MVP-type season strictly as a DH.  The Dodgers superstar became the first player in MLB history to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in the same season. The home run ball that made history sold for a record $4.39 million. His 134 runs scored and 411 total bases were the most in the majors, and he led the National League in home runs (54), RBIs (130), on-base percentage (.390), slugging percentage (646) and a 9.2 bWAR.  His .310 average in the NL was second behind only Luis Arráez's .314, and his 59 stolen bases trailed only Elly De La Cruz, who swiped five more bags.

President Biden hosted the 2024 NBA champion Boston Celtics at the White House on Thursday, but he was either not completely sure of that or making a joke. While announcing the team's latest championship, Biden turned to the team to make sure they were called the Celtics.  ""You're the Celtics, right?"" Biden asked the players during a moment in his address. The comment was met with light but reserved chuckles from some in the crowd.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Biden also joked that he didn't know where the players came from. ""They just showed up. I don’t know where the hell they came from,"" Biden said.  Later in the speech, Biden appeared to reveal his Secret Service code name. ""Celtic"" has been Biden's code name throughout his presidency and even dating back to his vice presidency under President Obama, according to Britannica.   ""All of you may not know this, but my Secret Service name is ‘Celtic.’ For real, because I’m Irish,"" Biden said. ""Everybody behind me is Irish in their heart. I feel a special pride in this trophy for this old Irish Celtic. To all you Celtics, congratulations."" President Biden, flanked by Boston Celtics players Jayson Tatum, left, and Derrick White, holds up a jersey they presented to him during an event to celebrate the team's victory in the 2024 NBA championship on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Biden concluded his speech by pointing out that John F. Kennedy was the first president to host an NBA champion when the Celtics visited in 1963. ""Part of that wonderful tradition, celebrating the power of sports to bring people together. It’s a tradition that I’ve had the honor to continue. No matter the sport. What these champions all have in common are core values. … Hard work, teamwork, respect and the knowledge that no one of us is ever as good as all of us can be when we’re together,"" he said. After Biden's speech, he received a custom Celtics jersey and took a basketball with him as he walked down the stairs. He dribbled the ball and even made a few passes to attendees in the crowd.  TRUMP TO PRESIDE OVER HISTORIC SPORTING EVENTS — WHICH TEAMS AND STARS COULD SKIP WHITE HOUSE VISITS?

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis) The 2023-24 Celtics roster, coaching staff and ownership group were on hand on the South Lawn for Thursday’s event. The 2023 champion Denver Nuggets did not attend a Biden White House visit, reportedly due to ""scheduling issues,"" the team previously told The Denver Post.  Prior to Thursday, the last NBA champion to visit Biden's White House was the 2021-2022 Golden State Warriors. Those Warriors visited in late January 2023. The Celtics' White House visit was scheduled for November. By late January of next year, Trump will be in office.

However, the only two teams to win the title under Trump prior to the COVID-19 pandemic were the Warriors, who Trump did not invite, and the Toronto Raptors, who are based in Canada.  Trump infamously declined to invite several major women's basketball championship teams to the White House during his first term, including every WNBA champion.  The Baylor women’s NCAA championship basketball team and their coach Kim Mulkey present President Trump with a jersey during a visit to the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., on April 29, 2019. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) The one time Trump's White House hosted a women's basketball team was the 2019 national champion Baylor Bears, led by former head coach Kim Mulkey.  The only two NFL teams to get invitations to Trump's White House during his first term were the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles. The Patriots accepted both invitations in 2017 and 2019. The Eagles' visit was canceled, and the team released a statement saying it was in relation to Trump's stance on players standing for the national anthem. During Trump's first term, and even during his recent campaign, college football has been the sport to embrace him the most in the U.S. His appearances at games, including multiple Army-Navy games during his first term and a Georgia-Alabama game in September, were met with rousing applause. No college football national champion skipped a White House visit during Trump's first term. Georgia skipped a visit to President Biden's White House in 2023.

"NY Post Sports – Latest News, Scores, Stats & Videos",USC’s JuJu Watkins has to prove it against Notre Dame’s guards in first great game of women’s college basketball season,https://nypost.com/2024/11/22/sports/womens-college-basketball-games-to-watch-juju-watkins-usc-vs-notre-dame/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:36:42 -0500","The No. 6 Notre Dame women’s basketball team (4-0) has breezed through the first 2 ½ weeks of the season, annihilating opponents by an average of 47.5 points.","The No. 6 Notre Dame women’s basketball team (4-0) has breezed through the first 2 ½ weeks of the season, annihilating opponents by an average of 47.5 points. It’s hard to know what’s more impressive about the Fighting Irish. Is it their offensive dominance? Or perhaps their stifling defense that’s kept opposing teams to 31.2% shooting?  Then again, the early returns on Notre Dame’s season are inflated, considering the Fighting Irish haven’t faced much of a challenge in four tuneup games.  But the slow ramp-up for their season is over, and the real competition is set to begin when Niele Ivey’s team travels to Los Angeles to take on No. 3 USC (4-0) on Saturday (4 p.m. ET, NBC).  “We’re really excited,“ Niele Ivey told reporters this week. “The fact that we get to be on this big stage, it’s just an incredible matchup. They have some of the biggest names out in women’s basketball right now.” Ivey is referring to USC sophomore standout JuJu Watkins and potential 2025 WNBA lottery pick Kiki Iriafen.  Watkins was a basketball big shot even before she stepped on the court last season for the Trojans.  But her remarkable first-year campaign — during which she set a single-season record for a freshman by scoring 920 points – only elevated her stature. This season, Watkins is averaging 21.5 points, 6.3 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 3.8 steals and 3.0 blocks in four games.  Iriafen, a transfer from Stanford, has posted 17.3 points to go with her team-high 7.5 rebounds per game.  But make no mistake about it: Notre Dame has a few stars of its own, too, which adds to the intrigue of this early-season showdown of two possible Final Four teams.  It helps that point guard Olivia Miles, another potential 2025 lottery pick, returned to the Fighting Irish’s lineup after missing all of last season because of a knee injury.  Miles’ elite passing abilities and improving 3-point shooting make up just one half of what could be the most dynamic backcourt in college basketball this season. Sophomore All-American guard Hannah Hidalgo, who set several program records for Notre Dame last season, also is picking up where she left off. She leads the team in scoring (25 points per game) and steals (5.3 per game).   Hidalgo’s scrappy approach on the defensive end makes her a menace to opposing guards and could help wear down Watkins over the course of Saturday’s tilt. After all, the way to beat USC is not to go into the game with the mindset of stopping Watkins – that’s not going to happen – but rather to make her work for every point. Other players who might be up for the defensive assignment include Sonia Citron and Cassandre Prospect.   Saturday will be a chance for Notre Dame to make a statement and prove it’s a legitimate national title threat this season.  Here are three more games you should know about this week: No. 1 South Carolina (5-0) at No. 5 UCLA (4-0), Sunday, 4 p.m. ET, FS1: The schedule makers delivered basketball fans quite the treat this weekend with not just one but two marquee matchups — and both of them in Los Angeles, at that. The second potential Final Four preview features South Carolina with its 43-game winning streak on the line. South Carolina’s star big from a season ago, Kamilla Cardoso, went to the WNBA. Chloe Kitts has been working to fill the 6-foot-7 void left by Cardoso’s departure, but she doesn’t have nearly the same size and skills inside as her successor. Enter UCLA 6-foot-7 center Lauren Betts, who could be a matchup nightmare for the Gamecocks. Betts is averaging 21.5 points on 72.5% shooting and is corralling 11.5 rebounds per game, which could be a big problem for South Carolina. Then again, the Gamecocks have legendary coach Dawn Staley, who’s no stranger to leading a team that has a target on its back. This game could come down to the wire.  No. 2 UConn (4-0) vs. Oregon State (1-3) in Nassau, Bahamas, Monday, 7:30 p.m. ET: Geno Auriemma added yet another impressive notch on his belt this week when he became the all-time winningest coach in college basketball. UConn’s win against Fairleigh Dickinson on Wednesday was the 1,217th of Auriemma’s career, surpassing former Stanford coach Tara Vanderveer for the record. Auriemma’s win count is sure to continue to swell, starting Monday against Oregon State at the Baha Mar Women’s Championship. This Huskies team is loaded with talent and has a deep bench – a luxury that had eluded it in past seasons because of injuries. Azzi Fudd is back in the fold after a year away because of a knee injury. And Paige Bueckers, a favorite to go No. 1 in the 2025 WNBA draft, continues to dazzle.  No. 16 North Carolina (3-1) vs. Ball State (4-0) in Nassau, Bahamas, Saturday, 6:30 p.m. ET: North Carolina enters this weekend as a favorite to win the annual Battle 4 Atlantic tournament. Sure, the Tar Heels are coming off a tough loss at UConn, but that might only fuel them this weekend. Ball State will be putting its perfect record on the line. The Cardinals managed to squeeze out a win against Northern Iowa last week, which proved to be more impressive than initially believed. Could Ball State pull off a stunner? Maya, oh my. Maya McDermott was a catalyst for Northern Iowa, who took the cake this week for the biggest upset of the young women’s basketball season.  The unranked Panthers stunned No. 8 Iowa State on Wednesday night, 87-75, as McDermott dropped a career-high 37 points.  It marked Northern Iowa’s first win against a top-10 opponent in program history and will go down as a day to remember for McDermott, who grew up in a Des Moines suburb just 30 miles south of Iowa State’s campus."
"NY Post Sports – Latest News, Scores, Stats & Videos","Duke vs. Arizona prediction: College basketball picks, odds, best bets Friday",https://nypost.com/2024/11/22/betting/duke-vs-arizona-prediction-college-basketball-picks-odds-best-bets-friday/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:30:00 -0500","Duke's versatile freshman Cooper Flagg shines, while Arizona’s fast-paced offense and elite rebounding make them both title contenders this season.","On Friday night, the No. 12 Duke Blue Devils will make the long flight from the East Coast to the Southwest for a date with the No. 17 Arizona Wildcats. This matchup marks another opportunity for the country to get a good look at Cooper Flagg, the likely top pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. Thus far, Flagg has led the Blue Devils in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks per game. Can the Blue Devils grab their first ranked win of the season after failing to hold off Kentucky or will the Wildcats bounce back at home after a road loss to Wisconsin? (10:30 p.m. ET, ESPN) Flagg’s transition from high school to college basketball has been virtually seamless, as he has already established himself as one of the best players in the sport. At 6-foot-9, Flagg can play and defend multiple positions, giving him the versatility to fit into any role at the next level. Duke’s offensive talent doesn’t end with Flagg, though, as it has other future pros, such as junior guard Tyrese Proctor, freshman center Khaman Maluach and freshman wing Kon Knueppel.  Even with a loss, the Blue Devils still rank fourth in adjusted efficiency margin (KenPom) and second in adjusted defensive efficiency.  The Blue Devils are frightening. They lost by five points to Kentucky despite shooting a putrid 4-for-24 from 3-point land and a few critical late-game Flagg turnovers. It’s further proof that this team is a legitimate title contender come March. Meanwhile, the Wildcats continue to be among the country’s fastest and most efficient teams, ranking fourth in adjusted tempo and 14th in adjusted offensive efficiency. Their trio of returning guards, including Jaden Bradley, Caleb Love and KJ Lewis, can apply pressure in transition as well as any unit in college basketball, as evidenced by the team’s 94.3-point-per-game average. Unsurprisingly, Arizona is again one of the best rebounding teams, ranking first in offensive rebounding percentage and total rebounding rate. Still, I have the Blue Devils narrowly squeaking by Arizona on the road. Arizona looked sloppy against Wisconsin, giving up backdoor cuts, straight-line drives, open 3-point looks and a game-high 41 points to John Tonje.  The Wildcats (317th in fouls per game) also fouled Wisconsin an absurd amount, putting it on the charity stripe for 41 free-throw attempts. Imagine what Flagg, Proctor, Knueppel and Caleb Foster can do to the Wildcats. And this is where the stars could align for Duke’s shooters (11th in 3PAs), as positive regression is inevitable, especially since the Wildcats have been suspect at defending the 3-point line. Currently, Duke is the more disciplined team, holding opponents to just 25.7% shooting from behind the arc and turning the ball over fewer than 10 times per game. I’ll take Duke with the points. THE PICK: Duke +1.5 (-108, DraftKings) Andrew Norton handicaps the NBA, WNBA, NFL, college basketball and football, UFC and golf. During the 2022-23 NBA season, he achieved a standout 14.1% ROI, cashing 60% of his NBA spread picks and leading Tallysight in its SportsIQ metric."
"NY Post Sports – Latest News, Scores, Stats & Videos",49ers turning to Kyle Allen with Brock Purdy ruled out for critical Packers matchup,https://nypost.com/2024/11/22/sports/49ers-turning-to-kyle-allen-with-brock-purdy-ruled-out/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:03:10 -0500",The 49ers are going to have to dip into their quarterback depth this weekend.,"The 49ers are going to have to dip into their quarterback depth this weekend.  Head coach Kyle Shanahan announced on Friday that backup Brandon Allen will get the starting nod for San Francisco against the Packers. The move comes as starter Brock Purdy is dealing with shoulder soreness, which limited him in practice this week.  The issue was enough to have him ruled out for Sunday, which is a key road matchup in the middle of the season for the 49ers.  The 49ers — which will also be without star edge rusher Nick Bosa (left hip and oblique) — are 5-5 entering the game against 7-3 Green Bay, sitting10th in the NFC, meaning they are on the outside looking in for the playoff picture. They now will turn to Allen, who has not started a game in three years. His biggest action in the NFL came in the 2020 season when he started five games (1-4 records), completing 63.4 percent of his passes with five touchdowns and four interceptions. Since that season, he’s thrown just 37 passes in the regular season. He’ll face off against a Packers defense that ranks 15th in the NFL in passing yards allowed per game this season (329) and will be without cornerback Jaire Alexander and linebacker Edgerrin Cooper. Allen will have Joshua Dobbs as his backup on Sunday. The 49ers next face the Bills next Sunday night, making this Packers game all the more important."

"NY Post Sports – Latest News, Scores, Stats & Videos","Mavericks vs. Nuggets prediction, odds: NBA picks, best bets",https://nypost.com/2024/11/22/betting/mavericks-vs-nuggets-prediction-odds-nba-picks-best-bets/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:00:00 -0500",The Mavericks will try to keep their winning streak alive without Luka Doncic as they face the Nuggets.,"Just when the Dallas Mavericks look ready to turn the corner, an injury to Luka Doncic could potentially derail their progress. Doncic is dealing with a strained wrist and the Mavericks expect he’ll be out of action for one week. Dallas will put its three-game winning streak on the line when it visits the Denver Nuggets on Friday night.  Denver also appears to be on the ascent, with six victories in its last eight games.  However, it has been without the reigning MVP, Nikola Jokic, for the last three games due to a personal matter. Jokic’s availability is still up in the air, as the Nuggets list him as questionable on the injury report. While it’s always difficult to make projections on a game when teams aren’t at full strength, the props market is an excellent option for determining which teammates will likely step up in the absence of a star player. The Mavericks are notorious for their slow starts, so it wasn’t entirely surprising to see their record fall to 5-7. However, most would say the combination of Doncic and Kyrie Irving are two of the most unguardable players in the league. Thus, it would only be a matter of time before Dallas would regain its stride. While the NBA season can be long and arduous, there are always a few games throughout the campaign that take on another level of importance.  For Dallas, its away victory (121-119) over the Thunder offered a similar significance because heading into the game, OKC had the best record in the West at 11-2.  Dallas followed up that performance with a 131-91 demolition over the New Orleans Pelicans.If you overlook this Mavericks team, you do so at your peril.  The underlying metrics suggest they’re still very much a legitimate contender that can challenge and come out of the West. Denver rebounded from a 0-2 start to win seven of its next eight games.  However, it’s 1-2 in the last three games with Jokic sidelined. Jokic is having another MVP-caliber season, averaging a triple-double with 29.7 points, 13.7 rebounds and 11.7 assists. Per Basketball-Reference, Jokic also leads the league with a 33.3 Player Efficiency Rating and Win Shares per 48 minutes (.323). Thus, the Nuggets don’t have anywhere close to a ready-made replacement that can fill Jokic’s shoes.  Although some felt Denver didn’t do enough in the offseason when building its roster, the Russell Westbrook experiment seems to work better than we might have anticipated. Westbrook can still fill up the stats sheet, averaging 10.8 points, six assists and 4.5 rebounds. He recently recorded his 200th triple-double—the most in NBA history. Forward Peyton Watson and guard Julian Strawther have also developed nicely off the bench, with both players averaging 9.5 points. Like the Mavericks, the Nuggets will be just fine, but both teams would do well to have their star players back on the court. Picking a side in this contest wouldn’t be easy, considering these teams are two of my favorites to watch. Therefore, I’m happy to remain neutral by targeting a player in the props market. When they landed Klay Thompson over the summer, the Mavericks saw an opportunity to add a knockdown shooter. Although Thompson is averaging a career-low with 14 points, he’s also attempting his fewest shots per game (12.6). Doncic and Irving are ball-dominant players, so with one out of the lineup, Thompson figures to get more touches. The Nuggets are also a team Thompson can thrive against because they’re a bottom-10 defense. He’s averaging 20.3 points In his last 13 games when facing teams that this profile. Thompson’s scoring prop is available at 16.5, which feels short given the opponent. It’s worth noting that he’s coming off a 19-point effort against the Pelicans.  Lastly, he’s had three games this season in which he produced back-to-back efforts of 17 or more points.  I expect that trend to continue Friday night.  THE PICK: Klay Thompson Over 16.5 points (-113, FanDuel) Michael Arinze handicaps most major sports for the New York Post. He’s cashed two 15-leg teasers in his betting career as well as a 12-leg parlay that included eight Little League World Series games. More recently, he accurately picked finalists in the 2024 European Championships and Copa America."

Smith berated the Giants in a scathing rant while defending his ESPN colleague Elle Duncan, who might’ve made herself an enemy of the Giants.  Duncan’s remarks about Daniel Jones’ farewell speech — during which he thanked the Giants before they granted his release on Friday — didn’t sit well with Giants faithful, including Pat Hanlon, the team’s senior vice president of communications, who called her out on X. During Friday’s installment of “First Take,” Smith told the Giants to stop whining and claimed the organization called ESPN to complain about Duncan’s “Taking the L” segment about Jones.  “The New York Giants, respectfully, shut the hell up,” Smith said. “Y’all are awful as an organization … Y’all are sorry! Y’all are pathetic! The only reason why you get away with it is because the Jets have been worse … and you’ve got the nerve to sit up there and call the network because you want to whine and moan about your ineptitude being put on public display?” Duncan didn’t spare Jones one bit while discussing him getting benched for Tommy DeVito and demoted to fourth string after he was unable to control the Giants’ offense.   “You guys think he had this saved in his notes since like 2020? In all seriousness, DJ, I could have saved you like 90 seconds,” Duncan said, referring to his speech.  “A rewrite: I’m sorry you paid me $108 million for one playoff win. And I look forward to reviving my career as Brock Purdy’s backup. The end.”  Hanlon wasn’t thrilled with Duncan’s remarks.  “That an ESPN personality would mock Daniel Jones’ statement today is mind boggling,” he wrote on X. “Given what has happened at that company over past few years, tone deaf.” Hanlon didn’t explain further about what happened at ESPN.  The company recently went through multiple rounds of layoffs.  Many Big Blue fans thought Duncan was overly harsh and disrespectful to Jones.  Duncan, who was a guest on Friday’s “First Take,” stood by her comments.  “You want to call me disrespectful to Daniel Jones?” she said. “Am I more disrespectful than the Giants making him a scout team safety? Am I more disrespectful than all of those same fans that are in my mentions right now who booed him mercilessly for the last six seasons? I stand by everything that I said.”"

That’s because the Blueshirts have been carrying Chad Ruhwedel as the team’s seventh defenseman since he changed places on Nov. 13 with Mancini, the 22-year-old freshman righty who had been a healthy scratch for the four games prior to that. So either a top-six defenseman is being pulled for performance or health reasons and head coach Peter Laviolette does not feel comfortable inserting the 34-year-old veteran into the lineup, or the club might be down another regular defenseman, necessitating that both Mancini and Ruhwedel would dress. The Blueshirts maintained their 23-man roster by dispatching Jake Leschyshyn to the Wolf Pack in exchange for Mancini, who had played three AHL: games (1-0-1) after skating in nine Rangers matches (1-3-4) out of the gate. It is unknown whether Filip Chytil, who has missed the first three games of the trip after sustaining an upper-body injury at the Garden on Nov. 14, will dress after rejoining the club in Calgary."

Jones was granted his release from the Giants on Friday after he had been benched as starting quarterback earlier this week. Barkley, who signed with the Eagles this offseason and is having a phenomenal year amid the change of scenery, was asked about his reaction to Jones’ release during media availability on Friday. “I’m not going to speak too much on that.

It sucks to see how everything went down for him over there [with the Giants],” Barkley told reporters. “I’ve got nothing but great things to say about him. You’re not going to find anybody who’s really got a lot of negative things to say about him. But it’s the NFL. Hopefully, wherever he ends up next, they’re gonna get a guy who will come in and work. [Coming from the Giants], I’m doing well [with the Eagles]. Hopefully, he can find the same kind of fresh start and success.” Jones was in the second season of a four-year, $160 million contract with about $80 million fully guaranteed. An injury guarantee made the Giants less likely to put him on the field, forcing the team to sign Tim Boyle to the practice squad and demoting Jones to fourth-string. He spent Tuesday playing safety on the scout team. With the Giants at 2-8 — tied with the Jaguars and Raiders for the fewest wins in the league — everyone involved ultimately felt it was best for Jones to part ways.  “Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him,” Giants owner John Mara said in a statement on Friday.  “We mutually agreed that would be best for him and for the team. Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way. His handling of this situation yesterday exemplifies just that. We are all disappointed in how things have worked out. We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him. We wish him nothing but the best in the future.”"

Judge, who won his second AL MVP Award this week, said during a conference call Friday that he met with Steinbrenner in Tampa shortly after the World Series and “discussed a lot of things.” That included the potential return of Soto, whose free agency has dominated the offseason so far and included a meeting with Steinbrenner and the front office, as well as Aaron Boone, in southern California. Judge said he had yet to speak with Soto since he hit free agency, preferring to leave him alone. “I think the best thing is to give those guys space,” Judge said of Soto. “I talked to him all season. He knows how we feel about him. The most important thing is to let him do his thing… and come to the right decision for him and his family.” Of course, nothing Judge could say to Soto would mean more than the bottom line, as Soto made clear throughout his season with the Yankees and throughout the playoffs, repeating that no team would have an advantage when it came to signing him, as long as they made a good offer and gave him a chance to win. So for the Yankees to keep Soto in pinstripes, it will cost them… a lot. With the free-spending Mets and Dodgers and the dangerous Red Sox and Phillies, as well as wild cards like the Blue Jays all interested in Soto, he’ll certainly earn a contract worth more than the $360 million over nine years that Judge signed two offseasons ago. Asked Friday if he would be OK being surpassed by Soto if he returned to the Yankees, Judge laughed and said of a potential Soto contract, “Honestly, it ain’t my money. I really don’t care. If we get the best players, I’m happy. It’s never been something that’s on my mind, who gets paid the most. Whatever we can do to get the best players, I’ll take it.” Judge said he’s followed Giancarlo Stanton’s example. Stanton was pleased when Bryce Harper surpassed him as having the most expensive contract in the sport. “Even though he signed one of the first big, mega contracts back in Miami, once he came here, he didn’t care about being the highest-paid guy,’’ Judge said of Stanton. “He just wanted good players around him. And I think you could ask everybody in the room, they feel the same way.” Steinbrenner said at the Owners Meetings at MLB headquarters in Midtown on Wednesday the Yankees will “be in the mix” for Soto. There’s no doubt Soto’s presence in front of Judge in the Yankee lineup had an impact on the now two-time MVP, who had an even better offensive season this past year than he did when he first won the award in 2022, when he set the AL record with 62 homers. But Judge’s meeting with Steinbrenner in Tampa, where they both live, was about more than just retaining Soto, according to Judge. “We discussed a lot of things,’’ Judge said. “From Juan, to other guys that are out there that I think could definitely help this team.”

The Yankees have question marks not only in the outfield, but everywhere in the infield other than shortstop, as well as in the rotation and bullpen. Judge will almost certainly have a voice in at least some of those decisions thanks to his chats with Steinbrenner, who Judge called “very active” in his attempts to improve the team. “The more communication you have, top to bottom, makes everybody better,’’ Judge said. “It comes with being in the position I’m in and being captain, as well. The fact they’re listening and want to know what we have to say is a pretty cool part of it.” Judge said the two met throughout the season, as well as in the offseason, when it comes to adding players or coaches. “He’s always receptive,’’ Judge said. “My first couple years, I didn’t talk to him much. Now I see how much he cares about this organization from top to bottom. It shows why we continue to be in the position we’re in.”"

UTSA has been averaging 31.2 points per game this season, while Temple’s defense is allowing a troubling 35.0 points per game.

Except a 76er fan booing Ben Simmons.,"PHILADELPHIA — They say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Except a 76er fan booing Ben Simmons. Brooklyn’s Simmons has a history in Philadelphia, and while he’s returned to Wells Fargo Center before, he knows full well that he’ll keep getting booed by 76ers fans for the rest of his career.  But he’s not afraid of it.  He feeds off it. “Yeah, I also love that,” said Simmons, who leads his Nets back to Philadelphia tonight. “I love being in arenas where it’s loud and people are booing and all that stuff. So, it comes with the game. It’s a part of it. And I love it.” Simmons played 275 games for the Sixers over six years, missing his rookie campaign to injury and 2021-22 to mental health issues and back woes.  His detachment, hesitancy to drive and eventual holdout made him persona non grata.  One fan famously paraded all around town with a sign saying ‘F–k Ben Simmons’ — while he was still on the roster. His divorce from the 76ers was ugly, and Simmons has been the subject of hatred from their fans ever since being dealt to the Nets for James Harden. “You can only boo so much,” Simmons shrugged. This will be Simmons’ fourth time playing at Wells Fargo Center since being traded to the Nets.

But Wells Fargo Center had to beef up security in that first return — even though he was injured and not playing — and he’s aware that Philadelphia fans have elevated booing to an art form. “Sure. That’s what Philly’s about, you know? Shoot, when I was in Philly we got booed at times when we weren’t playing well. So it goes both ways,” said Simmons. “But they’re passionate fans. And that’s why Philly the city is so great, and the fans are so great.” Simmons clearly got fired up in the win over Charlotte by his clash with Hornets star Brandon Miller.  He’ll draw inspiration from the bile that is sure to come in Wells Fargo Center. “I really hope so, because it’s just cool,” said Cam Johnson. “You step back, take a look at it. And I think that’s the cool part of being an athlete, is that people really care. They might care for you, they might kind of hate on you or whatever, but the bottom line is they care. “They have somebody that they support, they have something that they cheer for, and that’s kind of what makes our league and every other professional league and sport in general go around. So it’s just something that you’ve got to embrace. I hope he embraces it. Philly’s always kind of crazy, rowdy. They’ve got a lot to say. You know when Ben comes into town, they definitely have a lot to say. But I just hope it just gives our team energy and we’re able to feed off that.” There will surely be tons of negative energy directed at Simmons, if the Nets can flip that around to positive energy to feed off and rally around their point-forward. “Yeah, you have to as a competitor,” said Brooklyn center Nic Claxton. “If people are booing you, they don’t boo people that they don’t care about. So, you’re relevant. So, you’re in their mind. You can look at it as a good thing.”"

In the wake of the boxers’ much-maligned Nov. 15 fight, they’ve been suspended 24 days by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The bans have nothing to do with Paul’s snoozfest of a win, Tyson’s listless return to the ring or even Netflix’s buffer-filled stream of the bout from AT&T Stadium in Arlington. Instead, the TDLR, which sanctioned the match, mandates combatants to rest three days for every round fought — meaning Paul and Tyson can’t so much as spar for 24 days following their eight-round face-off. Not that anyone involved isn’t staying busy in the meantime. Paul has received numerous challenges in the days since, including one from heavyweight champion Daniel Dubois, who seemingly slid into the 27-year-old’s DMs to request a fight. Tyson’s time has been spent explaining the various maladies that threatened the Paul bout, claiming he “almost died in June” in a post on X the day after they threw down. “Had 8 blood transfusions, he wrote. “Lost half my blood and 25lbs in hospital and had to fight to get healthy to fight so I won.” Netflix, on the other hand, isn’t suspended, but might want to sit on the sidelines for a while. The streaming giant has gone from the high of touting a record 108 million global viewers in 60 million households, to having to assuage the NFL ahead of their planned Christmas Day doubleheader over the serious broadcast issues showcased during the fight. Oh, and there’s the matter of a $50 million class-action lawsuit filed by a Florida man over the glitchy stream and one sports attorney believing several factors could lead to legal action. For those who were able to watch it, Paul won a lopsided decision to improve his record to 11-1, though he’s received plenty of flack for admitting he carried Tyson through several rounds. He walked away from the fight with a guaranteed $40 million payday while Tyson added a cool $20 million to his net worth, giving them both something to do for the next few weeks instead of strapping on the gloves: counting their boatloads of cash."

What’s more concerning for the 76ers is that Paul George suffered a hyperextension in his left knee during the second half, forcing him to leave the game and not return.  It’s worth noting that George had the same injury during the preseason, which kept him out of the first five games.  Therefore, Philadelphia can expect to exercise some caution regarding George’s availability ahead of Friday’s game against the Nets.  Interestingly, the 76ers held a team meeting before the Grizzlies game to address their poor start and air out some grievances.  Generally, that type of Kumbaya session can help galvanize a team, but it did not significantly impact Philadelphia’s results.  The 76ers sit at 2-12 entering Friday’s game, which is the worst record in the NBA. Even the Wizards and the Jazz are ahead of them at this point. Philadelphia looks fractured at the moment, and given the injuries to their star players, I suspect they haven’t had many opportunities to practice together.  Thus, getting everyone on the same page is likely to take some time.  Although the 76ers have a talented roster on paper, their current form makes them tough to trust while laying points. Philadelphia ranks dead last in offensive efficiency (104.7), while the Nets rank eighth (114.6) with Cam Thomas leading the way at 24.6 ppg.  Take the Nets and the points in this matchup.

In response to a list of Diet Coke power rankings posted on X by this reporter from The Post, the star ESPN anchor of “Monday Night Countdown” and midnight “SportsCenter” laid down the gauntlet. This reporter ranked glass bottles at the top with the caveat that there might be a bias because they’re often correlated with a high-end restaurant meal, followed by fountain drinks with elite carbonation (as you’ll typically find at McDonald’s or Chick-fil-A), then cold cans, plastic bottles poured on ice, cold plastic bottle and can poured on ice with poorly carbonated tap soda (as you’ll encounter at many bars) bringing up the rear. “Can being ahead of plastic bottle is so horribly wrong I can’t even quantify it,” Van Pelt responded. He later qualified his reasoning: “Tastes so much worse [in cans],” he wrote. “It’s bitter. Not as sweet. Don’t know why.” Van Pelt has long professed himself to be a Diet Coke aficionado.  “If Diet Coke truly is bad for you…like tumors and what not…then I should just lie down and let people throw dirt on me. ‘Cause I’m toast,” he wrote in 2011. In the contemporary thread about preferences, an X user named Thom tried to tell Van Pelt that glass was tops and cans were ahead of plastic bottles. “Your name is Tom and you have an H in it. You don’t get to tell me anything,” Van Pelt answered. Another user wrote, “Take the L Scott. Can so much better than plastic bottle.” Van Pelt was undeterred, answering, “I’m taking a sip out of this bottle – which holds more of this delicious beverage and taking the W. You dunce.” Nonetheless, Van Pelt agreed that glass bottles are outstanding. “Glass bottle is like the nostalgia of the old floor coolers. The tall, skinny bottles. Elite,” he wrote."

Television replays showed that the clock didn’t start on time after St. John’s forward Zuby Ejiofor missed the second of two free throws with 4.1 seconds left in the 22nd-ranked Johnnies’ 99-98 double overtime loss to No. 13 Baylor in the Baha Mar Hoops Championship.  It was initially deflected by RJ Luis of St. John’s, but the clock didn’t start until moments after Baylor had possession, giving Roach enough time to drain his rainbow 3-pointer at the buzzer. The officials reviewed the play, but only to make sure Roach got the shot off on time, not if the clock began appropriately. The source said the officials can review the entire play, and use a stopwatch to determine if the shot would’ve been good had the clock started when it should have and disallow the basket.  It is uncertain if Roach would’ve gotten the shot off before the horn if the clock started once Luis got his hand on the ball. He certainly would’ve had to rush more in that scenario. Asked afterwards about the clock, St. John’s coach Rick Pitino said: “I don’t know what to say, the referees didn’t do a very good job tonight.” Pitino was furious that Ejiofor was “iced” before taking his two free throws.  Baylor coach Scott Drew called for a review, thinking Ejiofor may have hit one of his players with an elbow when they fouled him, and the officials granted it. “[The official] said the coach said we elbowed [his player], which we did not do,” Pitino said. “Clear as day. It’s an unethical move. I don’t like it, but that’s not the reason we lost.”"

Eli Manning threw him the ball for Shepard’s first three years with the Giants and Jones was the passer for Shepard’s next five NFL seasons wearing Giants’ blue.  Shepard made the playoffs as a rookie in 2016 and the next time the Giants made it into the postseason, 2022, he lasted through only three games before a torn ACL ended his season.  He started only four games the next two seasons before his time with the Giants ran out. There was so much losing for Shepard with the Giants and it continues on without him, as the Giants take a 2-8 record into Sunday’s game at MetLife Stadium.  This experience with the Buccaneers gives Shepard — respected and well-liked during his stay with the Giants — a chance to see how another organization operates. “I feel like [the Giants] are a couple of pieces away from being a really good team,’’ Shepard said. “I think they have a lot of solid pieces there. When it comes to the culture and everything like that, I’ve gotten a chance to see the way things are done on a different hand but I think there could be maybe a little bit of work there.’’ The culture and everything like that? “It’s just different, in so many different ways and so many different levels,’’ he said. “When it goes down to the small things, what you can do in the building as a player, the way you’re able to communicate and be hand-in-hand with the coaches, it’s just a lot of different things I kinda picked up on being there for so long. Even down to the training staff or the weight coaches and some of the different stuff that we do here, it’s a difference. “I’m not saying the way that they do it is bad, because it’s not. It’s just different and I’ve gotten to see the other side of it.’’ Brian Daboll did not have much use for Shepard on the field in 2023 and since making the playoffs in his first year as head coach, Daboll has lost his touch, with the Giants going 8-19 the past two seasons. “I don’t think you go from being the Coach of the Year two years ago to just being a guy that can’t get the job done,’’ Shepard said. “I don’t believe that. I wish him nothing but the best. I feel like he can be a coach that can produce wins. He’s done it before and he did it early on so I don’t think you just go away from that.’’

Shepard now knows there is life after the Giants. Others in more high-profile situations have learned that as well.  Saquon Barkley is starring for the Eagles, Xavier McKinney is second in the league in interceptions for the Packers, Julian Love and Leonard Williams are starting on defense for the Seahawks.  Of all the moves that drained away talent, Shepard finds it hard to come to grips with the Giants actually letting Barkley walk out the door — directly into the arms of a division rival.  Barkley is second in the NFL in rushing with 1,137 yards. “Has he ever shown you anything different?’’ Shepard said. “Maybe the year after his injury he came back a little bit slower but he was still getting healthy. He’s the ultimate teammate, leader and obviously his style of play and what he does on the field speaks for itself.’’ That defines a player and person that is tough to give up. “For me, that’s what I think,’’ Shepard said, “to be completely honest.’’"

Kelce’s Leawood, Kansas mansion was burglarized last month while the NFL star was at Arrowhead Stadium for the Chiefs’ “Monday Night Football” game against the Saints on Oct. 7. According to police documents by the Cass County Sheriff’s Office, $20,000 in cash was taken from Kelce’s home and his back door was damaged. Police did not share that a watch was taken from Kelce’s home when the news was first reported. Kelce’s home invasion took place a day after a separate burglary at Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ Belton, Mo. estate, which occurred just after midnight on Oct. 6.  Mahomes’ pregnant wife, Brittany Mahomes and their daughter Sterling, 3, and son Bronze, 1, were not home at the time of the break-in, according to ABC News. Police believe a South American crime ring is behind both burglaries, Fox 4 in Kansas City reported on Tuesday.  The next day, the NFL sent a memo to teams alerting them of organized criminals increasingly targeting the homes of professional athletes while they are away.  It included recommendations for security measures, including telling athletes not to post on social media in real time.  The burglars are skilled in conducting research for homes they’re targeting — and sometimes posing as delivery men, maintenance workers or joggers to learn about residences, neighborhoods and security systems, according to an NFL memo obtained by ABC News. NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported the FBI is investigating the crime wave as international organized crime. The burglars are targeting items such as cash, jewelry, watches and handbags, and focusing on master bedrooms and closets, Pelissero reported, adding that they will research social media accounts and players’ families posts to make sure no one is home.

Horner, the team principal and CEO of Red Bull racing, which features three-time defending champion Max Verstappen, was accused earlier this year of sending racy text messages to a subordinate female employee of the team. Horner opened up on the saga for the first time in an interview with Daily Mail.  “What happened at the start of the year felt like a perfect storm,” Horner said. “In life, it is a great lesson that the more success you have, the more of a target you become. Anything that can be used to unsettle and destabilize you and the team and the business. What disappointed me more than anything was the steps that people went to in order to try and achieve that.” Horner was cleared of wrongdoing in a Red Bull investigation.  In the interview, he said that Halliwell was “hugely supportive.” “You just stay true to yourself and I am very fortunate that I have got a tremendous family. My wife has been unbelievable, fantastic. Your partner is always the one you share your difficulties with. She has been absolutely outstanding and hugely supportive,” Horner said. “She saw through a lot of things from having an outside perspective and it is good to have that weight and measure. It is hugely important. You learn about yourselves in times of difficulty and I was absolutely determined that we would navigate through the difficult waters.” As Verstappen has the chance to clinch his fourth straight F1 championship in Las Vegas this weekend, Horner spoke about how the controversy brought the team closer together. “In times of difficulty and when stones are being thrown, it actually galvanizes a team. I think there was an element of ‘f–k you’ from the team this year. Our people were saying ‘we are a strong team, no matter what you throw at us, bring it on,'” Horner said. “I never felt I might have to walk away. I believed in myself. I believed in the process. I trusted in the process that was scrupulously applied by the company and I just had to trust to that. When I was on the plane to Bahrain, I didn’t know whether I was going to be at the race or not,” Horner said.   “But I had to believe in the process. I have had tremendous support and backing from the shareholders and from within the company. It was actually quite emotional before the first race when I addressed the factory. I do the usual summary of the testing and what the objectives are going into the season and it was absolutely rammed.”"

In the interest of spicing up everyone’s Thanksgiving, fans on X have pleaded with the Cowboys to sign Jones after the Giants released him Friday. The Giants and Cowboys face off at 4:30 p.m. ET on Thanksgiving in a game that traditionally pulls in huge ratings. “The Dallas Cowboys have an opportunity to do the funniest thing with Daniel Jones,” former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III wrote on X. Barstool Sports’ Big Cat agreed and put the onus on the Cowboys owner to come through for America: “Jerry Jones could do the funniest thing ever and save Thanksgiving Football.” “Daniel Jones and CeeDee Lamb on the Cowboys next week,” the FanDuel Sportsbook account wrote alongside a video of Tom Brady throwing a touchdown to Randy Moss. “I don’t ask for much, universe. But this one is a big one. Cowboys QB Daniel Jones v. the Giants on Thanksgiving. PLEASE,” ESPN’s Benjamin Solak wrote. The alternative is pretty bleak with Tommy DeVito leading the 2-8 Giants against Cooper Rush and the 3-7 Cowboys. Both NFC East teams have the opportunity to add another loss (or win!) to their ledger Sunday before the Turkey Day showdown. The Cowboys entered the season with high expectations but have been a brutal disappointment and the season officially became a wasted one when starting quarterback Dak Prescott was put on injured reserve with a hamstring injury that will keep him sidelined to 2025. Dallas has turned to veteran backup Cooper Rush and have maintained loyalty to him, despite middling results and the opportunity to give former No. 3 pick Trey Lance an opportunity. While it is possible the Cowboys would have interest in Jones, the likelihood of him being the starter less than a week after his Giants release is regrettably minimal. It is also possible the Giants worked out a handshake agreement with Jones not to sign with one of the team’s rivals this season upon his release. The Giants benched Jones on Monday and demoted him to fourth-string quarterback behind DeVito, Drew Lock and the newly signed Tim Boyle. Jones has a $23 million injury clause in his contract that made it non-sensical for the team to play him at all in meaningless games, particularly after he had been demoted from starter. “Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him,” Giants owner John Mara said in a statement on Friday. “We mutually agreed that would be best for him and for the team. Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way. His handling of this situation (Thursday) exemplifies just that. We are all disappointed in how things have worked out.”"

After the Cowboys got shellacked, 34-10, at home by the Texans on Monday to fall to 3-7, star wideout CeeDee Lamb and defensive back Trevon Diggs were spotted partying in a club and apparently filming a music video. On his “Nightcap” podcast with Chad Ochocinco, Sharpe eviscerated the franchise from owner Jerry Jones on down over a lack of leadership.  “That’s why your Cowboys suck — because two of their best players, this is what they’re doing,” Sharpe told Ochocinco. “That shows you how much the game of football means to them. That told me everything I need to know! I see better than I hear.” Sharpe said that was a phrase his grandfather used to say, admonishing kids if actions did not match words. “Everybody talks about winning, but do you take the steps in order to win?” Sharpe asked. “How is partying — you got your ass kicked! I would’ve left the stadium with a bag over my head! Ain’t no way you’ll see me leaving the stadium when I got beat like that. After I’ve gotten beat like that every game! … And you do this?!  “It’s disrespectful. It’s disrespectful to the fans who pay their hard-earned money. But you know what, it couldn’t happen to a better franchise. Because all that owner do is run his mouth and talk about what they’re gonna do … And all their players do, because they take it from the owner, is run their mouth — and they ain’t won dog crap. None of them!”  Sharpe questioned who was the leader on the team, whether it’s Lamb, Diggs or quarterback Dak Prescott, whose season is over after hamstring surgery.  “They got no leaders, Ocho. That is the problem that the Cowboys have,” Sharpe said. “They’re devoid of leadership from top to bottom.”"
Sports Collectors Daily,North Carolina Family’s Inherited Collection Includes Rare Ty Cobb Card,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/north-carolina-familys-inherited-collection-includes-rare-ty-cobb-card/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 03:32:46 +0000","The Lucky 7 Find is legendary.  Now, the same dealer who brought those rare Ty Cobb cards to market has latched onto another one inside a family heirloom collection worth plenty. It’s a deal 5 years in the making.","November 21, 2024 By Rich Mueller  Call it Lucky 7 Find II. Eight and a half years after he landed one of the most memorable–and valuable– finds of vintage baseball cards this century, the longtime owner of MINT State has uncovered another Ty Cobb Tobacco branded Cobb card, along with hundreds of others from the standard T206 set.  This time, the consignment deal Rick Snyder has acquired from a North Carolina family won’t bring as big of a windfall, but the story behind it is certainly worth telling. To understand it, one has to go back a few years. It was in March of 2016 when the South Carolina-based dealer received a phone call that led him to one family’s discovery of no less than seven T206 Cobb/Cobb back cards face down in a paper bag while they cleaned out their great grandparents’ crumbling home in a rural town in the south. Sold to collectors over a period of time, they netted about $3 million. The “Cobb Tobacco” card is a close cousin of the regular T206 Cobb red portrait but the back has an add for Cobb’s own brand of tobacco and proclaims it “King of the Smoking Tobacco World.” It’s believed the cards were placed inside tins of the Hall of Famer’s short lived brand of cut plug tobacco. Only about 15 were known to exist before the discovery.  After reading about what became known as the Lucky 7 find, the North Carolina family realized their own hoard of 570 tobacco cards that had been passed down through the generations was probably worth looking into. It had been hidden away for years, all but forgotten by current family members who weren’t collectors. “Like the Lucky 7 Find, one family member was ready to throw them out and another said ‘no, no, no’,” Snyder said.   That was in 2019. The family began researching the cards, including the Cobb, and came across coverage of the original Lucky 7 Find. Snyder wasn’t that far away and they reached out, offering scans, descriptions and a history of the collection. All but one of the T206s had Piedmont or Old Mill tobacco ads on the back.  The one exception featured the rarest brand of the 16 ad backs associated with the set:  the Cobb brand.  That card–if it was authentic–would take what looked like a very nice, star packed find into a doozy. An intrigued Snyder called back. “We later learned the entire household was huddled around the phone listening and hoping,” he reported.  “The family knew they had what appeared to be an authentic collection of tobacco cards more than 110 years old, and properly identified 545 of the cards from the T206 set with 370 different, more than 70% of the complete set.” Snyder, who often sells on consignment, expressed his interest in helping the family sell the collection but nothing came of it.  Their communication from 2019 remained at the bottom of his text message history. Patience, though, can pay off.  The family contacted him again not long ago and set up a meeting. “It went from nothing for five years to ‘let’s do this now’,’ Snyder told SC Daily.  He traveled to the neighboring state to determine once and for all if  the rare prize was authentic. “As I was examining the Cobb, my consignor asked me ‘Why are you smirking?’  I confessed it was because hers was only the second family I would ever tell that their T206 Ty Cobb with the ‘Ty Cobb’ ad brand was the real deal.”  Now graded 1.5 by PSA, the Cobb back card expected to bring a six-figure price by itself.  Only 21 copies are in PSA’s population report and nine in SGC’s, making it significantly rarer than the famed T206 Honus Wagner card. Earlier this year, a Cobb back graded 2.5 by SGC sold for $432,000. A PSA 1.5 sold back in 2019 for $138,000. The entire collection had remained in the family since the cards were produced. Originally pieced together by a former employee of the American Tobacco Company, presumably someone who worked at Factory No. 25 in Virginia, the cards were given to the North Carolina family as a gift in the first half of the 20th century.  Among the cards that had called the cigar box home for all those years were numerous Hall of Famers, including Christy Mathewson, Cy Young, Tris Speaker, other Cobb cards and assorted rarities.  All carry low technical grades, mostly because because of corner wear but a look at the images of some of the the 250 cards that were submitted for grading shows many to have eye appeal that’s off the charts, with white borders and bright color.     Keeping them tucked in a box and away from the light for about 115 years or so clearly paid dividends.  “They still have a freshness to them,” Snyder said. He estimates the value of what he’s dubbed “The Factory 25 Collection” to be between $300,000 and $400,000.    MINT State will soon start selling the collection on behalf of the family, individually and in groups. About 250 of the cards were graded.   The Cobb card, of course, is the star of the show. “What makes this example so special is that it has no creases or surface wrinkles, typically found on the vast majority of the Cobb with Cobb back,” Snyder remarked. “The card also displays nearly perfect centering on both the front and back.  Extraordinary eye appeal for the PSA 1.5 grade.”   Oh, and that original find from 2016?  The family from the small town later uncovered an eighth Cobb.  Of the 21 reviewed by PSA over the last 30 years or so, Snyder has now submitted nine of them. It’s safe to say the original Lucky 7 Cobb Find is one that won’t be duplicated but being able to sell a fresh copy of one of collecting’s truly rare cards in 2024 is certainly something Snyder wasn’t anticipating. “I guess lightning can and does strike the same place twice.” Rich is the editor and founder of Sports Collectors Daily.

The set being offered by Heritage Auctions is the best one on PSA's Registry.","November 21, 2024 By Bob D'Angelo  The 1930s saw the Goudey Gum Company produce some iconic cards of baseball stars. North of the border, Canadian-based World Wide Gum produced a similar version, but with several key differences. A complete, 96-card set of the 1934 World Wide Gum set, commonly called the “Canadian Goudey,” is part of Heritage Auctions’ Winter Sports Catalog Auction that runs from Dec. 5 to Dec. 7. What makes this set  — catalogued as V354 — so special is that it is the No. 1 All-Time Finest set on the PSA registry. Bidding for the set has already reached $50,000; figure in the 20% buyer’s premium and the top bid is actually $60,000. Heritage Auctions will announce whether the reserve for this item has been met on Dec. 2.  The World Wide Gum set is much rarer than the ’34 Goudey issue.  PSA has graded fewer than 1,800 World Wide Gum cards to date, compared to more than 27,000 Goudeys.  The 1934 World Wide Gum set combines elements of the 1933 and ’34 Goudey designs. The first 48 cards in the set mirror the 1933 Goudey/World Wide Gum design on the front, while cards 49 through 96 are carbon copies of the 1934 set, complete with the “Lou Gehrig Says …” intro. The 1934 set was the final time that World Wide Gum used color on its card fronts. It had white borders and colorful, artistic renditions of the players. The card backs are bilingual, with type in both English and French. They measured 2 3/8 inches by 2 7/8 inches.  The set has some of the biggest names in baseball, and one that was missing from the 1934 Goudey issue — Babe Ruth. Although the Bambino had four cards in the 1933 Goudey set, he had none in the 1934 offering. His 1934 World Wide Gum card uses the same design of the No. 53 card in the ’33 Goudey set. The only difference is the back, with its bilingual type. In the World Wide Gum set, key cards include Ruth (No. 28), Gehrig (No. 92), Rogers Hornsby (No. 1), Dizzy Dean (No. 55) and Jimmie Foxx (No. 58). The set offered in the Heritage Auctions sale includes five cards with a PSA 9 grade, albeit one with a qualifier. Eighteen cards have PSA 8 grades, including Hall of Famers Hornsby, Earle Combs (No. 32), Jesse Haines (No. 44) and an off-center Red Ruffing (No. 48). The largest group of graded cards are 34 PSA 7s, which feature Hall of Famers Ruth,, Dean, Foxx, Rabbit Maranville (No. 4), Herb Pennock (No. 16), Tris Speaker (No. 29) and Charlie Gehringer (No. 57), which is spelled “Charley” in the set. There are 22 cards graded at PSA 6, including Hall of Famers Frank Frisch (No. 64), Leo Durocher (No. 69) and Luke Appling (No. 84). Nine cards are in EX (PSA 5) condition, with Cooperstown enshrines Mickey Cochrane (No. 59), Heinie Manush (No. 68) and Carl Hubbell (No. 71) featured. There are seven PSA 4 cards, highlighted by Hall of Famers Gehrig, Bill Terry (No. 53), Lefty Grove (No. 54), Chick Hafey (No. 78) and Ernie Lombardi (No. 82). Ruth, Gehrig, Dean and Hornsby are the most coveted cards in the set. Ruth was declining as a star but still hit 34 home runs and had 104 RBI in 1933. His numbers fell to 22 homers and 84 RBI in 1934, his final season with the New York Yankees. Gehrig was at his peak in 1934, winning the Triple Crown with 49 home runs and 166 RBI while hitting .363. Dean had his greatest season in 1934, winning 30 games and two more in the World Series as the St. Louis Cardinals soared as baseball’s best that year. Hornsby, meanwhile, was a player-manager in 1934 for the St. Louis Browns, who went 67-85 and finished in sixth place.

Sports Collectors Daily,Injury Delays but Shouldn’t Derail Market for Alex Ovechkin Cards,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/alex-ovechkin-most-watched-hockey-cards/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 01:39:30 +0000","Despite his recent injury, Alex Ovechkin's chase for the Wayne Gretzky's all-time goals record is adding excitement to the hockey card market.  Jeff Morris also takes us back to the start of his career, when he was trying to get the hang of signing autographs.","November 21, 2024 By Jeff Morris  As if the Canada Post strike that removed thousands of Canadian buyers and sellers from online auctions wasn’t a big enough blow to the hockey card market this week. The most anticipated moment of the 2024-25 NHL season took a hit when Jack McBain of the Utah Hockey Club and Alex Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals met in an ugly knee-on-knee collision that left Ovechkin in a crumpled heap on the ice. Alex Ovechkin is slow to get up after colliding knee-to-knee with Jack McBain. pic.twitter.com/gQNOiDMcPR — Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) November 19, 2024  Suddenly, the excitement of Ovie breaking Wayne Gretzky’s once-thought untouchable career goal scoring record was put into doubt. Tom Wilson of the Capitals “sorted things out” with McBain, instantly christened as the Jeff Gillooly of the NHL. Unfortunately, fans took things too far, as McBain received death threats on social media.  Ovechkin is now expected to be out 4-6 weeks with a broken bone in his leg. He was on a tear in the early season, with an NHL-leading 15 goals in 18 games. He had five in two games before he went down. It was a given that Ovechkin was going to break Gretzky’s record this season. He is 27 goals behind Gretzky’s total of 894. Because of Ovechkin’s slow start last season, there were some doubts. But then, in the second half of the season, Ovechkin was lighting it up. At every single sports card show or shop where hockey cards are sold, it has been the same conversation every day for more than a year. Clearly, the answer, even after the injury, is yes. And if he’s able to get back onto the ice is less time than we feared when he went down, the next question is can he score 1,000 career goals? It sounds unrealistic. So did the thought of him ever catching Gretzky’s 894. If he finishes this season with more than 900 goals, which he should, he might be three 30-goal seasons away from a thousand. Based on how good he is at 39, why not? There is no reason to think he can’t score 40 goals at the ages of 40 and 41. Ovechkin in the sports card market is interesting. Having talked to a number of dealers and collectors, the take on Ovie is pretty consistent. Getting an Ovechkin autograph, low serial-numbered card or memorabilia card is a premium hit. But he doesn’t really drive sales of new product. His cards will be very strong on the secondary market, but no shop owners are stocking extra product because of him. Having said that, if there is an Upper Deck product with limited Gretzky autographs, box demand will spike. Connor Bedard single-handedly made the hockey market hot last year. One question that younger collectors who weren’t around when Gretzky was in his prime will often ask is if the Great 8 is more collectible than the Great One. Simply put, no. Gretzky, Gordie Howe and Bobby Orr, are in a class by themselves in the card market. But the current hobby trifecta of Ovechkin, Sidney Crosby and Connor McDavid are knocking at the door to join that Mount Rushmore of hockey cards. Connor Bedard is an entirely different discussion. But that doesn’t mean Ovechkin isn’t hot. In fact, his cards have been scorching hot.  In the month of November, more than 2,300 of his cards have changed hands on eBay. Add in shows, shops, Facebook groups, Whatnot and every other popular selling platform and you’ve got a load of Ovie. On October 30, a PSA 10 Ovechkin 2005-06 Upper Deck Authenticated autographed RC numbered to 999 sold for $13,100. Thirteen Ovechkin cards have sold for over $4,000 on eBay in the last 30 days. You can check out a current list of the most watched auctions for his cards below. If you look at the various Ovechkin rookie cards from the 2005-06 season, you will notice that the signatures vary from card to card. The signature on the Xcitement card is significantly different that the others. Also, if you take a look at all of the autographs from that year, you will see a range of different Ovechkin autographs. There is a simple explanation for it. The first time I met Alex Ovechkin was in Raleigh at the 2004 NHL Draft. He was the number one overall pick that year. I was a VP at Pacific, and we were a sponsor of the draft and the title sponsor of the hockey card and memorabilia show at the event. I met him in the photo room we had set up. Minutes after he was drafted, he came into our photo room and we took his pictures for hockey cards that ended up never being made. The lockout would cancel the 2004-05 season, and we were eventually told by the NHLPA that when play resumed, we would not longer have a license. They were giving the Upper Deck Company an exclusive deal. Ovechkin, at that time, spoke no English. It only makes sense that if he could not speak English, he could not write English. I always thought that the Xcitement autograph was some form of cursive writing in the Cryllic alphabet. I only know a few words of Russian and am not very good with their alphabet, so it’s hard to tell. Embed from Getty Images Here is something about Ovechkin that day that you may not know. His mother was with him, and she had a lot of say in his business dealings at that time. No, he’s not a mama’s boy at all. His mother, Tatyana, is the greatest Soviet basketball player of all time. She spoke some English. I told her that I had actually met her when I was 12 years old during the 1976 Montreal Olympics. I was able to go to all of the basketball games at the Forum, as my father and uncle worked the games as a photographer. While they shot games or were in the press box, I was either sitting by myself watching the game or running film. Between games one day, I went to the McDonald’s across the street. The entire Soviet women’s team came in and they all had Big Macs. It was right in the middle of the famous Big Mac Attack ad campaign. It was the first time the women had ever been to a McDonald’s. Tatyana Ovechkina sat at the table beside me. As nervous as a I was as a 12-year-old, I smiled and said hi. I had a Soviet media guide and she signed it for me, as did a few of her teammates. That media guide was among the casualties of the 1998 ice storm that destroyed much of my childhood collection. If you are wondering why that rabbit hole I just took you on is relevant, it’s because Tatyana wore number 8 throughout her long and storied career. Alex Ovechkin wears number 8 as a tribute to him mother. Embed from Getty Images Since Alex now speaks English very well, his signature is consistent. When I see his autograph and the number 8, I always think of being a 12-year-old eating a Big Mac at the St Catherines Street McDonald’s across from the Forum and getting the autograph of Ovechkin’s mom. Hockey fans are somewhat divided. There are some diehard Gretzky collectors and fans that don’t want Ovechkin to break the record. Goals aside, it’s very unlikely Ovechkin will challenge Gretzky’s points record. The feel good part of the chase, however, is that Gretzky is supporting Ovechkin and cheering him on. Gretzky says it’s great for the game. Gretzky said in an NHL.com article written by Tom Gulitti that Ovechkin breaking the career goals record was inevitable. “It’s just a matter of time, whether it’s late this year, early next year, whenever,” Gretzky told Gulitti. “I mean, he’s a great player. He’s a great goal scorer.” Gretzky was a different player than Ovechkin is. Gretzky was a playmaker, while Ovechkin is a pure shooter. “Look at guys like Brett Hull, Mario Lemieux, Mike Bossy,” Gretzky said. “They get those opportunities. They don’t miss the net. If you miss the net you can’t score. Ovi. Bossy. Jari Kurri. Brett Hull. They never miss the net. And that separates a great goal scorer from good goal scorers, right? “And he can be in any spot on the ice, he’s going to hit the net.” Ovechkin’s rival throughout his career, Sidney Crosby, is among the many current players pulling for Ovechkin to break the record. In the same article, Ovechkin predictably said that at his age, it’s about staying healthy enough to score goals. He added that the focus is on winning another Stanley Cup, not on the goals record. But he is humbled that Gretzky is cheering him on and he might talk to him more when he gets close to the record about how to handle the pressure. “If that kind of person is rooting for me, it’s pretty cool stuff,” Ovechkin told Gulitti. “He’s the best player out there and he’s a great human. He supports me and it’s a pretty cool thing.” Clearly, in the last 20 years, Alex Ovechkin has learned to speak English and sign his autograph very well.

Sometimes a nice week at the mailbox can re-energize your pen, as this weekend I dropped 14 request letters in the mailbox. Hopefully I’ll be able to send a few more before the end of the year, though I’ll come up well short of my goal of 300. Here are some recent returns. Espen Knutsen  Almost 22 years ago, I started working on getting the 2002-03 Topps Total hockey card set signed. With Knutsen’s arrival, I am down to only three cards left on the set– Paul Kariya, Mark Messier, and Jason Allison. The light at the end of the tunnel shines just a little brighter. Knutsen signed this via his home address in Norway in two and a half months. Paul Kariya  Kariya has never been known to be a good TTMer– or even a good in-person signer. Most attempts in-person would get ignored, and for decades any attempts by mail resulted in an auto-penned photo being sent back. But a year ago I saw someone say he got a success via the Hockey Hall of Fame, so I sent one off myself. A year later, I got back this 1998-99 Pacific card signed– more on that below. This took exactly a year and a day, sent to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Jim Strickland  Any week where you get two set hits is great. Strickland pitched for the Twins and Indians in the 1970s. He shares a 1972 Topps high number card with Vic Albury and Rick Dempsey. After getting Dempsey on it, I mailed off to Strickland as well. Albury unfortunately died in 2017, so this is as complete as this one will get. Jim signed this for me in a month via his California home. Ruminations on success, failure, and areas in between
I was once asked at age 15 during a church “Coming Of Age” class (basically confirmation for the Unitarian Universalist world): what does success mean? What does it look like? What is it? I couldn’t really define it well then and at 40 I still don’t know. But in the TTM world it seems pretty cut and dried: success is sending a letter and getting an autograph back. But this week’s autograph from Paul Kariya has made me question that simple definition: are there tiers of success? As you saw above in my Espen Knutsen info, Kariya is one I have left in my Topps Total set. And I mailed that card– and only that card– in my request to him. He or whoever handles his mail sent the card back unsigned and put in a signed 1998-99 Pacific card in its place. Why players do this sometimes I don’t understand but they do.  I have never been that close to getting the card I need signed from a tough signer and just barely coming up short. I hate sounding spoiled here. After all, I got an autograph from a tough-to-get Hall of Famer, and he returned my unused SASE and paid his own Canadian postage, so I saved some money as well. But when you have a goal and you get agonizingly close and come up short, you wonder if you had a really good failure, or a bad success. It’s like asking a player to sign a ball, or a puck, or a photo and getting it smeared. Sure it’s a success, but… How close will I ever get again? Do I just need to mail off every year until it gets done or doesn’t come back at all? On the overall spectrum of success-to-failure, this is on the better end, for sure. But still… the pain! Maybe I’ll get lucky and someone working on a signed 1998-99 Pacific set needs this and has a Topps Total to trade me. It seems unlikely but hey, why not dream?

As we reported last week, the multi-page paper, not surprisingly, was focused on sports, with Robinson chronicling the history and development of baseball, football and hockey.   Completed while Robinson was a UCLA student, it was purchased years ago from the estate of long-time UCLA assistant football coach A.J. Sturzenegger and was being offered at auction for the first time.  The final price, including an 18% buyer’s premium, was just above the pre-sale estimate. Among the other items sold in the auction were a completely graded 1956 Topps baseball set with each card rated 6 or better ($25,960) and a 1932 US Caramel Babe Ruth graded 1.5 by SGC ($12,390). —–  Bidding for the 1933 Goudey Babe Ruth graded PSA 8.5 is set to end Friday night.   No other examples of #149–one of four Ruth cards in the set–have been graded higher. The card appears well on its way to crossing the seven-figure mark via Fanatics Collect’s Premier Auction, which includes about 100 vintage and modern cards. —– A dozen lots of Connor McDavid game-used items are on the block at MeiGray Auctions. Among the items are the CCM helmet with Oakley shield McDavid was wearing when he recorded his 50th and 100th points of the 2022-23 NHL season.  The navy blue helmet has been photomatched to a total of 13 games played between October of 2022 and March of last season.  Others date to last season and include the game-used skates and puck from the assist that marked his 100th point and the stick from his 80th assist, photo matched to two games. A pair of pants worn across parts of two seasons and game-worn socks are also part of the auction that runs until Dec. 5. MeiGray offers regular auctions of memorabilia from McDavid, who recently scored the 1,000th point of his career. —– Vintage set breaks continue to be popular with some collectors.  The concept is similar to a modern break:  buy a spot and a random draw determines the card(s) you get.  Justin Farber of T206Cards.com says in addition to selling cards outright, his two-year-old company has already conducted 12 1986-87 Fleer basketball breaks, eight 1953 Topps baseball breaks and six of both 1955 and ’56 Topps sets, among others.  Some breaks are designed around high-end sets like T206 or high value cards from multiple sets. —– A group of collectors is celebrating five years of raising money for a children’s charity during the  holiday season.  Since 2000, the Facebook Vintage Wax and Packs group has raised over $23,000 through items donated and placed for sale on the group page.  Last year alone, they raised over $8,000 for The John Theissen Children’s Foundation (JTCF), a non-profit that helps sick and underprivileged children in the New York area. This year, they’re hoping to raise $10,000. They’re asking for donation commitments of vintage unopened items worth at least $100. The items are then offered for sale on the group’s page. Once sold, the person who made the donation ships the item to the buyer.  Those who donate are asked to provide photos with a recommended selling price. A tax receipt is available to all donors once your item is sold.  Those who would like to donate can reach out to Dave Eisenberg at [email protected]. —– If you’re a little new to the hobby and/or the whole grading thing, you might check out some tips on sports card grading that our friends at Just Collect have put together.

Sports Collectors Daily,Freddie Freeman’s World Series Walk-Off Home Run Ball Lands at SCP Auctions,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/freddie-freeman-world-series-grand-slam-ball/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 18:47:55 +0000","A ten-year-old fan who thought he was going to the dentist wound up helping his dad snare Freddie Freeman's World Series walk-off home run ball.  Now, that one-of-a-kind souvenir is heading for the auction block, where it's expected to bring a huge price.","November 20, 2024 By Rich Mueller  A family’s trip to Game 1 of the 2024 World Series came with an unexpected bonus:  the baseball Freddie Freeman hit for the first ever World Series game-ending grand slam home run.  Now, that piece of history is about to find a new home. They’ve consigned the ball to Southern California-based SCP Auctions, where it will be offered as part of a “December Dynasty” auction of historical artifacts that’s set to take place next month. Freeman came to the plate with the Dodgers trailing the New York Yankees 3-2 in the bottom of the tenth. He swung at the first pitch from Nestor Cortes and belted it into the right field bleachers at Dodger Stadium where ten-year-old Zachary Ruderman and his father Nico corralled it.  “There was a huge scramble for it and I knocked it to my dad, who came up with it and then held it up in the air,” Zack told ABC 7 the next day.  His parents had told the young Dodger fan that he was going to have his braces removed but instead steered the car to the ballpark for the series opener.   Now, instead of having just a fun story to tell, they’ll land a pretty nice check, too.  SCP expects the ball to sell for a seven-figure price tag.  “We’re honored to handle this baseball memento from a moment that will forever be remembered in sports history,” remarked SCP Auctions President David Kohler.  “Our family hopes the baseball will be displayed in Dodgers stadium so all Dodgers and baseball fans can view a very special piece of history for the City of Los Angeles,” the Ruderman family said Wednesday in a statement.     The Freeman ball is set to be offered on the heels of the record-breaking sale of Shohei Ohtani’s 50th home run ball of the 2024 regular season, which made him the first player ever to have 50 home runs and 50 steals in a season. That ball sold for $4.3 million last month. The home run bore some parallels to another famous Dodger Stadium World Series homer–a game-winning walk-off hit by a gimpy Kirk Gibson off Dennis Eckersley of the A’s in 1988.  SCP sold Gibson’s bat and other items after he consigned them to auction in 2010. Freeman would go on to be named World Series MVP by leading Los Angeles to a 4 games to 1 victory over New York.  “It might be the greatest baseball moment I’ve ever witnessed,” said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after Freeman’s homer. “And I’ve witnessed some great ones.” Freeman’s bat and jersey from Game 1 are already on display at Dodger Stadium.

Sports Collectors Daily,1970 Venezuelan Baseball Card Set Connects With Off-Season Topps Players,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/off-season-topps-connections-with-1970-ovenca-venezuelan-baseball-card-set/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 01:55:38 +0000","You'll recognize quite a few names inside this 1970 baseball card set distributed in Venezuela and meant to be pasted into an album.  Roy Carlson found a set on Facebook and digs into the players, the photos, the errors and much more.","November 19, 2024 By Roy Carlson  As a midwestern kid in the 1970’s, nothing topped buying Topps wax packs at the beginning of spring as another baseball season entered my young life.  I continued snapping up more and more packs through the summer months, thumbing through each stack hoping for fresh faces, preferably Chicago Cubs, to stare back at me.  Unlike many of my friends, I didn’t grow disinterested in those cards as other activities heated up, like the return to school, scouts and football.  But, alas, eventually the baseball campaign ended and the agonizing wait until next spring began.  It never once occurred to me back then that some of those heroes in my Topps collection headed south, way south, to Venezuela to compete in Winter League ballgames.  Nor did I realize that baseball cards existed beyond the south (and north) border of the United States.  Topps produced Venezuelan sets during this time period, as Jason Schwartz thoroughly recaps in this SABR article and veteran hobby writer George Vrechek marvelously covers here. A few months ago, I bought a 300-card 1970 Venezuelan set commonly referred to as Ovenca, the editor listed in the album that holds the beisbol cards.  Mind you, this was not a product created by Topps, but to me, Ovenca and Topps cards intersect in many ways, as I’ll point out later in this article.  As was common practice with trading cards in Latin America, most Ovenca cards were lightly glued into a paper album, partially or entirely concealing the cards’ backside Spanish descriptions.  My 54-year-old Beisbol ’70 Album has obviously seen better days, but the rich history and stories the cards hold more than make up for the rough condition.   The collection features six Winter League teams – Tigers de Aragua (Tigers), Cardenales de Lara (Cardinals), Magallanes Navegantes (Navigators), Leones del Caracas (Lions), Aguilas del Zulia (Eagles), Tiburones de La Guaira (Sharks), each with 40 cards.  The remaining 60 cards are spread over Veteranos players (Veterans), Inmortales (Immortals, i.e. deceased) and miscellaneous action & team cards.    One of the League’s stadiums, El Stadium Universitario in Caracas, is featured on card #106.  The 30,000-seat capacity venue, built in 1950, can be seen in the background on multiple cards throughout the set.  This gorgeous vintage postcard shows how the ballpark, which is still in existence today, nestles into a mix of city skyline and mountainous terrain.  According to super collector Chris Shuchart, most cards feature a flat finish front and dull blue back on thick cardboard, though there are some rare cards with a glossy front and brighter blue back printed on thinner stock.   Sport Grafico, the local magazine akin to Sports Illustrated, published ads promoting the full color 1970 Beisbol trading cards and album.  According to a pricing description in Venezuelan currency found on the bottom left of the promo ad in the Sport Grafico 11/20/70 issue, an album cost 1 bolivar and 3 cards in an envelope set you back .25 bolivar.  To learn more about Sport Grafico magazine and some Venezuelan paper cards associated with it, hobby researcher Matthew Glidden does a great job capturing details in part one and part two on his blog. I came across this magnificent 1970 photo in Sport Grafico of a Venezuelan boy playing with his beisbol cards.  The image is a throwback to my own life as I did the same thing with Topps cards on my bedroom floor.  I was curious what the copy on the left described about the picture.  Thanks to Google Translate, I typed in the Spanish words and out spit a fairly accurate English interpretation.  To my surprise, the Christmas story told of the extreme challenges a boy like this faced in Venezuela.  Yet the cards provided both escape and hope to help combat his difficult life circumstances, as highlighted below.  To offset that sobering reflection, let’s move on to the joy of Topps/Ovenca card connections. There are a few top-notch names in the 1970 Ovenca set.  Native crowd favorite Luis Aparicio is the biggest superstar included, but another Venezuelan, fresh-faced David Concepion gives Aparicio stiff competition.  Concepcion’s Big Red Machine years with Cincinnati were just starting to bud while Little Louie was winding down his Hall of Fame career.  Clarence Gaston, who enjoyed his strongest playing career performance in 1970 in the States with the San Diego Padres, and the great Luis Tiant, joined the star card line-up.  Here are their Topps counterparts around the same time period.  While they’re not Topps cards, it’s still cool to see 19 Ovenca pure “pre-rookie” cards of players who had yet to be featured on a Topps base card product.  There are five players featured in the 1970 Ovenca assemblage that also have Topps cards appearing in the 1950’s.  The oldest Topps card belongs to Chico Carrasquel, who landed in the rare 1951 Blue Back set, Topps’ first year on the scene.  Camilo Pascual, Aparicio, Ray Monzant and Orlando Pena followed suit during that decade.      For all you 1969 Seattle Pilots fans, if you haven’t done so already, here’s your chance to add to your stash five trading cards of South America-bound Pilot players that landed right around the time the team packed up the tent.   I found it interesting that some bloodlines of Topps players were shared within the Ovenca set.  Aparicio’s pop, the elder Luis, garners his own card.  The father/son duo were even identified as padre/hijo in the album.  Pompeyo Davalillo, much older brother of Venezuelan Victor, commonly referred to as Vic in the U.S., hang together within the Ovenca set.  Veteran Pelayo Chacon joins his son, Elio.  Elio suited up for the brand-new, hapless 1962 New York Mets.  His Venezuelan roots contributed to some miscues during that ineffective season, as reported by baseball-reference.com:  Who knew long-time MLB ace Camilo Pascual’s nickname was “Patato Pequeno”?  When I saw his older brother Carlos “Patato” Pascual in the Ovenca set, I looked up how the nicknames came to be.  Peter C. Bjarkman writes on SABR BioProject:  Carrasquel, portrayed with his nickname “Chico” on the fronts of his six Topps base cards, is shown with his formal first name Alfonso on his international cards.  His Uncle Alejandro, the first Venezuelan to ever play in the Majors, makes an Ovenca cameo alongside his nephew.  As neat as that linkage is, here’s one even better for nostaglic collectors like myself.  That same Alejandro Carrasquel card is sitting on the floor of that boy’s stockpile 54 years ago.  Simply wonderful. Speaking of nicknames, the Ovenca set sheds light on legal names of some Major Leaguers when compared to typed names on some Topps card fronts.  For instance, Topps lettered either “Chico” or “Leo” on all 16 Topps base card fronts for Leonardo Cardenas.  Topps did unmask Cardenas’ full first name on some card backs, like this 1970 model:  In Venezuela, Ovenca listed Boots Day as Charles, whereas Topps opted for Boots on the front of his complete 1970-1974 card run.  In addition to some card backs, sometimes Topps divulged a player’s birth name using the athlete’s facsimile signature.  A fair share of confusion hovers over this next player’s moniker.  Ovenca called him Jesus Marcano Trillo while Topps called him Manny Trillo.  Regarding the talented infielder’s name, Leonte Landino provides the dope on SABR BioProject:  Topps covered all bases by listing not only Manny Trillo on the 1974 rookie card front (above), but also Jesus Manuel Marcano Trillo on the back (below).  Here’s a case of mistaken identity.  Ovenca got pitcher Jerry Cram right on his card and album #236 listing, but another Stateside hurler sharing the same first name was not as fortunate.  When pasting Jerry Crider’s beisbol card #192 into the collector book, one might do a double take seeing Cram’s name instead of Crider’s.  I wonder how many times this happened in the winter of 1970-1971?  Topps avoided the problem altogether by not issuing albums for their U.S. pasteboards.  On top of the Crider album inaccuracy, there were a handful of boo-boos on Ovenca cards for the Topps visitors.      INCORRECT OVENCA CARD SPELLINGS:       CORRECT TOPPS COMPANION CARD SPELLINGS:       INCORRECT OVENCA CARD SPELLINGS:       CORRECT TOPPS COMPANION CARD SPELLINGS:  Another American player that encountered a botched name on his foreign card is Kurt Bevacqua, which may have burst his bubble upon seeing it for the first time.  Ovenca produced a multi-player headshot card titled EL PODER NEGRO, Spanish for BLACK POWER of four players – Clarence Gaston, Hal King, Jim Holt and Herman Hill.  Each appeared on vintage Topps cards.  Hill’s lone Topps appearance was his 1970 rookie card shared with catcher Paul Ratliff.  The Twins outfielder died tragically on December 14, 1970 in the Caribbean Sea off the northern coast of Venezuela.  He was only 25 years old.  Dana Yost recaps Hill’s life and death in this SABR Bio Project. In addition to the shared Ovenca card #107, Hill had a stand-alone card #110 in the 1970 Venezuelan set.  Rather than end this article on a somber note, let’s switch gears and take a quick looksee at moundsman Fred Norman.  Here he is sportin’ nearly identical expressions on his 1970 Topps and Ovenca cards, but lookin’ much cooler down south with a five o’clock shadow and shades.  Lowell Palmer, you got competition.    Despite this 1970 Venezuelan baseball card set having no official Topps affiliation, there’s still a gratifying collecting kinship for me with the players of that era, and perhaps for you, too.  I created a sortable Excel spreadsheet that helps navigate through the 300 non-domestic cards.

Sports Collectors Daily,Curse Breaker: Collection Of Former Red Sox CEO Larry Lucchino Headed To Auction,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/curse-breaker-collection-of-former-red-sox-ceo-larry-lucchino-headed-to-auction/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 01:29:25 +0000",He oversaw the championship revival of the Boston Red Sox and now dozens of items from the collection of Larry Lucchino are going on the auction block with all proceeds going to charity.,"November 19, 2024 By Bob D'Angelo  Larry Lucchino was once characterized as Earl Weaver in a suit – without the vocabulary. Lucchino, who died in April at the age of 78, was just as aggressive as the Earl of Baltimore and had the same passion for winning. As president and CEO of the Boston Red Sox, he oversaw three World Series titles and helped Boston overcome the Curse of the Bambino.  He was a philanthropist and collector, and more than 200 lots of his sports memorabilia will be offered online by Bonhams Skinner in an auction that begins on Nov. 23. The Massachusetts-based auction house labeled the sale “Curse Breaker: The Collection of Larry Lucchino.” It will be selling the 2004 World Series ring that was awarded to Lucchino after the Red Sox ended an 86-year championship drought in 2004 — a run to the title that included a comeback from a 3-0 deficit in the ALCS against their hated rival, the New York Yankees. it’s expected to sell for $50,000-$75,000. Other items include a Red Sox Tiffany & Co. Commissioner Trophy from the 2004 season (est. $40,000-$60,000) and the third base bag used in Game 4 of the World Series, when Boston completed a four-game sweep against the St. Louis Cardinals. Series-clinching bases from 2007 and 2013 are also in the online catalog. Another item of note is a 2004 Fenway Park championship banner owned by Lucchino. The sale will also include memorabilia from the Red Sox championship teams of 2007 and 2012. Vintage items will feature a pair of Fenway Park grandstand seats installed in 1934, and a “Gate L” double-sided sign from Fenway. “My brother, Larry, embodied the spirit of generosity,” Lucchino’s brother, Frank J. Lucchino, said in a news release. “In his honor, The Lucchino Family Foundation was established to continue his legacy of giving. I am proud to say that all proceeds from this auction will benefit The Lucchino Family Foundation, ensuring that his commitment to supporting worthy charities throughout New England lives on.” Larry Lucchino, a three-time cancer survivor, was a chairman for the Boston-based Jimmy Fund during the last eight years of his life. Through his efforts, the Jimmy Fund — the favorite charity of Hall of Famer Ted Williams — raised more than $167 million for cancer treatment and research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Lucchino joined the Red Sox in 2002, but his influence in baseball began decades before that. The Pittsburgh native played in the backcourt for two Ivy League champions at Princeton, including the 1965 squad captained by Bill Bradley that reached the Final Four. After attending law school at Yale University, Lucchino worked on the House Judiciary Committee that investigated the Watergate scandal during the early 1970s. Lucchino got his first taste of professional sports when he began working for Washington attorney Edward Bennett Williams, who owned the Baltimore Orioles and the NFL’s Washington franchise. Lucchino owned five World Series rings. In addition to the 2004, ’07 and ’13 jewelry, he also was awarded a ring after the Red Sox won the 2018 World Series. He earned his first ring when the Orioles won the 1983 World Series and was the team president from 1988 to 1993. He also earned a Super Bowl ring when Washington won Super Bowl XVII in 1983 and was awarded a Final Four watch with Princeton in 1965. Two items from Lucchino’s association with championship teams from 1983 will be part of the auction — his NFC championship ring he won with Washington, and his World Series ring he earned with Baltimore. After his tenure in Baltimore, Lucchino was president and a minority owner of the San Diego Padres from 1995 to 2001. The Padres advanced to the World Series in 1998 but were swept by the Yankees. Lucchino’s National League champions ring that he won with the Padres in 1998 is also part of the sale. One of Lucchino’s enduring legacies was his effort to create retro baseball parks. He and baseball stadium architect Janet Marie Smith led the effort to replace Baltimore’s antiseptic Memorial Stadium with Camden Yards. That ties in neatly with the Bonhams Skinner auction, as a group of four seats from Camden Yards will be up for sale. Lucchino would also spearhead efforts to bring a new ballpark for the Padres, as the city replaced Qualcomm Stadium with Petco Park in downtown San Diego. And instead of scrapping historic Fenway Park, Lucchino helped guide the massive renovation of the ballpark. That included seats on top of the Green Monster and a new right-field pavilion section. That also paved the way for his induction into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2016. “Larry Lucchino’s lasting impact on the Boston Red Sox and Major League Baseball as a whole is undeniable,” Robin Starr, the general manager of Bonhams Skinner, said in the news release. “It is incredibly exciting and an honor as a long-time Boston-based auction house to be able to present these important pieces of baseball history.” Highlights of the collection will be available for viewing in Boston at Bonhams Skinner from Dec. 2-4.

SportsLogos.Net News,‘As Maine As Possible’: Portland Hearts of Pine Unveil Kits for Inaugural USL League One Season,https://news.sportslogos.net/2024/11/21/as-maine-as-possible-portland-hearts-of-pine-unveil-kits-for-inaugural-usl-league-one-season/soccer/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 01:25:00 +0000","The woods and the water of Maine come together in the new primary jerseys for Portland Hearts of Pine, who will make their debut in USL League One in March 2025.

Janet Mills, at a special event at the","The woods and the water of Maine come together in the new primary jerseys for Portland Hearts of Pine, who will make their debut in USL League One in March 2025. The jerseys were unveiled in front of 1,500 supporters, including Gov. Janet Mills, at a special event at the State Theater in Portland on the evening of Thursday, November 21. Hearts of Pine executive creative director Burke Cherrie, who co-designed the kits with club founder Gabe Hoffman-Johnson, told SportsLogos.net in an interview just hours before the reveal that the club was aiming for a timeless design that people across Maine would be proud to wear. “Mainers, in particular, like the old ways. There’s a convergence of the old ways and the new ways here,” Cherrie said. “We don’t discard the past. That’s something that really resonated throughout the branding process. In town halls with supporters and local government officials, talking with people who run businesses, there was a desire for this to be as Maine as possible. And history and heritage are a key part of that.” The jersey features navy blue and forest green hoops all over the front, back and sleeves to represent the Atlantic Ocean and the woods that Mainers interact with every day, either for recreation or to earn a living. The sleeve cuffs and polo collar are navy blue with red trim inspired by the heart in the club’s crest. The club motto, “Lead With Your Heart,” and Dirigo heart logo — a mashup of their heart iconography and the “Dirigo star” from the Maine flag — appear on the back collar. “We’ve been working on the [kit] design for really over a year. As we were developing the crest and everything else that went into the brand, the jersey design was front and center in that process,” Cherrie said. “Gabe and I are lifelong soccer fans, and there’s a lot of nostalgia for ’90s soccer culture, from when we were growing up,” he added. “I have a lot of great memories of long-sleeved jerseys and big collars and cuffs. A soccer jersey is performance wear, but it’s also fashion in today’s world. To bring back some of those trends, we felt there was an opportunity to lean into that.” The front-of-shirt sponsor is Visit Maine, the state’s tourism office, and their logo of the state’s name with a period appears in white. The sleeve sponsor is L.L.Bean, the outdoor clothing and equipment retailer based in Maine. “I would argue we have the best front-of-shirt and sleeve sponsorship combo in American soccer, and probably the world,” Cherrie said. “I don’t think you can find a European club or a South American club that has a more unified club brand aligned with its sponsors’ brands. That’s a credit to the team that’s been working on sponsorships, the commercial side of things, to bring that to life.” The kits are manufactured by Danish sportswear company Hummel, who also produce kits for Denmark’s national teams as well as German Bundesliga team Werder Bremen; Spanish La Liga clubs UD Las Palmas, Real Betis and RC Celta de Vigo; and French Ligue 1 side AS Saint-Étienne. “It’s a small world, and I’m fortunate to have friends on the other side of the table,” said Cherrie, who has worked in sports media for more than a decade, collaborating with high-profile European clubs like Liverpool and Chelsea in the past. “I’m a huge soccer fan, and my dad was obsessed with the 1992 Danish national team that wore Hummel. The chevrons and the history that’s gone into that 100-year-old brand, that always felt like a really good fit for us. And they really align with the culture of Maine; it’s a brand that punches above its weight.” Portland Hearts of Pine will kick off its 2025 USL League One season at Fitzpatrick Stadium, a 6,300-seat facility in Portland. The club launched its crest — also co-designed by Cherrie — in April 2024, which incorporates elements from the Maine seal and other state symbols. The heart in the crest is inspired by the Valentine’s Day Bandit, whose tradition of decorating storefronts and other structures in Portland with red hearts every February 14 has carried on beyond the original Bandit’s passing in 2023. Though he grew up in Pennsylvania and went to college in New York City, Cherrie has called Maine home for the past six years. To spearhead the development of a brand for a local team and watch his designs become reality has a real thrill for him. “To walk down the street and see a crest you helped create on someone’s hat at happy hour or whatever it is, it’s special to see that,” he said. “The way Portland and much of Maine has taken to the brand has been amazing.” He adds, though, that since the crest unveiling, Hearts of Pine has shipped merchandise to 45 different U.S. states and internationally. “Once you’re a Mainer, it sticks with you.” The 2025 USL League One regular season will kick off in March. Hearts of Pine plans to reveal a second kit in February and a third kit a month or two into the season, depending on potential kit clashes with opponents. Cherrie was coy about the details of the second and third kits, but did say the team was “cooking up something pretty unique” for those. “As excited as I am about this one, I think the second and third kits are going to strike a different chord with both fans of the club and people who collect jerseys,” he said. The Woods and Water Kit is available in unisex short-sleeve, unisex long-sleeve, women’s and kids’ sizes through Hearts of Pine’s online store and at the club’s holiday pop-up shop in Portland."

This potentially would bring women’s professional basketball back to Cleveland for the first time in over twenty years. The team would be the WNBA’s 16th franchise, joining the league’s growing roster as early as 2027 or 2028. The new franchise would play its home games at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse, which has undergone significant renovations in recent years. Additionally, the team would utilize the Cleveland Clinic Peak Performance Center, a new state-of-the-art training and business facility currently under development and set to open in 2027. “It has long been woven into our mission to utilize our platform to unite our community in ways that drive equal opportunities across the board,” said Rock Entertainment Group in a statement to Reuters. “To that end, we are actively pursuing bringing a WNBA expansion team to Cleveland.” Cleveland previously had a WNBA team, the Cleveland Rockers, one of the league’s original franchises. The Rockers played from 1997 to 2003, folding after then-owner Gordon Gund ceased operations and the league could not find a new owner. The city recently hosted the 2024 NCAA Women’s Final Four, which broke television viewership records for women’s sports. The WNBA, currently a 12-team league, is in the midst of a rapid expansion. The Golden State Valkyries will join the league next season, with teams in Toronto and Portland beginning play in 2026. Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has set a goal to expand to 16 teams by 2028."

They have flown nine different types aircraft dating back to World War II, with the pilots of Vought F4U Corsairs racking up over 150 kills by the end of the war. Other aircraft flown by the Jolly Rogers include the Grumman F6F Hellcat, F9F Cougar, FJ-3 Fury, McDonnell F3H Demon, Vought F-8 Crusader, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, F-14 A/B Tomcat and the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets.

As is the case with all Winter Classic games, both teams will","With less than six weeks until the big game, the Chicago Blackhawks and St. Louis Blues have today officially unveiled the uniforms they’ll be wearing at Wrigley Field for this year’s NHL Winter Classic on New Year’s Eve. As is the case with all Winter Classic games, both teams will be wearing uniforms inspired by the history of hockey in their communities. The Blackhawks, again, will reach back into the wealth of options their ninety-eight-year-old wardrobe offers. St Louis, on the other hand, has had fewer unique uniform designs over the years (and has already used up the big ones several times) and, therefore, has gone away from the franchise history a bit for their design. SHOP: 2025 NHL Winter Classic Blues and Blackhawks jerseys available now Starting with Chicago, a uniform which had leaked a couple of months ago is now confirmed as legit. We get the first time the Blackhawks have worn red for an outdoor game. Inspired by their uniforms and crests worn during the 1940s and ’50s, the Blackhawks will have several horizontal stripes across the chest in white and black with a mishmash of team logos as the main crest. The current Blackhawks’ primary logo is the centrepiece inside a roundel with four stars around the bottom, a nod to the Chicago city flag. The typeface within the roundel is a block, serif-style font, which is very close to what the crest featured on their uniforms of the late ’40s/early ’50s. You’ll note that the team name was presented as two words in those original photos; the team made their name a single word in 1986. On the back of the jersey, the player numbers incorporate a pinstripe pattern, a nod to the Chicago Cubs (perfect for a game at Wrigley Field). From the NHL: The Blackhawks’ NHL Winter Classic uniform pays homage to the franchise’s rich heritagewhile introducing distinctive new design elements. The jersey features a classic lace-neckcollar, reminiscent of hockey’s early days, complemented by a vintage cream color thatcaptures the nostalgic spirit of the Original Six era. In unique design flourishes, the frontcrest includes stars from the Chicago flag and the back numbers incorporate subtlepinstripes, a thoughtful tribute to Chicago’s deep baseball tradition. The elements cometogether to create a uniform that honours both the team’s storied past and the city’s broadersporting legacy. The St Louis Blues design looks like they’re going back to the 1930s St. Louis Flyers, a team that predates the Blues’ time in the NHL by three decades. The striping across the chest, with the team name across it, seems to be directly inspired by those Flyers uniforms. The colours blue and gold are not what the Flyers wore, but they, of course, are present here to tie this uniform to the Blues franchise. The font for the ST LOUIS name across the chest is a modified version of that prototype Blues jersey, which served as the inspiration for their Reverse Retro 2.0 uniform back in 2022-23. Something that caught my eye is a modified Bluenote logo on the shoulder, perhaps testing the waters for a future change. From the NHL: The Blues’ NHL Winter Classic uniform pays homage to the city’s hockey heritage. Thejersey’s primary wordmark represents the first time in team history that a Blue Note is notthe principal design element appearing on the chest. The font styling and numbers areinspired by an unworn prototype Blues uniform from 1966, and the jersey also includes anewly designed vintage-style “Blue Note” on the shoulder.

The “fauxback” brand unveiled today, created by Ryan Foose of Fooser Sports Design, features their familiar pig-based brand transmogrified into one from a different era. A retro-style pig character—much friendlier than the IronPigs metallic contemporary logo—features prominently on a red cap. A cream-colored jersey is adorned by red piping and a script wordmark across the chest—note the curly-Q on the descender of the G in Pigs, meant to evoke a pig’s tail. “What started as a focus on reimagining the full body pig characters ended up taking a nice ‘what-if’ turn,” Ryan Foose said. “2024 actually marks 140 years of baseball in Allentown. While this identity doesn’t necessarily pull all the way back to the 1880s, it was great collaborating with Lehigh Valley staff on what the IronPigs Baseball Club would look like from the golden era of baseball.” The IronPigs, who are named for the pig iron forged in the steel mills of eastern Pennsylvania, will play their first Friday home game on opening day, March 28, 2025."

The tweet was both posted and deleted on Tuesday, November 19, ahead of the Fighting Irish’s games in the Friendship Four tournament at the SSE Arena in Belfast coming up on November 29 and 30. According to screenshots taken before it was deleted, the post advised fans not to wear green or anything with shamrocks, the Ireland flag, leprechauns, or the words “Irish” or “Fighting Irish” in Northern Ireland capital as they may be “deemed offensive.” Weirdly, though, Notre Dame’s own special jerseys for the tournament — which were unveiled on November 6 — are emblazoned with a script “Irish” logo on the front, with a shamrock dotting the second I. The tweet advised Notre Dame fans to instead wear the school colors of navy and gold and items with the school’s “ND” monogram. The program was lambasted in the replies to the original tweet, with some users calling it “embarrassing.” “My kids have travelled all over Ireland in all the gear you say not to wear and received nothing but love,” the Belfast Telegraph reports one replier as saying. “As a Notre Dame graduate married to an Irish woman this is embarrassing and you should take down the post immediately.” Another user quoted by the Telegraph said: “This tweet is more offensive than any American university t-shirt abroad ever would be. If the fans of the Fighting Irish should be made to feel embarrassed of their programme, then don’t schedule the trip.” Notre Dame Hockey took down the post, then posted an apology a little while later: A statement on our upcoming trip to Belfast. pic.twitter.com/UVB8qRlOas This year’s edition of the Friendship Four tournament also includes teams from Boston University, Merrimack College and Harvard University.

Previous editions of the tournament were held from 2015 to 2019 and in 2022. Notre Dame’s special jerseys for the tournament are navy blue with the gold “Irish” script on the front. A logo on the shoulders combines a Celtic knot with hockey sticks and faceoff circles. The numbers on the sleeves and back also incorporate the Notre Dame Celtic knot and, along with the nameplate font, are inspired by illustrations in the Book of Kells."

According to Utah president of hockey operations Chris Armstrong in a recent article on NHL.com, Utah will stay close to their current jersey design. “What I would say is that, based on the very encouraging feedback that we’ve received from fans and our players alike on the inaugural season jersey design, we’ll be making some adjustments and some what we think are improvements, but we don’t want to deviate too far from what’s already been well received in our inaugural season,” he said. So what exactly does this mean? Well, we can really only speculate of course, but I’d take it to mean that the colours and striping will either be carried over exactly as they are or just slightly adjusted. Armstrong’s note about “making some adjustments … we think are improvements,” could point to fixing the discrepancies between the home and road jersey striping so they actually match each other. The graphic above gives us a peek at what consistent striping across the home and road sets would look like on a blank jersey, just pop in your favourite Utah Whateverzz logo concept on the chest and you’re good to go.

Fans wanting the 2024-25 Inaugural Season patch must get their jersey at the arena in Salt Lake City. When the franchise was granted earlier this year, the club announced they’d use a temporary identity for their first season in the NHL due to the quick turnaround time between acquiring the franchise and their first game. Several months later, however, the team still hasn’t announced a name, nor have they even revealed if they’ll even change their name at all.

The club launched the crest on Tuesday, November 19, making them the third AFL club to unveil a new crest in recent weeks, following Adelaide Crows and Gold Coast Suns. It follows much the same design as the club has used for more than 90 years, but with elements streamlined and modernized “for 2025 and beyond.” “An enduring symbol of the Saints for over 90 years, the Crest has long been a treasured and integral part of the club’s identity, having featured on every St Kilda guernsey in various shapes, sizes and iterations since 1933,” the club’s website says. The centerpiece of the crest is a shield, which is the same shape as the shield in the previous version of the crest, which the club adopted in 1995. A red banner at the top reads “ST. KILDA”, a change from “St. K.F.C.” in the previous version. Below the banner, a black cross sits on a white background. A ribbon across the bottom features the club’s establishment year of 1873; the shadow behind the ribbon is red on the left side and black on the right side, mirroring the ends of the ribbon on the previous version. Due to the unified nature of the new logo, the Crest is now able to be enlarged in key areas, such as on the front of the guernsey, and also minimised to better suit a raft of digital placements in the modern age; a key consideration during initial ideation. “We’re incredibly proud to reveal our new Crest as we look to set ourselves up for a strong and prosperous future,” St Kilda CEO Carl Dilena said on the club’s website. “To be successful, we’ve got to be prepared to innovate and push boundaries. This bolder, more powerful logo symbolises that, while also paying important homage to our history.” The club’s Latin motto, “FORTIUS QUO FIDELIUS” (“Strength Through Loyalty”), which formerly appeared in the ribbon under the shield, will now appear on the hemlines of St. Kilda guernseys going forward. Speaking of guernseys, those unveiled alongside the new crest followed St. Kilda’s traditional look, with red and black stripes on either side of a white block in the center, mirroring the colors in the crest ribbon. The crest itself appears in a black box on the left chest, under a sponsor logo, with the AFL logo on the opposite side. While St. Kilda was founded in 1873, they only adopted their crest in 1933. St Kilda’s Crest originated in 1933 and was immortalised into club legend later that same season in the aftermath of the famed ‘Crest Game’; a match wherein an undermanned and injury-ravaged Saints outfit — with just 15 players on the field —  toppled a ruthless and full-strength North Melbourne in one of the club’s most stirring triumphs.  In commemoration of the achievement, then-President Fred Arlington-Burke commissioned medals adorned with the Crest to be struck for every player who took part in that game. The Crest has since embodied a legacy of resilience and perseverance no matter the odds; traits synonymous with the Saints over the past 151 years. Work on the redesign began in September 2023 and involved “extensive research, conceptualisation and consultation among a randomised selection of members and fans, current and former players, key club personnel and the Board arriving at the striking new look seen today.” “We understand the significance of modifying such an iconic symbol, so ensured we engaged in a thorough consultation process with a range of stakeholders from a cross-section of our diverse supporter base,” Dilena said. “Through these focus groups, clear themes were identified as integral for our club’s logo. Most importantly, retaining the Crest itself was a non-negotiable.  “We fully understand how important the symbol is to everyone affiliated with St Kilda and hope this change to a modernised and updated Crest continues to uphold what our club proudly stands for.”  More details about the new crest are explained in this YouTube video:"
SportsLogos.Net News,FIFA Unveils ‘Innovative’ New Trophy for Club World Cup,https://news.sportslogos.net/2024/11/19/fifa-unveils-innovative-trophy-for-2025-club-world-cup/soccer/,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 15:00:00 +0000","24-carat gold-plated trophy was designed in collaboration with luxury jeweller Tiffany &#38; Co. and transforms from a shield to ""a multifaceted and orbital structure""; contains laser-engraved icons along with inscriptions in 13 languages and in Braille","After unveiling the logo for the tournament in September, FIFA has given teams participating in next summer’s FIFA Club World Cup a look at the trophy they’ll all be fighting for. FIFA unveiled the trophy on their website and social media channels last week. Designed in collaboration with global luxury jeweller Tiffany & Co., the trophy is designed to be innovative, inclusive and groundbreaking. With its rotating discs, the trophy — which is plated in 24-carat gold — can transform from a shield into “a multifaceted and orbital structure.” Both sides of the trophy feature laser-engraved inscriptions that “portray football’s rich history,” including the names of all 211 FIFA Member Associations and all six continental confederations. The central disc “an array of icons that capture football’s traditions, including symbols of stadiums and equipment and a world map.” The trophy is here! ✨Crafted in collaboration with @TiffanyAndCo, this trophy will be awarded for the first time to the winners of the inaugural #FIFACWC taking place next year. #TakeItToTheWorld pic.twitter.com/x1Wo1T1Lf4 The trophy also features engravings in 13 languages and in Braille, “further highlighting the inclusive spirit of the global game and ensuring that the tournament’s legacy is accessible to diverse audiences around the world.” It also contains space for the names of winning clubs to be engraved on the trophy for the next 24 editions. The famous Voyager Golden Records carried on NASA’s Voyager deep-space missions in the 1970s, the periodic table, maps of pioneering journeys and astronomy each played a role in the trophy’s conceptualisation. Celebrating both the past and the future of the sport, the trophy features celestial symbols representing the approximate positions of planets at the time of FIFA’s foundation on Saturday, 21 May 1904 in Paris, France, and of the tournament’s opening match on 15 June 2025 in Miami, USA. An inspiring message to the champions is engraved on the trophy, including the following: “To those who hold this trophy, history belongs to you! You are witness to a moment in time that represents the pinnacle of club football, bestowed upon few but celebrated by many.” These words reflect the trophy’s status as a symbol of greatness, honouring the legends of the past while inspiring clubs globally. Club World Cup-winning clubs will each receive a replica of the trophy after the final. “This official FIFA Club World Cup Winner’s Trophy mirrors the perpetual trophy in its craft, construction and scale – complete with official nameplates emblazoned with club emblems, along with dates relating to their victory,” FIFA says. The trophy will be on display for the first time at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup draw, which will take place on Thursday, December 5, in Miami. The tournament itself will take place in summer 2025 in the United States, with 12 venues in 11 cities on the East Coast scheduled to host matches (CONCACAF Gold Cup matches will be held in cities on the West Coast). The final will be held on Sunday, July 13, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will bring together 32 teams from the six continental confederations around the globe. The winners of each confederation’s top club competition (e.g., UEFA Champions League) from 2021 to 2024 automatically qualify, while other clubs can qualify through a club ranking over the four-year period. The 32 teams will be split into eight groups of four, with the top two teams from each group qualifying for the knockout rounds. Since 2005, the FIFA Club World Cup had been held every December, with only the winners of the previous year’s top club competitions taking part. With the new format and schedule, it will now only take place every four years, in the year before a men’s World Cup."

Got some new Golds for this Saturday Night in Death Valley pic.twitter.com/BzaEHkkLsG The gold jerseys follow the same overall design as the Tigers’ standard home white and purple alternate jerseys, with UCLA stripes on the shoulders, contrasting sleeve cuffs and the SEC logo on the base of the collar. The only notable difference with the gold jerseys is the purple numbers on the front, back and sleeves, as they include a white stroke, whereas the digits on the home white and purple alternate jerseys are a single color. This will mark just the fifth time in school history that LSU will wear gold jerseys, joining a 35-0 over the Commodores in 1996, a 27-9 win over Notre Dame in the 1997 Independence Bowl, a 22-10 loss at Florida in 1998 and a 23-20 win over Mississippi State in 2016. The Tigers did not reveal which color helmets and pants they’ll wear with the gold jerseys, though it’s worth noting they were paired with gold helmets and white pants in 1996 and 1998, as well as white helmets with white pants in 1997 and 2016. LSU has mostly worn white jerseys at home since 1958, when head coach Paul Dietzel – who had a habit of tinkering with the team’s uniforms – chose to wear white during all five home games that season.  The Tigers went on to capture their first national championship with a 7-0 win over Clemson in the Sugar Bowl, and Dietzel – who was known as a superstitious man – didn’t change their uniforms after that. That tradition continued well after Dietzel left for another job, though the NCAA eventually changed its rules and required teams to wear dark-colored jerseys at home, forcing LSU to wear purple jerseys at home from 1983-94. In 1995, then-head coach Gerry DiNardo successfully petitioned the NCAA to change the rules, though one stipulation was that the visiting team would have to give the home team permission to wear white jerseys. The first team to deny the Tigers’ request was Vanderbilt in 1996, and instead of wearing their purple jerseys, they took the field in new gold jerseys. The Commodores’ decision likely stemmed from DiNardo – who was their coach from 1991-94 – taking the job in Baton Rouge.  Header photo courtesy of @LSUfootball on X/Twitter."

It was the largest battle fought by the United States in the war and the third-deadliest campaign in the country’s storied history, but the paratroopers’ refusal to surrender played a significant role in stopping the Nazi’s “last great offensive” in the war. The all-black uniforms reflect the snow-covered forests where the battle was won, with a snowflake-like pattern on the helmets, shoulders and sleeves, as well as a gradient design on bottom of the white numbers. The Invasion Star, which was used on American aircraft and vehicles to aid in battlefield identification, can be seen on the right shoulder above a “Bastogne” patch, with lettering that reflects the road sign held by General Anthony McAuliffe in a photo after the siege was broken. The left sleeve features the 101st Airborne Division’s patch, while the right sleeve includes the 1944 American flag in its original orientation and proportions, mimicking the flag worn on the paratroopers’ jumpsuits. The jerseys are complete with an “Army!” wordmark on the back nameplate that evokes the typewritten version of McAuliffe’s famous reply to Nazi demands to surrender: “NUTS!” Lastly, the helmets will display card suits, which were used by the 101st Airborne Division’s paratroopers and glider troops to identify their unit affiliations for the jump into Normandy and throughout the European Theatre. The suits will be randomly assigned to each player, with clubs representing the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment, hearts signifying the 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment, diamonds symbolizing the 501st and spades honoring the 506th. Sources have indicated the the Midshipmen, who also wear alternate uniforms against the Black Knights each season, will unveil their design on Wednesday.

Tottenham says in Monday’s announcement that the new brand identity aims to embrace its “rich history and unmistakable heritage” and was created with the input of more than 300 players, staff and supporters. “Our new identity enables a more playful, daring approach for the Club’s brand across the multitude of platforms on which it now features, with a particular focus on clarity in digital environments,” the club said. The most prominent change is the team’s primary crest, the most recent version of which depicts a cockerel standing on top of a football and was adopted in 2006. With Monday’s announcement the curved “TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR” text has been removed from underneath the football, allowing the crest to stand on its own and to be more effectively scaled across different applications, including digital. Along with the reworked logo, the club has also introduced a silhouette version “that allows for a more playful expression of the brand.” While navy blue and white remain as Spurs’ core colors, the new brand also introduces “a new palette of supporting colours,” inspired by elements of the Club’s history. These include Blazing Yellow, Paxton Purple, Hot Terracotta and Elm Green. Another major element of the remastered brand is the reintroduction of a “THFC” monogram to the club’s suite of logos. Similar monograms featured heavily in previous iterations of the club crest, and now it stands on its own. Tottenham has also developed a set of six “hallmarks” to celebrate elements of the club’s history and support their brand storytelling. These include: Tottenham’s signature font — which was first developed nearly 20 years ago — has also been reworked, with additional weights and widths added along with special characters and ligatures. A lowercase version has also been designed for use in paragraphs and long-form body copy. Spurs have been using a version of the cockerel crest without the text underneath on their match kits for several years now. This includes kits made by both Nike and Under Armour."

The 36-time Dutch first-division champions based in Amsterdam announced on Sunday, November 17, that they would be officially reverting to their classic crest full-time in time for the start of the 2025-26 season. This means the new old crest will be used on match shirts and “gradually implemented across all of the club’s expressions.” The classic crest was used from 1928 to 1991, at which time the club switched to a more abstract version — drawn with just 11 lines to represent the 11 players on a soccer team — that they have used ever since. Both versions depict a bust of the Greek war hero Ajax, who was an important figure in the Trojan War. Ajax celebrated the return of the classic logo on Sunday during an exhibition match between legends of their club and legends from Spanish club Real Madrid at the Johan Cruijff ArenA in Amsterdam. Ajax will celebrate the 125th anniversary of its founding on March 18, 2025. “We know that the majority of our fans have cherished this wish for years, and we felt that our 125th anniversary was the perfect moment to give back the classic logo to our fans and ourselves,” said Ajax CEO Menno Geelen on the club’s website. “Furthermore, history has shown that we are at our best when we remain true to the Ajax DNA. That’s why we are doing everything within the club to uphold that DNA, from our football philosophy to our core values. Bringing back the classic logo symbolizes this commitment and serves as both a tribute to our rich history and an inspiration for the future—a future that relies on everything we hold dear about our club.” “The 125th anniversary feels like a very fitting moment to give the logo back to the club, the fans, and ourselves,” added Ernst Boekhorst, chair of the club’s board of directors. “We are delighted to make such a contribution.” Ajax used the classic crest on its home kits as recently as 2021-22, when it helped with the 1970s throwback aesthetic they were trying to achieve."

Throughout the season, the Nationals will use a commemorative 20th anniversary logo, first teased on the scoreboard at Nationals Park during their final home games of the 2024 season back in September. Nothing’s been announced officially, but the team will likely wear the logo on their uniform as either a cap or jersey sleeve patch. The logo shows a blue roundel trimmed in red (just like the Washington Nationals logo) with the team name around the top half in white, and the years 2005 * 2025 ’round the bottom. Inside this circle, on white, we see the Washington D.C. skyline in navy blue, with the Washington Monument and U.S. Capitol Dome visible, as well as the team’s home stadium – Nationals Park, in the foreground. Hovering over the skyline is a large number 20 in red with blue trim, matching the same style used for player numbers on the Nationals uniforms. Major League Baseball returned to the U.S. capital following a 34-year abscence when the Montreal Expos, who had played in Montreal since 1969, moved south following the conclusion of the 2004 season. Washington has previously celebrated anniversaries on their uniforms with commemorative logos for their first season in 2005 and their tenth in 2015. The Montreal Expos wore an anniversary sleeve patch just once, to mark their 25th season in 1993. Just one other change has been confirmed for the Washington Nationals in 2025, the elimination of their grey-and-pink Cherry Blossom-themed City Connect uniform. It is expected that the club will introduce a new City Connect to replace it."

According to the league, these circles represent the three stages of competition in the second-year tournament, including group play, the quarterfinals and the semifinals/championship game, which are linked because they take place at the same location. The trophy is also – like the team-specific designs – prominently displayed at midcourt and in the lanes, though the team wordmarks and/or logos in the former are replaced by the Emirates NBA Cup wordmark.  The wood-colored court is complete with a sublimated bracket, which matches the special basketballs being used during the tournament, as well as a black out-of-bounds area with a red-to-blue gradient design along the bottom baseline to represent the Eastern and Western Conferences. A new 🏀 design for #EmiratesNBACup Games!Group play begins TONIGHT on TNT & NBA League Pass 📺 pic.twitter.com/je2NeYzbWe There are also sublimated stars from the “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign within the out-of-bounds area, as well as the NBA Cup wordmark and advertisements for Michelob ULTRA Courtside on the baselines and Emirates logos along the upper sideline. The color of the court is notable, as the court used during last year’s In-Season Tournament – which was renamed this offseason – featured a predominately blue background with a large red stripe down the middle and created contrast issues against the semifinalists’ City Edition uniforms. That forced the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers, runner-up Indiana Pacers and semifinals Milwaukee Bucks and New Orleans Pelicans to wear their Association, Icon or Statement Edition uniforms in the final two rounds. The 2024 Emirates NBA Cup continues with six group play games on Nov. 19, headlined by the undefeated Cleveland Cavaliers taking on the Boston Celtics at 7 p.m. on TNT, immediately followed by the Oklahoma City Thunder at the San Antonio Spurs.

It&#8217;s the first tweak the club has made to their set since they rebranded as the Guardians three years ago. We&#8217;ll start with the home and road set,"The Cleveland Guardians announced today they’re making changes to all four of their standard uniforms for the 2025 Major League Baseball season. It’s the first tweak the club has made to their set since they rebranded as the Guardians three years ago. We’ll start with the home and road set before moving onto the bigger changes announced today, to their two alternate jerseys. At home the Guardians will continue to wear the same scripted red wordmark across their chest as they have since 2022, but it’s now presented straight across the jersey rather than diagonally. New red/blue/red piping has been added to this jersey as well, around the collar and around each sleeve, replacing last year’s single blue stripe. The biggest change to the Guardians home uniform is the new cap they’ll wear with it, which will now be predominantly red instead of blue. The logo on the front of the cap remains their “Diamond-C” logo, but now in blue with white trim. For road games, the only change we’ll see to the Guardians grey jersey is the addition of that same piping we see on the home whites — red/blue/red around the collar and each arm. The “CLEVELAND” wordmark across the chest remains the same. The cap paired with the road grey jersey is now the blue crown with red visor the team wore for home games from 2022-24. The all-blue cap, which had been worn exclusively on the road last year, is history. The Guardians red home jersey will see a totally new wordmark across the chest, as they’ll now use their “Bridge Print” font to display GUARDIANS in blue with white trim. Previously, this jersey used the same scripted-style lettering we see on the home whites. The new piping is present on the red jerseys as well, but now in a blue/white/blue pattern. Photos show the Guardians wearing their blue cap with a red visor alongside this jersey, just as they did last year. The biggest overall change comes to the road blue set, where the arched “CLEVELAND” wordmark has been scrapped in favour of their Diamond C cap logo in red with white trim. The club says this is an homage to the team’s uniforms worn between 1901 and 1945 which also featured a large “C” on the front. Piping is present on this set as well, in a red/white/red pattern around the collar and sleeves. No changes here! In 2025, the Guardians will continue to wear their Guardians of Traffic-inspired navy blue City Connect uniform exactly as it was in 2024. My thoughts? While I like its design, the red cap paired their home white jersey will take some getting used to; they did try this once before, very briefly in 2018, before going back to their usual navy blue lids. I wouldn’t be surprised to see them switch to the blue caps at home at some point in 2025 and instead wear the red caps with the red jerseys. The addition of the piping is nice, but where it looks especially sharp is on the club’s new blue road alternate tops. That classic bright red/white/red immediately gives me flashbacks to uniform styles of the 1970s and 1980s (think of the Big Red Machine). The big bold red “C” on the dark navy blue jersey is also a strong look with nice ties back to the team’s uniform roots. None of the new jerseys are available to purchase yet, the team says they’ll be available at some point before the start of the 2025 season."

They're still celebrating a World Series championship, so one could forgive the Dodgers if they decided to take a half-day. But instead, they made sure to knock one item off their 2025 to-do list, locking in one of their expected starting pitchers on a new salary. Tony Gonsolin, a former National League All-Star who missed the entire 2024 season while rehabbing from Tommy John surgery, could be an under-the-radar addition to the Dodgers' star-studded rotation, which will be headlined by Tyler Glasnow, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and Shohei Ohtani. On Friday, according to Mark Feinsand of MLB.com, the Dodgers and Gonsolin agreed upon a $5.4 million salary for 2025, avoiding arbitration. Gonsolin had played out the previous two seasons on a two-year, $6.5 million extension, and is once again arb-eligible for 2026. In 2022, his last semi-full season at the big-league level, Gonsolin was sensational. He made his first All-Star team, went 16-1 to lead the majors in winning percentage (.941), and finished the year with a 2.14 ERA in 24 starts. Gonsolin briefly returned to pitch in Triple-A in September, but he'll be making his first big-league appearance since August 2023 when he takes the hill this spring. The Dodgers have plenty of other rotation options, but there should be a spot for the 30-year-old as long as he looks like his old self. Having Gonsolin locked into a deal before the holidays should help the veteran focus on what matters most--his performance on the mound. If he can contribute to the rotation in a meaningful way, the Dodgers might be truly unstoppable next season.

Landers proposed the bombshell transfer portal possibility while operating under the hypothetical that Quinn Ewers returns to Texas. “Brian Kelly is a man in need of a lifeline right now, with his LSU team reeling after three straight losses and top 2025 QB Bryce Underwood flipping his commitment to Michigan on Thursday night,” Landers prefaced before saying, “And what a lifeline Manning would be, a guy who was just as sought-after as Underwood coming out of high school — and who just so happened to grow up nearby in New Orleans? “The Tigers weren't on Manning's initial list of finalists, which could be a sign that Manning is looking to get a little bit further away from home. But they have the recent track record in QB development, having put Jayden Daniels (and soon Garrett Nussmeier) into the NFL and churning out great receivers on a regular basis. There isn't much behind Nussmeier for 2025, and if Manning becomes available, LSU could take all that Underwood money and simply redirect it to the next best thing.” Horns247’s Chip Brown reported on November 21 that Ewers is expected to declare for the 2025 NFL draft. “I spoke to two sources close to Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers on Wednesday night who said they expect Ewers to enter the 2025 NFL Draft after this season, meaning Saturday's game against Kentucky (2:30 p.m., ABC) would be Ewers' last regular-season home game as a Longhorn,” Brown wrote. Manning would represent a dramatic upswing for a Kelly-led program with practically no narrative wins to stand in recent months besides early-season wins over Ole Miss and South Carolina. In truth, LSU is supposed to win those matchups every year given the program’s pedigree.  With all that said, Manning could do worse than a school that turned two recent transfers, Joe Burrow and Jayden Daniels, into Heisman winners.

With the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets both trying to land Juan Soto, the Braves may need to add a superstar of their own to help compete. While listing ""emergency"" signings the Braves can make if Soto lands in the National League East, FanSided's Christopher Kline urged the Braves to sign Houston Astros star Alex Bregman. ""The best front offices in the MLB are creative. On the surface, Alex Bregman isn't a fit for Atlanta,"" wrote Kline. ""He's a battle-tested third baseman and the Braves already have an All-Star at the hot corner in Austin Riley. Bregman has said he's open to playing second base, but that's Ozzie Albies' position. The Braves' star-studded infield, on the surface, negates the need for Bregman."" Even if Bregman moves to second base, the Braves would need to move Ozzie Albies. Albies made 195 starts at shortstop as a minor league player before his debut. He only made 93 starts at second base before his debut. Playing shortstop in the big leagues is not easy, but signing Bregman and moving Albies to shortstop could do a lot for the Braves offense. Albies is an upgrade offensively over Orlando Arcia at shortstop. Bregman is a two-time All-Star and slashed .260/.315/.453 with 26 home runs last season. Spotrac projects him to sign a four-year, $119 million deal in free agency. Signing Bregman would upgrade the Braves offense while also adding another superstar to keep pace with the Mets or Phillies if Juan Soto signs.

Their offensive line was stretched so thin last week that tackle Jake Curhan, who had bounced around on the practice squad this season, was called upon to play 65 offensive snaps at left guard against the Green Bay Packers. Curhan held up surprisingly well, however, and the Bears will get starter Tevin Jenkins (ankle) back in the lineup this week against the Vikings after he was removed from Friday’s injury report. The Bears will need all the help they can get to protect rookie QB Caleb Williams against Minnesota, which enters Week 12 among the NFL leaders in sacks (35) and total takeaways (21). The Vikings head to Soldier Field relatively healthy, despite what has been a tough stretch of three consecutive road games.  Who’s in and who’s out for this key Week 12 divisional matchup? Here’s a full team-by-team injury breakdown, with the latest updates off of Friday’s practice reports: Bates was knocked out of Chicago’s loss to the Green Bay last week, and was unable to clear the NFL’s five-step concussion protocol. Curhan was pressed into action, but Chicago has the luxury of going back to Jenkins, their former second-round pick. Hicks was unable to log a single practice after an ankle injury limited him to 39 snaps against the Packers last week. He had been the Bears’ starting free safety since Week 6. Chicago will turn to sixth-year pro Jonathan Owens for an expanded role against Minnesota.  The rookie third-round pick out of Yale will miss his fourth straight game after injuring his calf in Week 8 against the Washington Commanders. The rookie has played 54 total offensive snaps this season in a reserve role. Swift was able to log a full practice on Friday, which likely puts him on the right side of questionable to face the Vikings. The Bears used closer to a 50/50 split at running back last week against the Packers, with Roschon Johnson matching his season high with 10 carries on 30 offensive snaps. Oliver will be inactive for the first time this season after being held back in practice this week. T.J. Hockenson is back leading the Vikings tight end depth chart. Oliver’s absence could mean a slight uptick in playing time for veteran Johnny Mundt, who has 15 receptions on 22 targets through 10 games this season. Murphy drew the questionable tag after being ruled out early last week. The exciting undrafted rookie out of UCLA has now practiced in full on five straight days. He had his 21-day practice window opened on Nov. 6, so his NFL debut could be coming Sunday. The Vikings would have to make a roster move, though, to activate him off injured reserve.  Muse hasn’t played since Week 2, but he had his 21-day practice window opened this week. He was able to log three full practices. The Vikings have taken a cautious approach with guys coming off extended injuries this season, but Muse’s services could be needed this week with Oliver already ruled out.

For the first time, the NFL has flexed one of its games into Thursday Night Football.  The Broncos' Week 16 game against the Los Angeles Chargers – originally scheduled for Sunday, December 22 – will now take place on Thursday, December 19. The game will replace what was originally scheduled between the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals, which will now be shifted to that Sunday. It will be the Broncos' second Thursday night game this season, having defeated the New Orleans Saints 33-10 back in Week 7.  But that is where this move gets interesting.  Because it will be the second time the Broncos have had to place a Thursday night game on the road this season, the team had to sign off on the league's idea to reschedule it.  Broncos had to sign off on the Week 16 TNF flex, b/c it's their 2nd TNF road game. They were alerted Tuesday. Interesting element—Denver plays Cincinnati in Week 17 (X-mas week). Bengals got flexed out of TNF. So Denver gains the edge that the Bengals previously had for Week 17. This means that the Broncos chose to approve that decision, which is strange. It's a divisional road game against a team that they will be contending with for playoff positioning. This move gives the Broncos two fewer days to prepare for the Chargers, who they already lost to once this season.  The Broncos will get some extra rest before having to play the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 17. But in a critical spot on the schedule against a strong team, there doesn't seem to be one good reason why the Broncos didn't tell the league no when approached with this proposition.  It remains to be seen how this game will turn out, but if the Broncos come out sloppy in this one – as many road teams on Thursday nights do – it will be easy to second agreeing to have this game flexed.  Broncos had much better deal on the table for Jerry Jeudy, according to report Broncos safety won't play in any games this season Broncos encouraged to sign Saints tight end in 2025 wave of free agency Bo Nix has surprisingly never met the best player in Denver Broncos history Broncos receive highest grade of Week 11 following win over Falcons Travis Wakeman has been covering the NFL since 2012 when he started with Bleacher Report.

While listing ""emergency"" signings the Braves can make if Soto lands in the National League East, FanSided's Christopher Kline urged the Braves to make a blockbuster trade for Chicago White Sox ace Garrett Crochet. ""Sometimes it's best to zag when other teams zig. If the Mets or Phillies load up on offense with Soto, perhaps the Braves should take the opposite approach and add Garrett Crochet to arguably the best pitching staff in the National League,"" wrote Kline. ""We've seen Atlanta connected to Crochet and it's a clear fit, made all the more appealing with Fried's potential departure looming over the franchise."" 2024 was Crochet's first season as a starter. All he did was earn an All-Star nod and pitch to a 3.58 ERA. Bringing him to Atlanta could potentially replace Max Fried. He would not have the pressure of a No. 1 starter pitching behind National League Cy Young Award winner Chris Sale. Spotrac projects Crochet to sign a six-year, $136 million deal when he hits free agency after the 2026 season. USA Today's Bob Nightengale revealed that the White Sox plan to move Crochet this winter. ""No already-employed player was sought after more at these GM meetings than Chicago White Sox starter Garrett Crochet, who struck out 209 batters in 146 innings and earned only $800,000 last season,"" wrote Nightengale.

Brian Callahan's squad has lost five of its last six games and will likely obtain a top-three selection in the 2025 NFL Draft.  The Titans suffered their eighth loss of the campaign to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 11 and will travel to NRG Stadium to square off against the Houston Texans in Week 12. Though many factors have contributed to an underwhelming season in Nashville, quarterback play has been Tennessee's Achilles heel this season. Will Levis has struggled with turnovers and erratic plays, while backup quarterback Mason Rudolph didn't do anything special during his time as the starter when Levis dealt with a shoulder injury. The Titans could select a quarterback in the first round of the draft this offseason, but there is no clear solution to the team's biggest issue currently on the roster. That said, ESPN's Ben Solak believes Tennessee should make a move for former New York Giants' signal caller Daniel Jones. The Titans are in a similar spot to the Panthers. There's a little more hope for Will Levis, but Tennessee should and will be investigating all quarterback options this offseason. If the Titans want to bring Jones in as a potential veteran bridge, they can sign him now and potentially give him a start or two down the stretch once they're mathematically eliminated from playoff contention. The Titans have been using Levis more in the designed running game as of late, and Jones would benefit from that usage -- but that seems more like an invention of necessity than what coach Brian Callahan sees as ideal for his offense. Jones might not be the best schematic fit in Tennessee right away, but he's pretty much a better version of Levis across the board right now, so he'd bring improvement to the offense immediately. The Giants released Jones on Friday after six up and down years. The former Duke standout was benched on Monday and dropped all the way down to QB4 on New York's depth chart before his release, per Charlotte Carroll of The Athletic.  Jones has been uninspiring in ten starts this season, tossing eight touchdowns to seven interceptions with a 79.4 passer rating. The 2019 No.6 overall pick still has some talent, but his accuracy and ball security have regressed in 2024.   Though Levis likely isn't the answer for the Titans at the sport's most vital position, acquiring Jones would be a terrible move from general manager Ran Carthon. Levis and Jones have many of the same flaws, and Tennessee already has a solid backup in Rudolph.  The only logical reason for signing Jones is that the Titans would acquire a compensatory draft pick in April's draft if the former first-round pick signs with another team this offseason. But overall, Tennessee should stay far away from Daniel Jones.

While listing ""emergency"" signings the Braves can make if Soto lands in the National League East, FanSided's Christopher Kline urged the Braves to sign star shortstop Willy Adames. ""He adds 30-plus homers and 100-plus RBIs to an offense that lapped the rest of the league a couple years ago. That is a tantalizing proposition,"" wrote Kline. ""He's excellent in the field and dangerous on the bases, too (21 steals). There's not much to dislike about Adames, and the Braves need to operate with a mix of aggression and desperation if Soto ends up in the division."" Adames had a career year in Milwaukee and has shown he can consistently stay on the field. He started in 161 games last season. He set career highs in home runs, steals and RBIs. Adding him to an offense with Matt Olson, Austin Riley, Ronald Acuña Jr. and Marcell Ozuna could be enough to surpass either NL East team in the running for Soto. Orlando Arcia had a regression after his 2023 All-Star season. His batting average dropped to .218 last season.

Lattimore, who was acquired just before the Nov. 5 trade deadline, has yet to suit up for his new squad. The Commanders knew Lattimore was dealing with a hamstring injury when they traded for him, and made the move in hopes that it could pay off down the stretch even if he wouldn't be available immediately. Should Washington be concerned about Lattimore's health? Not necessarily... yet. The Commanders' games both this Sunday and next Sunday are against reeling teams in the Cowboys and Tennessee Titans, both of whom they should be able to beat without him. After that, they have a bye week prior to their four-game to end the regular season. Those four games will be against the suddenly surging New Orleans Saints, then against the Eagles and Atlanta Falcons at home before finishing up in Dallas. That's the stretch in which Lattimore's presence will become crucial. Even though Washington made the move him anticipating a playoff run, he'll need some preparation first. The Commanders can't expect to insert him into the lineup for a playoff game completely raw. If Lattimore isn't back after the bye week, then there will be cause for concern. For now, though, let him heal up until he's 100 percent. Ryan McCafferty is a die-hard sports fan from Fairfax, Virginia.

After being foiled once again by the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Central--despite stealing the Brewers' old manager, Craig Counsell--the Cubs are down in the dumps. But perhaps a blockbuster trade with the crosstown Chicago White Sox could be the pick-me-up the franchise needs. The Cubs and White Sox have partnered up on some big trades in the past, most notably the Jose Quintana deal in 2017 and the Craig Kimbrel swap in 2021. But sending a certain All-Star lefty pitcher across town just might take the cake. White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet is the biggest name on the trade market this winter, coming off an All-Star season where he struck out a ridiculous 12.9 batters per nine innings. Every contending team could use Crochet, but the Cubs might be the single team that could benefit the most from landing him. Recently, Elijah Evans of Just Baseball proposed a trade that would send Crochet to the North Side in exchange for outfielder Owen Caissie, shortstop Jefferson Rojas, and right-handed pitcher Jaxon Wiggins. ""Garrett Crochet is another level of a pitcher and the Cubs are seeking a few big pieces to push them into the legit playoff tier in the National League,"" Evans said. ""They’re likely to start with the free agent market but could slide into the Crochet sweepstakes more seriously if they can’t land a top arm available there. In terms of prospect fit, their plethora of hitters lines up well with what the White Sox want to acquire."" Caissie is Just Baseball's No. 35 overall prospect and Rojas is No. 53, so losing both would certainly weaken the Cubs' future outlook on the position player side of things. But as great as it is to have prospects, what the Cubs need now is a big-league-ready star. Crochet would change the Cubs' entire perception for the 2025 season. Rolling a trio of dominant lefties out with Crochet, Shota Imanaga, and Justin Steele could be the thing that finally vaults them over the Brewers in the Central, and possibly all the way to title contention.

Last Saturday, Boston College (5-5, 2-4 ACC) fell 38-28 to SMU (9-1, 6-0 ACC) at Gerald J. Ford Stadium. The Eagles cut the lead to 31-28 on Kyle Robichaux’s 3-yard touchdown run, then forced a SMU punt on the ensuing drive. However, Boston College’s next possession turned sour as the team faced an unwelcoming fourth-and-19 on their own 22-yard line. Quarterback Grayson James was sacked by SMU’s Jahfari Harvey for a nine-yard loss, setting up a Mustangs touchdown just four plays later. But it wasn’t just the on-field loss that left O’Brien fuming. The first-year Eagles coach has now called out the SMU fanbase, saying the atmosphere behind Boston College’s bench last Saturday was among the worst he’s ever experienced. “I’m just going to tell you, their fans behind our bench… they were atrocious. The worst,” O’Brien said on his weekly podcast with Jon Meterparel. “I’ve been in the SEC, I’ve been in the NFL. I’ve never seen anything or heard anything like what was coming out of their fans’ mouths behind our bench. I mean, it was bad.”  Those comments carry weight considering O’Brien’s extensive coaching career through different parts of the country. The 55-year-old began his career as a tight ends coach with the Cleveland Browns, then later served as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach during the New England Patriots dynasty. He was the head coach of the Houston Texans from 2014 to 2020 and has also held college coaching roles at Georgia Tech, Maryland, Duke, and Penn State, where he led the Nittany Lions from 2012 to 2013. O’Brien’s disdain for the SMU crowd may have a logical explanation. Gerald J. Ford Stadium, with its capacity of roughly 35,000, features a student section located directly behind the visiting team’s bench. This proximity likely added to the verbal barrage aimed at O’Brien and his team. It’s worth noting that larger venues in conferences like the SEC or Big Ten often create similarly intense atmospheres, yet their student sections are nowhere near the visitors benches. At least O’Brien and Boston College can look forward to hosting SMU next season at Alumni Stadium in Chestnut Hill. As for SMU, it’s been a season worth celebrating. In their first year as members of the ACC, the Mustangs are undefeated in conference play and well on their way to the ACC Championship Game in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Dec. 7. They also recently just handed coach Rhett Lashlee a contract extension. Given their success, it’s no surprise the SMU fanbase has plenty of reasons to be fired up.

Some red flags were raised this week, however, when wide receiver DeVonta Smith was unable to practice through what has been a weeks-long hamstring issue. The Los Angeles Rams, Philly’s opponent this week on Sunday Night Football, are about as healthy as they’ve been all season. Star wideouts Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua have avoided the injury report entirely since Week 9, after both players missed time during the team’s 1-4 start to the season.  MORE: NFL picks, score predictions for Week 12: Philadelphia Eagles vs. Los Angeles Who’s in and who’s out for this key Week 12 NFC matchup? Here’s a full team-by-team injury breakdown, with the latest updates off of Friday’s practice reports: Woods, an undrafted rookie out of SMU, was unable to practice this week and hasn’t played since injuring his ankle during pregame warmups in Week 10 against the Miami Dolphins. He had earned himself a special teams role prior to the injury. He’s played just 13 total snaps on defense this season as a reserve cornerback. The Rams opened Leveston’s 21-day practice window this week, but he’ll remain on injured reserve despite logging three full practices. The seventh-round rookie’s potential NFL debut will have to wait at least another week. Havenstein appears poised to miss his third consecutive game, as he was unable to ramp up to a full practice this week and drew the doubtful tag. Warren McClendon Jr. got the start at right tackle and held up well last week in the win over the New England Patriots. He’s expected to get the nod again over Joe Noteboom. This is a major blow to Philly’s passing game, and an unexpected one coming off the mini bye week. Smith has been dealing with a hamstring issue for weeks, but it was yet to impact his playing time. He was unable to practice at all this week, though, signifying a setback with the injury. Smith’s absence should mean expanded roles for Jahan Dotson and rookies Ainias Smith and Johnny Wilson on Sunday night against the Rams. MORE: Eagles urged to unleash pair of rookie playmakers on offense The Eagles opened Covey’s 21-day practice window this week, and he was able to log three full practices. His return could be well timed with Smith already ruled out for the game. Covey was Philly’s top punt returner and caught seven passes for 34 yards over the first three games of the season. He landed on IR after taking a hard hit to the shoulder against New Orleans on Sept. 22.

The news put even more heat on Tigers head coach Brian Kelly, who is having a disastrous month of November.  For first-year head coach Sherrone Moore and the Wolverines, though, Underwood is a huge pickup for the 2025 recruiting class. Not to mention, this is one of the first big flips Moore can call fully his own—most of Michigan's 2024 class committed under former coach Jim Harbaugh. Why did Underwood ultimately flip? There are various reports about Michigan's NIL collective, called Champions Circle, which is said to be at the heart of the flip. Let's take a look at the big names involved in the Champions Circle, who was involved in Underwood's flip, and what it could mean for Michigan's recruiting future. NCAAF HQ: Live NCAAF scores | Updated NCAAF standings | Full NCAAF schedule Underwood's flip isn't exactly coming cheap. According to CBS Sports' Dennis Dodds, the rumored deal from Michigan is around $10 million. The New York Post reported the exact figure to be $10.5 million. According to The Advocate, LSU's NIL deal offer to Underwood was around $1.5 million. As far as the people responsible for the flip, Moore deserves a lot of credit. Per CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz, Underwood took a secret visit to Ann Arbor on Monday and Tuesday, where he shadowed Moore at practice, sat in on meetings and learned more about Michigan overall.  Zenitz adds that Underwood developed a relationship with former Wolverines star and future NFL Hall of Famer Tom Brady, which also contributed to the flip.  One other organization that apparently was crucial in pulling this off: Michigan NIL collective Champions Circle. Some of the big names involved with the collective include Michigan booster Nate Forbes — managing partner of The Forbes Company — as well as boosters Jolin and Larry Ellison. The Champions Circle released a statement following Underwood's commitment naming all three people:  Welcome Bryce Underwood, the #1 Recruit in the Nation We want to thank our Founding Members and others associated with Champions Circle who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes to make it possible to continue our work building championship teams at Michigan. Founding Member and Chairman, Nate Forbes, said: “We are very excited to keep Bryce home in Michigan as he continues to build his legacy. I want to personally thank Jolin and Larry Ellison who were instrumental in making this happen by providing Champions Circle with invaluable guidance and financial resources.” We encourage all parties who have publicly expressed interest in assisting Michigan’s NIL’s efforts to join the 11,000 individuals who have contributed to Champions Circle. For any fan wishing to support our efforts to keep Michigan the Leaders and Best, please contribute through our “Those Who Stay (Home)...” fundraising campaign. Larry Ellison is a billionaire and co-founder of Oracle. He's reportedly the second-richest man in the world. Although he is originally from New York and grew up in Chicago, he apparently was instrumental in Underwood's flip. It's unclear of his connection to the school other than the recent recruitment of Underwood. (Note: At this time, the identity of Jolin is unclear.) One other name reportedly involved is Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports. Although it's unclear if he was involved financially in any way, the Michigan alumnus stated he spoke with Underwood and his family during the process. ""Everyone's like 'Dave, how much were you involved?' Listen, there are a lot of other factors. ... Was I involved in a call with the family? Are they lovely people? Did we pitch a plan? Of course, we did,"" Portnoy said.  Champions Circle is Michigan's NIL collective, which assists athletes across all sports for the Wolverines. Here's what the collective's ""Who We Are"" page reads:  Champions Circle® is a community of fans, alumni, and supporters whose goal is empowering University of Michigan student-athletes to be the leaders and best through name, image, and likeness. Champions Circle® is committed to operating within the NCAA and university guidelines, to ensure Michigan remains at the forefront of college athletics. Champions Circle® partners with Valiant Management Group (VMG) to hold our NIL events and help with fundraising and marketing activities. There are numerous board members also listed on the website, including Forbes. According to a list of top NIL collectives put together by On3Sports, Champions Circle is 13th nationally. Per On3, each collective included were estimated to spend over $200 million this year.  Ellison co-founded the Oracle Corporation, a multinational computer technology company, in 1979. According to Forbes, his net worth is right around $235.3 billion—yes, that's billion, with a b. Forbes lists Ellison second on their list of billionaires behind Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX founder. Portnoy, who founded Barstool Sports in 2004, has a reported net worth of around $150 million.  In Michigan's first season without Jim Harbaugh, it's no secret that the Wolverines have struggled at quarterback. Michigan has gone back and forth between Davis Warren and Jack Tuttle. With just two games left against Northwestern and Ohio State, the Wolverines are not yet bowl eligible with just five wins.  As Sporting News' Bill Bender notes, Underwood is Michigan's the highest-rated highest-ranked quarterback per 247Sports, and is just the fifth five-star signal-caller the Wolverines have recruited since 2005. The last two were Chad Henne in 2005 and Ryan Mallett in 2007. Regardless of how the deal was done, this is a ginormous recruiting win for Moore and Michigan, and it puts the Wolverines right back in the playoff and Big Ten title conversation for 2025.  Morgan Moriarty joined The Sporting News as a content producer in the fall of 2024.

They may have to dump an expensive contract to do so.,"Aaliyan Mohammed The Chicago Cubs are going to be aggressive this offseason after missing the postseason in 2024. They may have to dump an expensive contract to do so. FanSided's Zach Pressnell predicted that the Cubs would trade Cody Bellinger by the end of Major League Baseball's Winter Meetings because his contract could prevent them from signing star free agents. ""For Chicago, it's the contract that kills them,"" wrote Pressnell. ""Having to pay Bellinger right around $30 million for the next year or two is quite crippling to the pursuit of any big-name free agent like Corbin Burnes or Pete Alonso."" Bellinger signed a three-year, $80 million deal with the Cubs before last season. The deal included player options for 2025 and 2026. He accepted his option for 2025, meaning the Cubs are set to pay him $27.5 million. The belief around the league is that the Cubs are actively trying to trade Bellinger, according to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal. ""While rival executives say the Chicago Cubs want to trade first baseman/outfielder Cody Bellinger, they also note the difficulty the team likely will face pulling off such a move,"" wrote Rosenthal. ""They should be able to pull off a trade, but it may look more like a salary dump than trading somebody who was an MVP candidate in 2023,"" wrote Pressnell. ""A team like the New York Yankees or New York Mets makes sense as a landing destination, depending on where Juan Soto lands."" Bellinger is a good player, but the Cubs need an upgrade at first base. With Pete Alonso available, they need as much room to spend as possible. The Cubs could also target a guy like Blake Snell or Max Fried. Regardless of who they target, Bellinger's contract on the payroll is not going to help them out.

Both fighters demonstrate particular prowess in the striking department, with each having sharp combination attacks and rare knockout power for the flyweight division. The aspect of their games which is not rare for 125-lbs is their grappling ability, as both young athletes can also defend takedowns, scramble like their life depends on it, and even attack with their own grappling.  Jose and Lone’er are making their UFC debut at 23 and 25-years old, respectively, which can bring mental pressure that could cause one fighter to have an off-night, but on paper this should be a close bout. As a result, the -370 betting line in the favor of Kavanaugh is somewhat confusing. Kavanaugh has one of the greatest regional highlight-reel knockouts ever, it is true, and has faced a difficult level of competition for such a young fighter, having won five straight against undefeated opponents like another top prospect in An Tuan Ho.

The knees from Ochoa could be devastating. His kicking defense is good, but the timing and bouncy movement of Kavanaugh could still allow Lone'er to build up attrition throughout the fight by chipping away at the Peruvian’s legs.  José ""Ochoa"" (7-0), el mayor prospecto peruano de la actualidad, debuta este sábado en UFC ante Lon'er Kavanagh en un duelo de invictos que tiene pinta de ser la mejor pelea de la semana. Gracias UFC por darnos peleas así 🫡. pic.twitter.com/e4ctaXJgPg The main weakness for Kavanaugh is that he often gets caught up in his own offensive dynamism, which results in dropping his hands when really getting into his flow with combinations. His in-and-out, flow-based style is gorgeous to watch, but a foe like Ochoa could be the one to catch the chin of Lone'er. Despite Kavanaugh’s strength of schedule, he has not faced a power hitter like Jose Ochoa before.  I do still expect Lone'er Kavanaugh to dispatch Jose Ochoa by competitive decision and continue his ascent towards the stiff competition in the flyweight rankings.

Perhaps that could lead to some unexpected fireworks. Last winter, the Phillies focused more on locking in their existing core than bringing in outside free agents. They thought their roster was good enough to win a World Series in 2024, and it couldn't get the job done once the playoffs rolled around. This time around, the Phillies must go for broke. They need to win at least one championship in the Bryce Harper era, and the best way to do so could be to shock the sport with a blockbuster trade. The top trade target in Major League Baseball this winter is Chicago White Sox left-hander Garrett Crochet, who could make any team's rotation better. Crochet, a 2024 All-Star, racked up an impressive 209 strikeouts in his first year as a full-time starting pitcher. Elijah Evans of Just Baseball recently proposed a deal that would send Crochet to Philadelphia for catcher Eduardo Tait, shortstop Starlyn Caba, outfielder Gabriel Rincones Jr., and right-handed pitcher Michael Mercado. ""Cristopher Sanchez is far from a lock to maintain his elite numbers and Ranger Suarez was brutal in the later portion of the season. Securing another star arm to slot in behind Zack Wheeler, while having Andrew Painter on the way, would make this the best rotation in baseball heading into 2025,"" Evans said. ""(The trade) presents Chicago with two core pieces for the distant future when they hope to be competitive again. A third piece that is closer to being league-ready would need to be added in for a little bit of safety, but this deal would be the upside swing type for Chicago."" Tait and Caba are Just Baseball's No. 52 and No. 72 overall prospects, so giving up both would hurt the Phillies' future outlook on the position player side, but acquiring a true ace like Crochet necessitates giving up something of value.  If the lefty continues to pitch the way he did in 2024, a deal like this could turn the Phillies into instant title favorites. They've got to get the job done in the playoffs somehow, and having Crochet in their corner might just be the thing that puts them over the top.

[&#8230;]","Betting on sports isn’t just about luck—it’s a skill, a blend of strategy, research, and discipline that separates consistent winners from those who are just chasing the thrill. If you’re tired of leaving your wagers to chance, it’s time to sharpen your approach with some smart tips for betting on sports and beating the odds. Let’s dive into the tips for betting on sports that can transform your bets into a more calculated and profitable endeavor. First things first: knowledge is power. Betting blindly on your favorite team because you’re emotionally invested is a recipe for disaster. You need to approach every bet with cold, hard logic. Start by researching the teams, players, and stats. Look at recent form, head-to-head records, injuries, and even the weather if it’s a factor. A bettor armed with data is far more dangerous than one relying on gut feelings. Speaking of odds, always shop around. Different bookmakers offer varying odds for the same events, and those slight differences can add up over time. Use odds comparison websites to find the best value for your bets. Remember, your goal is to get the most return for the risk you’re taking. Never settle for less when better odds are just a click away. Bankroll management is the cornerstone of smart sports betting. Set aside a specific amount of money for betting, and never exceed it. A good rule of thumb is to wager no more than 1-5% of your bankroll on a single bet. This strategy ensures you can weather losing streaks without going broke. Treat your bankroll like an investment fund—guard it with discipline and never bet impulsively. Avoid chasing losses. It’s easy to let frustration dictate your decisions after a string of bad bets. But doubling down in an attempt to recoup losses often leads to bigger mistakes. Stick to your strategy, and remember that sports betting is a marathon, not a sprint. Consistency is what builds long-term success. Diversify your bets. Sure, single bets on match outcomes are straightforward, but they’re not the only game in town. Explore other markets like over/under goals, player props, or handicap betting. These options can provide better value, especially in games where the outcome seems too close to call. And if you’re feeling adventurous, accumulators can offer big payouts—just remember, they’re high-risk and require all selections to hit. Live betting is another arena where smart bettors can gain an edge. Watching a game unfold in real time gives you insights that pre-match stats can’t provide. You might notice a team dominating possession or a key player struggling with form. Use this information to make more informed in-play bets. Just be cautious—live betting moves fast, so stay focused and avoid impulsive decisions. Know when to walk away. Sometimes, the smartest bet is the one you don’t place. If the odds don’t offer value, or if you’re unsure about an event, it’s better to pass. There’s always another game, another opportunity. Forcing bets out of boredom or desperation is a surefire way to drain your bankroll. Stay informed about promotions and bonuses. Many bookmakers offer free bets, enhanced odds, or cashback deals, especially for new customers. While these offers can’t guarantee wins, they’re great for reducing risk or increasing potential returns. Just make sure to read the terms and conditions—hidden restrictions can limit your ability to profit. Finally, keep your emotions in check. Betting is exciting, but it can also be frustrating when things don’t go your way. Remember, even the smartest punters don’t win every time. Success comes from sticking to your strategy, staying disciplined, and learning from both wins and losses. Betting on sports should be fun, but it’s also a test of patience and resilience. Smart sports betting isn’t about making reckless wagers in the heat of the moment. It’s about playing the long game, finding value, and managing your bankroll wisely. With these tips, you’ll be better equipped to beat the odds and enjoy the thrill of betting with a sharper edge."

Betting odds serve two purposes: they indicate the probability of an event happening and determine the payout you’ll receive if your bet wins. Different regions and platforms use different formats for odds, but the underlying principle remains the same. The three most common odds formats are: To calculate profit with decimal odds, use this formula:
Profit = (Odds x Stake) – Stake Odds also reflect implied probability, which is how likely a bookmaker thinks an outcome is. The lower the odds, the higher the perceived probability. For example: To calculate implied probability, use these formulas: For example: Bookmakers often build a margin (called the overround) into the odds to ensure they profit regardless of the outcome. This means the combined implied probabilities for all outcomes in a market will usually exceed 100%. Calculating your payout is crucial for managing your bets and spotting value. Here’s how to calculate total return and profit for each odds format: Understanding odds isn’t just about payouts; it’s also about spotting value. A value bet occurs when you believe an outcome is more likely than the odds suggest. For example, if a bookmaker offers odds of 3.00 (33.33% implied probability) on a team you estimate has a 50% chance of winning, that’s a value bet. Mastering how odds work and calculating payouts is essential for smart betting. Whether you’re using fractional, decimal, or American odds, the principles remain the same: understand the implied probability, calculate your potential return, and look for value. Armed with this knowledge, you’ll have a clearer path to smarter, more strategic wagers."

It’s the difference between walking away empty-handed and salvaging some value from your bet, even when things don’t go as planned. But how does it work, and how can you make the most of it? Let’s break it down. First, what is accumulator insurance? At its core, it’s a feature offered by many bookmakers that refunds your stake—usually as a free bet—if one leg of your accumulator fails. For example, imagine you’ve placed a five-leg accumulator. Four of your selections win, but the last one lets you down. Without insurance, that’s game over. With accumulator insurance, you’ll get your stake back to try again, giving you a second chance to strike it big. The appeal is obvious. Accumulators are already high-risk, high-reward bets. Adding insurance reduces some of that risk, giving punters more confidence to go for those juicy payouts. It’s like jumping out of a plane with a backup parachute—sure, it doesn’t guarantee success, but it gives you a lifeline when things go wrong. Now, how do you use accumulator insurance effectively? First, know the rules. Each bookmaker has specific terms for their insurance offers. Most require a minimum number of legs—typically four or five—and a minimum odds threshold for each selection. For instance, your bets might need to be at least 1.5 odds (or 1/2 in fractional terms) to qualify. Be sure to read the fine print before placing your bet; otherwise, you could miss out on the insurance altogether. Accumulator insurance is best suited for mid-sized accumulators. A bet with three legs might not have the payout potential to justify the risk, while an accumulator with 10 legs is a Hail Mary that even insurance might struggle to salvage. Stick to bets with four to six selections for the sweet spot of reasonable risk and significant reward. Consider this scenario: you’ve crafted a five-leg football accumulator with carefully chosen selections. Arsenal to win, Manchester United to draw, over 2.5 goals in a Bayern Munich match, PSG to keep a clean sheet, and Real Madrid to win by a margin of two goals. If all but one of these hits, your accumulator insurance kicks in, giving you back your stake—usually as a free bet. Without it, you’d be kicking yourself over that one misstep. To maximize your use of accumulator insurance, combine it with smart betting strategies. Don’t just throw in random teams to bulk up your bet; research every selection. Look at form, injuries, head-to-head records, and other variables that could sway the outcome. The stronger your picks, the less likely you’ll need the insurance—but it’s always there as a safety net. Another pro tip: be mindful of cash-out offers. Some bookmakers let you cash out on accumulators before the final leg if things are looking dicey. However, using cash-out typically voids your accumulator insurance. Weigh the options carefully—sometimes taking a partial payout is better than relying on insurance, especially if the cash-out value is high. So, is accumulator insurance worth it? Absolutely, especially for punters who love the thrill of big accumulators but hate the frustration of losing everything on one bad result. It’s a feature that rewards the bold while giving you a little breathing room when luck doesn’t go your way. Accumulator insurance doesn’t guarantee wins, but it guarantees a softer landing. And in the chaotic, unpredictable world of betting, that’s a lifeline worth having. Use it wisely, pair it with smart selections, and you’ll give yourself the best shot at turning near-misses into a profitable betting experience."
Sports Weez,How to Build a Winning Betting Accumulator Every Time,https://sportsweez.com/betting-accumulator/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 08:47:32 +0000","Winning a betting accumulator is the stuff of dreams, but it’s no stroll in the park. Building one that lands consistently? That’s like chasing a unicorn on roller skates. Yet, with strategy, patience, and a touch of cunning, you can tilt the odds in your favor and make that elusive win feel less like luck [&#8230;]","Winning a betting accumulator is the stuff of dreams, but it’s no stroll in the park. Building one that lands consistently? That’s like chasing a unicorn on roller skates. Yet, with strategy, patience, and a touch of cunning, you can tilt the odds in your favor and make that elusive win feel less like luck and more like skill. Let’s cut to the chase: an accumulator is a single bet combining multiple outcomes. To win, every selection in your bet must be correct. If even one leg crumbles, your accumulator does too. But the payout? That’s the reason punters keep coming back for more—it’s an Everest of potential winnings compared to the molehill of a single bet. So, how do you craft an accumulator that doesn’t fall apart at the first hurdle? First, don’t let ambition blind you. The temptation to throw in ten or more selections because the odds look tasty is a rookie mistake. Keep it tight. A three- to five-leg accumulator strikes the perfect balance between risk and reward. Think of it like stacking Jenga blocks; the taller the tower, the shakier it gets. Next, stay in your lane. If football is your forte, stick to it. Betting on sports you barely understand is like diving into shark-infested waters with a paper life raft. Know the leagues, the teams, the players, and the dynamics. Dive into stats—head-to-head records, recent form, injuries, and even weather conditions. Yes, a rain-soaked pitch can turn a sure-fire goal fest into a snooze fest. Another golden rule? Bet on markets you understand. Don’t overcomplicate things with obscure bets like “first-half corners” or “to win from behind” unless you’re a seasoned analyst. Simple bets—match winners, over/under goals, or both teams to score (BTTS)—are your bread and butter. They’re predictable, easier to analyze, and less prone to chaotic surprises. Discipline is your best friend. When building an accumulator, you might feel tempted to add “just one more” to crank up the odds. Resist it. Greed is the graveyard of accumulators. If you’re eyeing a decent payout with your current selections, don’t sabotage yourself for the sake of a marginally bigger reward. Timing is everything. Bookmakers release odds early, but they shift as kickoff approaches. Keep an eye on these changes—they often reveal crucial information like team news or shifting public sentiment. If a star striker suddenly sits out due to injury, you’ll be glad you waited before locking in your bet. Let’s talk value. It’s easy to pick heavy favorites and stack them into an accumulator, but this strategy rarely works. Why? The combined odds are often so low that the risk isn’t worth the reward. Instead, focus on teams or outcomes that are undervalued by the bookmakers. Spotting a gem—like an in-form underdog playing at home—is where the real skill lies. Bookmaker features can also tilt things in your favor. Cash-out options allow you to lock in profits if most of your selections have landed but you’re nervous about the final leg. Accumulator insurance is another game-changer. It refunds your stake (as a free bet) if one selection lets you down, softening the sting of near-misses. Here’s an example of a smart accumulator strategy: This approach blends reliability with value without pushing your luck. Finally, let’s address the emotional roller coaster. Accumulators are meant to be fun. You’re chasing a big win, sure, but don’t let losses ruin your day—or your bank account. Never bet more than you can afford to lose. Set limits and stick to them. Winning is thrilling, but the true art of accumulator betting lies in the chase, the calculation, and the adrenaline of watching those results roll in. When you win—and you will win if you play smart—don’t forget to savor it. That victory isn’t just luck. It’s the product of careful planning, solid research, and a sprinkling of good fortune. And there’s no better feeling than seeing all your selections hit and realizing that, for once, the house didn’t win."

Miss [&#8230;]","An accumulator in betting isn’t just a wager; it’s a gambler’s roller coaster ride of pure adrenaline and potential payouts that make your jaw drop. Picture this: instead of betting on a single outcome, you stack multiple selections into one colossal bet. To win, every single pick in your accumulator needs to come through. Miss just one, and the entire bet is toast. It’s high-risk, high-reward—like trying to balance on a tightrope over a pit of gold. Now, why would anyone take on such a nerve-wracking gamble? Simple: the payouts. Accumulators are the holy grail for punters who dream big. The odds for each selection in the bet are multiplied together, meaning even small stakes can lead to eye-popping returns. Bet £5 on a four-leg accumulator with combined odds of 25/1, and you’re looking at a potential £130 payout. It’s the kind of bet that makes you daydream about that impossible holiday or a shiny new car. But here’s the catch—betting accumulators are a ruthless mistress. You could hit three out of four selections, only for your last one to falter in injury time. Sound familiar? That’s because bookmakers thrive on accumulators. The more legs (or selections) you add, the harder it becomes to win. Each added game introduces another layer of unpredictability, like a Jenga tower teetering closer to collapse. Let’s make it relatable. Imagine you’ve bet on four football matches: Manchester United to win, Arsenal to draw, Real Madrid to score over 2.5 goals, and PSG to win without conceding. If all four happen, you’re laughing all the way to the bank. But if Arsenal’s defense decides to nap and concede a late goal, say goodbye to your payout. You didn’t just lose on Arsenal—you lost it all. This is the bittersweet beauty of the accumulator. So, how do you play the game smartly? First, know your sport. Accumulators work best when you’re confident in your picks. Blindly throwing darts at fixtures is a recipe for heartbreak. Do your homework—check stats, form, injuries, and anything else that gives you an edge. Also, don’t get greedy. Sure, an eight-leg accumulator sounds enticing, but the odds are astronomically against you. Sometimes, a modest three-leg bet is the smarter move. Some bookmakers also offer insurance or cash-out options. Acca insurance means if one leg fails, you might still get your stake back as a free bet. Cash-out lets you claim winnings early if most of your picks are coming through, but you’re nervous about the last game. These features can be lifesavers, especially when your nerves are shot watching that final match unfold. There’s also a psychological side to accumulators. It’s not just about the money—it’s the thrill, the camaraderie of comparing bets with your friends, and the gut-wrenching tension as results roll in. Winning an accumulator is a story you tell for years, a badge of honor in the betting world. Losing, on the other hand, is a humbling lesson in how cruel sports can be. At the heart of it, accumulators are for the bold. They’re not for those looking for steady, consistent wins. But if you’re chasing that moment where everything clicks, where your selections align like stars in a lucky constellation, then accumulators are your playground. Just remember: the house always has the edge, so bet with your head, not over it."

A Beginner’s Guide,https://sportsweez.com/sports-betting-spread/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 08:30:55 +0000","Sports betting spread, often referred to as the point spread, is one of the most popular and widely used forms of wagering, especially in sports like football and basketball.

[&#8230;]","Sports betting spread, often referred to as the point spread, is one of the most popular and widely used forms of wagering, especially in sports like football and basketball. It’s designed to level the playing field between two teams, giving bettors a more balanced way to wager on games where one team is heavily favored. Whether you’re a beginner or just curious, understanding how spreads work is essential to placing smarter bets. The spread is essentially a margin of victory set by oddsmakers. It assigns a handicap to the favorite (the team expected to win) and an advantage to the underdog (the team expected to lose). Bettors wager on whether a team will “cover the spread,” meaning they either exceed the margin set by the bookmakers (favorites) or stay within it (underdogs). Here’s a classic example: In this scenario: The spread creates an even contest for bettors, no matter how lopsided the matchup might seem. It’s not about which team wins or loses—it’s about the margin of victory or defeat. Understanding spread numbers and symbols is simple once you get the hang of it: For instance, if the spread is set at 7 points: If the spread is a whole number (e.g., 7 instead of 6.5) and the favorite wins by exactly the spread margin, it’s called a push, and your stake is returned. Point spreads are designed to create balanced betting markets. If one team is much stronger than the other, a simple moneyline bet on the favorite would offer little value, while the underdog would seem like a hopeless gamble. By introducing a spread, bookmakers make both sides of the bet more appealing. For example: Betting on the spread is straightforward: The point spread is one of the most exciting ways to bet on sports, as it levels the playing field and makes every game competitive from a betting perspective. By understanding how spreads work and learning to analyze games critically, you can approach spread betting with confidence and improve your chances of success."

It’s a sharp, calculated method that leverages discrepancies in odds offered by different bookmakers to ensure you make money no matter the outcome of an event. Sounds like a dream, right? Well, it is—but it’s also a high-stakes game that requires precision, speed, and stealth. At its core, arbing works by exploiting the gaps in odds. Bookmakers, each with their own way of calculating probabilities, occasionally post odds that overlap in a way that creates an arbitrage opportunity. When this happens, you can bet on all possible outcomes of an event across different bookies and secure a profit regardless of the result. It’s not gambling in the traditional sense—it’s mathematics, pure and simple. Here’s a quick example to show how arbing works. Imagine a tennis match between Player A and Player B. One bookmaker offers odds of 2.1 for Player A to win, while another offers odds of 2.2 for Player B. By staking strategically on both outcomes, you ensure that your total payout will exceed your total stake. For instance, if you place £50 on Player A at 2.1 and £47.62 on Player B at 2.2, you’d receive £105 no matter who wins, securing a risk-free profit of £7.38. The key lies in finding and acting on these discrepancies before the odds shift. But here’s the catch: arbing isn’t as simple as sitting back and watching the cash roll in. It requires dedication, quick thinking, and a deep understanding of how odds and markets work. Successful arbers are like digital treasure hunters, constantly scouring betting markets or using specialized arbitrage software to find opportunities before they vanish. These gaps in odds are often fleeting, lasting mere minutes before bookmakers adjust their lines. To get started with arbing, you’ll need accounts with multiple bookmakers, a reliable arbitrage betting calculator, and a bankroll that can withstand large stakes to maximize returns. The more bookmakers you’re registered with, the higher your chances of spotting profitable arbitrage opportunities. It’s also essential to familiarize yourself with betting terms and different odds formats (decimal, fractional, and American), as arbing often requires quick conversions and calculations. But let’s talk about the elephant in the room: why doesn’t everyone arb if it’s so foolproof? The answer lies in the risks and limitations. First, while arbing is theoretically risk-free, real-world execution can be tricky. Odds can shift mid-bet, leaving you exposed. One bookmaker might limit your account, suspecting you of arbing, or cancel a bet outright. Currency conversions, withdrawal fees, and delays can eat into your profits, especially if you’re working across international bookies. Then there’s the time investment. Arbing is not a passive income stream—it’s a grind. You need to monitor markets, act fast, and constantly stay ahead of bookmakers who frown upon this practice. In fact, many bookmakers have systems to detect and restrict arbers, limiting stakes or banning accounts outright. It’s a high-pressure game, and while the profits are real, so are the challenges. For those willing to put in the work, arbing can be incredibly rewarding. It’s not about luck or gut feelings—it’s about logic, analysis, and precision. Every arb you place is like solving a puzzle, a tiny victory in the battle of wits against the bookies. And when done right, the profits can snowball into a consistent, risk-free income stream. If you’re considering trying your hand at arbing, start small. Use free arbitrage calculators available online to practice spotting opportunities. Build a network of bookmaker accounts, diversify your bets, and, above all, stay under the radar. Remember, arbing isn’t illegal, but bookmakers are private businesses, and they can close your account if they suspect you’re playing their game too well. Arbing is not for everyone—it’s a demanding, fast-paced pursuit that rewards the meticulous and the determined. But for those who crack the code, it’s a way to turn the unpredictable world of betting into a science, delivering profits that don’t rely on chance. And in the world of gambling, that’s about as close to magic as it gets."

<h1>Zary Seals Flames' Triumph, Rangers Suffer Second Road Loss</h1>
<p>On a thrilling Thursday night, the <a href=""https://21sports.com/dustin-wolf-shines-bright-flames-edge-predators-in-a-goalkeepers-duel/"">Calgary Flames</a> clinched a 3-2 victory over the New York Rangers, thanks to Connor Zary's crucial goal in the third period. <a href=""https://21sports.com/calgarys-flames-ignite-in-overtime-coronato-leads-to-3-2-victory-over-canadiens/"">Matt Coronato</a> and Yegor Sharangovich contributed significantly with each adding a goal and an assist to the Flames' tally. MacKenzie Weegar demonstrated some impressive playmaking skills with three assists.</p>
<h2>Jonathan Huberdeau Achieves Milestone, Dustin Wolf Shines Between the Pipes</h2>
<p>Jonathan Huberdeau, another star for the Flames, hit a significant milestone by bagging his 500th career assist. In the net, Dustin Wolf stood tall, blocking 27 shots, marking his third consecutive victory.</p>
<p>For the Rangers, Alexis Lafreniere and Will Cuylle found the back of the net in a quick succession of just 16 seconds in the second period. Despite the loss, it's worth noting that this is only the second road game the Rangers have lost this season. Goalie Igor Shesterkin remained resilient, saving 46 shots.</p>
<h3>Key Play: Zary's Game-Changing Goal</h3>
<p>The game-changing moment came at 10:34 of the third period when Zary, who had been active on the ice throughout the game, shrugged off a challenge from Kaapo Kakko. He managed to lift the puck over Shesterkin, scoring what would be the game-winning goal.</p>
<h2>Takeaways from the Game</h2>
<p>The Flames showcased their best first period of the season, outshooting the Rangers 20-5. Despite this, they held only a slim one-goal lead heading into the second period. Their power play, which had been lackluster in November, came alive and produced an essential goal for the second game in a row.</p>
<p>The Rangers, on the other hand, relied heavily on their goalkeeper Shesterkin to keep them in the game. Their progress was hindered by four penalties within the first 29 minutes, stalling their momentum.</p>
<h3>Breaking Down the Numbers</h3>
<p>The Flames achieved a feat of 20-plus shots in the first period for the first time since October 25, 2022, when they registered a similar number against Pittsburgh.</p>
<h2>What's Next for Flames and Rangers?</h2>
<p>The Flames will be looking to continue their winning streak at home against the Minnesota Wild on Saturday. The Rangers will conclude their four-game road trip on the same day, facing off against the Edmonton Oilers.</p>

<h1>Chicago Blackhawks Overcome Florida Panthers in Thrilling 3-1 Encounter</h1>
<p>Petr Mrazek's goaltending prowess was on full display as he thwarted 32 shots, while Teuvo Teravainen found the net, paving the way for the <a href=""https://21sports.com/kurashevs-ot-heroics-snap-blackhawks-slump-against-wild/"">Chicago Blackhawks</a> to soar past the <a href=""https://21sports.com/florida-panthers-claw-their-way-to-victory-shutting-out-nhl-leading-winnipeg-jets-5-0/"">Florida Panthers</a> with a 3-1 victory on Thursday evening. Craig Smith and Nick Foligno also inked their names on the scoreboard, enabling Chicago to halt a hat-trick of consecutive losses. This victory also bolstered their home record to 3-5-0 for the season.</p>
<h2>Mrazek's Impressive Return to Lineup</h2>
<p>Mrazek made a triumphant return to the Blackhawks' lineup after sitting out Tuesday's 3-2 defeat to the Panthers due to personal reasons. He was a pivotal force in Chicago's victory, stopping numerous shots with impeccable skill and precision.</p>
<h2>Teravainen's Power-Play Goal Sets the Tone</h2>
<p>Teravainen set the Blackhawks on the path to victory with an early power-play goal, just 2:46 into the opening period. This marked only his second goal in his recent 17 appearances. Smith later doubled the lead, skillfully converting a breakaway into a goal, thanks to Pat Maroon's assist, 10:07 into the second period. This marked Smith's fifth goal for the campaign.</p>
<h3>Reinhart's Lone Goal for Florida</h3>
<p>Sam Reinhart, for the Panthers, managed to net his 15th goal of the season, marking his fourth in the last five games. Despite Florida's efforts to equalize in the final moments, Foligno sealed the deal for the Blackhawks with a decisive empty-netter with just a minute left on the clock.</p>
<h2>Panthers' Missed Opportunities</h2>
<p>Despite a couple of golden opportunities, the Panthers couldn't capitalize, leaving the ice empty-handed. The Stanley Cup champions, with Spencer Knight stopping 17 shots, experienced their fourth loss in five games.</p>
<h2>Blackhawks' Resilient Response</h2>
<p>Blackhawks' coach Luke Richardson was on the lookout for a more spirited performance from his team following their capitulation of a 2-1 lead in the third period against the Ducks. His team did not disappoint, presenting a resilient front, particularly in the game's final stages.</p>
<h3>Key Moment of the Game</h3>
<p>A noteworthy moment of the game came when Blackhawks' defenseman Wyatt Kaiser was benched for delay of game 12:22 into the third period. Despite this setback, the Blackhawks successfully killed off the penalty, rendering the Panthers' power-play opportunities futile.</p>
<h3>Key Statistic</h3>
<p>Foligno boasts an impressive record against Florida, with 10 goals and 14 assists to his name in his career against them.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>The Panthers are set to kick off a three-game homestand against Colorado on Saturday night, while the Blackhawks will travel to Philadelphia for their next game on Saturday.</p>

<h1>St. Louis Blues Snatch Victory from Sharks, Putting an End to Home Losing Streak</h1>
<p>Jake Neighbours emerged as the shootout star, while Jordan Binnington defied all three attempts by the <a href=""https://21sports.com/robertson-shines-bright-as-dallas-stars-overpower-san-jose-sharks/"">San Jose Sharks</a>, leading the <a href=""https://21sports.com/st-louis-blues-triumph-over-tampa-bay-lightning-in-thrilling-ice-showdown/"">St. Louis Blues</a> to a 3-2 triumph on Thursday night. This win ended a four-game home losing streak for the Blues. Binnington displayed resilience by bouncing back from Alexander Wennberg's equalizing goal with only 8.8 seconds remaining, securing his 151st career victory. This tied him with Mike Liut's franchise record.</p>
<h2>Standout Performances</h2>
<p>Wennberg was the lone double-goalscorer for the Sharks, with Mikael Granlund and <a href=""https://21sports.com/macklin-celebrinis-overtime-goal-fuels-san-jose-sharks-victory-over-detroit-red-wings/"">Macklin Celebrini</a>, the 2024 NHL draft's top pick, providing assists for both goals. For the Blues, Jordan Kyrou and Nathan Walker found the back of the net during regulation time. This marked only the second victory in their last nine matches.</p>
<p>Walker's goal came just 11 seconds into the game, thanks to Radek Faksa's interception of a pass from Sharks' goalie Yaroslav Askarov. Later, Kyrou, positioned between Granlund and Timothy Liljegren, nudged home a pass from Pierre-Olivier Joseph for his sixth goal of the season, with 8:13 remaining in the second.</p>
<h2>Goalkeeper Highlights</h2>
<p>Binnington held the fort with 22 saves, contributing significantly to the Blues' victory, while Askarov managed 29 saves.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<p>The Sharks, who have been outscored 28-10 in the season's first period, struggled from the onset, despite netting a first-period goal for the third consecutive game. On the other hand, Binnington, with 295 games under his belt, stands second among goalies in Blues' franchise history. He reached the 151-win milestone in 56 fewer games than Liut, whose record from 1979-1985 stood at 151-133, with 52 ties.</p>
<h3>Game-Changing Moment</h3>
<p>Neighbours played the hero, delivering the shootout victory with a wrist shot that outsmarted Askarov on his glove side.</p>
<h3>Key Statistics</h3>
<p>The Blues have been outscored 14-2 in the third period across their last seven games.</p>
<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>The Blues are set to play seven out of their next eight games on the road, commencing Saturday against the New York Islanders. The Sharks, on the other hand, will start a four-game homestand against Buffalo the same day.</p>

<h1>Werenski's Overtime Goal Brings Columbus Blue Jackets a Remarkable Comeback Victory</h1>
<p>Zach Werenski's masterstroke at 1:25 of the overtime session marked the climax of a thrilling game as the <a href=""https://21sports.com/los-angeles-kings-emerge-victorious-in-dominant-performance-against-columbus-blue-jackets/"">Columbus Blue Jackets</a> overcame a three-goal deficit to triumph over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/vasilevskiy-shines-with-stellar-saves-as-lightning-strike-devils-4-0/"">Tampa Bay Lightning</a>, in an electrifying 7-6 victory on Thursday night. Werenski, shining in the spotlight, equalized the game at 4 in the second period and contributed with three assists, helping the Blue Jackets secure their second consecutive win.</p>
<h2>Key Players in the Clash</h2>
<p>Sean Monahan and Dmitri Voronkov greatly supported their team with a goal and three assists and a goal plus an assist, respectively. Kent Johnson, returning from an injury hiatus that had sidelined him for 14 games, made his mark with a power play and a short-handed goal. Yegor Chinakhov added another goal to the tally while Elvis Merzlikins showcased his goalkeeping skills by blocking 24 shots.</p>
<p>For the Lightning, Anthony Cirelli, Mitchell Chaffee, Brandon Hagel, and Connor Geekie all performed valiantly, each securing a goal and an assist. <a href=""https://21sports.com/brayden-points-dazzling-return-sparks-lightnings-overtime-triumph-over-penguins/"">Brayden Point</a> and Cam Atkinson also added to the scoresheet, with Nikita Kucherov assisting thrice. Jonas Johansson showed resilience with 36 saves.</p>
<h3>Game Highlights</h3>
<p>Despite Tampa Bay's seemingly smooth sailing after netting three early goals, they couldn't sustain their lead. The Blue Jackets, back on their home turf after seven out of their last eight games on the road, retaliated fiercely with four goals in the second period.</p>
<p>The game's pivotal moment was undoubtedly when Tampa Bay, leading by three goals in the first period, found themselves under fire in the second period. Columbus turned the tables, scoring four times and Tampa only twice.</p>
<h3>Notable Stats</h3>
<p>Brayden Point, in his second game after a four-match absence due to a lower-body injury, scored a power-play goal just 23 seconds into a Columbus penalty, at 1:51 of the first period. Point has now netted three times in two games, tying with Nikita Kucherov for the team lead with 11.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>Both teams will return to the ice on Saturday night. The Lightning will face Dallas at home, while the Blue Jackets prepare to host Carolina.</p>

<h1>Colorado Avalanche Triumphs Over Washington Capitals in Nail-Biting Encounter</h1>
<h2>Miles Wood Fires Avalanche to Victory</h2>
<p>In an electrifying Thursday night showdown, Colorado Avalanche clinched a tight 2-1 win over <a href=""https://21sports.com/capitals-dominate-avalanche-in-thrilling-5-2-victory-a-night-of-twists-and-triumphs/"">Washington Capitals</a>, with Miles Wood playing the hero as his third-period goal became the decider. Mikko Rantanen, another Avalanche star, also found the net, marking the team's fifth victory in their last six outings.</p>
<h2>Alexandar Georgiev Continues Winning Streak</h2>
<p>Alexandar Georgiev, the formidable Avalanche goaltender, demonstrated his mettle with an awe-inspiring performance that saw him repel 29 shots. This marked his fourth consecutive win after returning from an upper-body injury that sidelined him for two games.</p>
<h2>Capitals Feel the Absence of Ovechkin</h2>
<p>For the Capitals, it was Pierre-Luc Dubois who scored, but the team's winning spree came to an abrupt end, halting at three victories. Logan Thompson, the Capitals goalkeeper, experienced his maiden regulation loss of the season with 25 saves. Earlier, the team was dealt a significant blow as Alex Ovechkin, their superstar, was ruled out for four to six weeks due to a broken left fibula, sustained during their Monday clash against Utah.</p>
<h3>Avalanche's Takeaways</h3>
<p>Despite Nathan MacKinnon failing to score for the second time in three games — both against the Capitals — Rantanen maintained his impressive form, securing points in five of his last six games.</p>
<h3>Capitals' Takeaways</h3>
<p>Without Ovechkin's presence, the Capitals found it difficult to generate momentum offensively. Their usually effective power play, often energized by their captain, went 0 for 2.</p>
<h2>Key Moment of the Match</h2>
<p>The defining moment came just 3:29 into the third period when Wood, positioned at the front of the net, deflected Cale Makar's point shot, sending it past Thompson for the lead.</p>
<h2>Crucial Statistic</h2>
<p>A telling statistic dating back to the 2021-22 season reveals that the Capitals have a dismal 4-14 record without <a href=""https://21sports.com/ovechkins-decisive-strike-propels-capitals-to-victory-over-predators/"">Ovechkin</a> in the team. At the time of his injury, the captain was leading the league with 15 goals, only 27 short of Wayne Gretzky's record.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>The Avalanche is set to square off against the reigning Stanley Cup champions, Florida, on Saturday, while the Capitals will host New Jersey.</p>

<h1>Golden Knights Prevail Over Senators in Hard-Fought Match</h1>
<p>In a hockey game that kept fans on the edge of their seats, the Vegas Golden Knights claimed victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/tkachuks-overtime-magic-propels-senators-to-victory-over-bruins/"">Ottawa Senators</a> with a nail-biting 3-2 score on Thursday night. Ilya Samsonov, who had let in 10 goals over his last two games, bounced back with a remarkable performance, pulling off 38 saves.</p>
<h2>Samsonov's Key Saves Halt Senators' Attack</h2>
<p>Despite the Senators' aggressive play, Samsonov held strong, making crucial saves against formidable players like Josh Norris, David Perron, Tim Stutzle, and Brady Tkachuk. The Senators (8-10-1) find themselves trapped in a four-game losing streak, having scored just two goals throughout their last three games.</p>
<h2>Golden Knights Gain the Upper Hand</h2>
<p>In the initial phase of the game, the Golden Knights (12-6-2) seized control when Linus Ullmark made a spectacular diving save but failed to reposition quickly enough. This left Jack Eichel with an unhindered shot to the net, marking his sixth goal this season. Brett Howden extended their lead to 2-0 in the mid-second period, slipping a goal past Ullmark, who had 29 saves in the game.</p>
<h3>Sensational Third-Period Action</h3>
<p>Adam Gaudette managed to get one past Samsonov 7:17 into the third period, narrowing the lead. However, the Senators' joy was short-lived as Pavel Dorofeyev restored the two-goal lead just two minutes later. Drake Batherson kept the Senators' hopes alive, scoring a goal off a Jake Sanderson rebound with a little over seven minutes left. Despite the Senators outshooting the Golden Knights 18-5 in the third period, they fell short of a comeback.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways and Statistics</h2>
<p>A recurring issue for the Senators has been their habit of conceding the first goal, which has led to eight consecutive losses and a dismal 1-9-1 record when they let in the first goal. On the other hand, the Golden Knights capitalized on an ill-timed Ottawa line change, delivering a swift counter-strike leading to Howden's goal. The Golden Knights have an impressive 12-1-1 track record against the Senators since their entry into the league in 2017.</p>
<h3>What's Next for Both Teams?</h3>
<p>Looking ahead, the Senators are gearing up to host the Vancouver Canucks on Saturday night, while the Golden Knights prepare to face off against the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<h1>A Nail-biting Victory for Detroit Red Wings against New York Islanders</h1>
<p>In a thrilling showdown, <a href=""https://21sports.com/lucas-raymond-inks-lucrative-eight-year-contract-with-detroit-red-wings/"">Lucas Raymond</a>'s incredible goal in the final seconds helped the Detroit Red Wings to a 2-1 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/islanders-thrilling-rally-overcoming-penguins-in-post-regulation-showdown/"">New York Islanders</a> on Thursday evening. Jonatan Berggren's crucial equalizer also played a pivotal role in breaking Detroit's run of three consecutive losses. The Red Wings' goaltender, Alex Lyon, displayed a remarkable performance with 22 saves.</p>
<p>For the Islanders, the only ray of hope came from Simon Holmstrom, who managed to score the sole goal for his team, unable to reverse their pattern of losses with five out of their last six games ending in defeat. Despite a valiant effort with 29 saves, Islanders' goalie Ilya Sorokin couldn't prevent the defeat.</p>
<h2>The Turning Points of the Game</h2>
<p>Holmstrom sparked the Islanders' spirits by scoring the first goal of the match at 5:51 of the first period, marking his third goal of the season. However, Berggren, with just 4:46 left in the game, managed to level the score with his third goal of the season. The decisive moment came when Raymond, with a skillful assist from Dylan Larkin, netted the puck from the left circle, beating Sorokin's glove with just 51 seconds to spare.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways from the Game</h3>
<p>The Islanders, despite having the league's worst penalty-kill entering the game, successfully thwarted three power plays from the Red Wings, who boast the second-best power play in the league. Sorokin was instrumental in this, making six crucial saves.</p>
<p>In contrast, Raymond, who had an impressive tally of 31 goals last season, ended his scoring drought with a game-winning goal in the final minute, providing a much-needed boost to the Red Wings.</p>
<h2>Flashback and Key Statistics</h2>
<p>Recalling the teams' first encounter last month, which saw the Red Wings triumph with a 1-0 victory thanks to Patrick Kane's first-period goal, it seemed history might repeat itself with Holmstrom's early goal. However, the Red Wings turned the tide with two goals in the final five minutes of the game.</p>
<p>A noteworthy stat from the game revolves around the Red Wings' knack for comebacks last season, boasting an 11-24-3 record when trailing after two periods. This season, however, they had a 0-8-0 record when down after two periods, a statistic they managed to overturn with their late rally in this game.</p>
<h3>What's Next for the Teams?</h3>
<p>Looking forward, the Islanders will be hosting St. Louis on Saturday, while the Red Wings will welcome Boston to their home ground.</p>

21Sports.com,Nick Chubb’s Heroic Comeback Powers Browns to Break Steelers’ Winning Streak,https://21sports.com/nick-chubbs-heroic-comeback-powers-browns-to-break-steelers-winning-streak/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 08:31:04 +0000","<p><img alt=""Pittsburgh Steelers"" class=""attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image"" height=""504"" src=""https://21sports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pittsburgh-Steelers.jpg"" width=""800"" /></p>
<h1>Nick Chubb Spearheads Cleveland Browns' Victory Over Pittsburgh Steelers</h1>
<p>In an intense blizzard, Nick Chubb drove his team forward, replicating the play that almost ended his career in Pittsburgh last year. Chubb's perseverance paid off with a memorable touchdown, the highlight of a game his teammates will cherish. In the dying seconds of the game, Chubb powered through for a 2-yard touchdown, leading the Cleveland Browns to a triumphant 24-19 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/steelers-snatch-victory-from-commanders-with-wilsons-late-game-heroics/"">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> on Thursday night. This victory snapped the Steelers' five-game winning spree.</p>
<h2>Chubb's Redemption Against the Steelers</h2>
<p>Chubb's electrifying performance came in his first encounter with the AFC North leaders, the Steelers (8-3), since suffering a season-ending left knee injury in a Monday night game against the same team in Week 2 last September. After a difficult rehab and a similar knee injury in 2015, Chubb's return to the field and scoring against the Steelers was a poetic moment.</p>
<h3>Myles Garrett's Praise for Chubb</h3>
<p><a href=""https://21sports.com/cleveland-browns-myles-garrett-battles-double-foot-injury-a-look-into-his-determination-and-future-prospects/"">Myles Garrett</a>, who made three impressive sacks, expressed his admiration for Chubb, “It meant a lot to me. I know it means a lot to him,” said Garrett. ""His resilience and his comeback in this game truly exemplify the kind of man he is. We absolutely love him.”</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Chubb had scored another 2-yard run. The Browns (3-8) managed to recover from blowing a 12-point lead in the fourth quarter and being down 19-18. With 3:22 left on the clock, the Browns got a chance when Pittsburgh punter Corliss Waitman made a 16-yard blunder.</p>
<h2>The Snowy Showdown</h2>
<p>In the midst of accumulating snow, Jameis Winston of the Browns completed a crucial third-down pass to Jerry Jeudy, reaching the Pittsburgh 9. Two plays later, it was Chubb who bulldozed his way into the end zone.</p>
<p>The Steelers had one last opportunity, but their Hail Mary on the final play was deflected by Browns safety Grant Delpit, triggering euphoria at Huntington Bank Field. This win against the Steelers provided some relief for coach Kevin Stefanski in a tough season and gave Browns fans a reason to celebrate.</p>
<h3>Victory Amidst the Snowstorm</h3>
<p>With a snowstorm transforming the field into a white canvas, the Steelers managed to wipe out an 18-6 deficit, scoring two touchdowns in a little over a minute. However, the Browns rallied back to secure their second divisional win after defeating the Ravens last month.</p>
<h3>Garrett's Outstanding Performance</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, Myles Garrett outshone Steelers star T.J. Watt in a dominant display, including a crucial strip-sack of Wilson. This performance came after Garrett made comments about Watt's apparent snub when Garrett was awarded the Defensive Player of the Year over him last season.</p>
<h2>Up Next</h2>
<p>The Steelers will face the Cincinnati Bengals on Dec. 1, while the Browns are scheduled to take on the Denver Broncos on Dec. 3.</p>

<h1>NHL Recap: Sabres Triumph Over Kings, 1-0, Amid Luukkonen's Stellar Performance</h1>
<h2>Luukkonen's Unyielding Defense</h2>
<p>Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, the formidable goaltender for the <a href=""https://21sports.com/thrilling-shootout-victory-sabres-douse-flames-in-nhl-showdown/"">Buffalo Sabres</a>, displayed an awe-inspiring performance, parrying 24 attempts on goal during their Wednesday night face-off against the <a href=""https://21sports.com/los-angeles-kings-emerge-victorious-in-dominant-performance-against-columbus-blue-jackets/"">Los Angeles Kings</a>. Despite recently recovering from a lower-body injury that saw him benched for two games, Luukkonen was unstoppable, denying six attempts in the first period, an equal number in the second, and a commanding 12 saves in the final period. This marked his first shutout of the season, contributing significantly to the Sabres' momentum with five victories in their last seven games.</p>
<h2>Zucker's Game-Changing Goal</h2>
<p>The game-changing moment arrived 38 seconds into the third period when Jason Zucker capitalized on a power play, expertly redirecting Rasmus Dahlin's shot past the Kings' goaltender David Rittich. This marked Zucker's fourth goal of the season, giving the Sabres their only, yet decisive, score of the game. Dahlin has been instrumental in the Sabres' recent power plays, having contributed points in the last four consecutive games. His assist on Zucker's goal extended his overall point streak to seven games, with an impressive tally of four goals and six assists.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways from the Game</h2>
<p>Despite the absence of their leading scorer, Tage Thompson, due to a lower-body injury, the Sabres managed to secure the win. Thompson, though missed for the third consecutive game, had returned to practice in the days leading up to the match.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Kings, who have been notoriously inconsistent in their performances since the start of the season, failed to turn the tides in their favor, dropping to a 5-2-1 record on home ice.</p>
<h2>Crucial Statistics and Next Steps</h2>
<p>Heading into the game, Buffalo's away power play stats stood at a lowly 2 for 19 (10.5%), ranking 30th in the NHL. However, a 1-for-3 performance in this game was enough to clinch the victory.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the Sabres will be facing off against Anaheim on Friday night, while the Kings are set to host Seattle on Saturday.</p>

Martin Truex Jr. may have retired as a full-time Cup Series competitor, but his journey as a racing driver is far from over. The former Joe Gibbs Racing veteran recently clarified that he intends to compete in the 2025 Daytona 500, even though it won’t be under the 23XI Racing banner. Having competed at NASCAR’s highest level for two decades, the 44-year-old is looking to get some well-earned rest, while keeping his passion for racing alive with one-off appearances. Besides wanting to be involved in the 2024 Cup Series season opener, Truex Jr. is interested in competing in the Xfinity Series as well. A trip to the grassroots is also within the realm of possibility, as the New Jersey native wants to participate in his home track race at the Wall Stadium as well, which hosts the Turkey Derby on Thanksgiving every year. While the veteran driver won’t miss being on the road for the majority of the year after retirement, living life away from the fast lane for too long isn’t a possibility the 2017 championship winner wants to consider at the moment. Appearing to be in good spirits at the 2024 NASCAR Awards, Martin Truex Jr. was asked if he was enjoying his retirement from full-time racing. The 44-year-old responded by saying, “Yeah, I do. I feel great. I’m happy and excited about the future. Still get to race a little bit as well. I don’t know if I’ll ever stop racing of some sort. Just very thankful, proud, and happy. Proud of a lot of things we’ve been able to do over the years. It’s been great.”  Let the world know your perspective.

Zion Williamson, once touted as a generational talent, has found himself at the center of fan backlash after a video of him getting a back tattoo went viral. While tattoos are far from controversial, the timing and context of this clip have enraged fans. With Zion’s fitness and availability for the Pelicans already under scrutiny, the sight of him appearing out of shape—with a noticeable belly—has only fueled frustrations. Many expected him to be laser-focused on rehabbing and conditioning to make a strong return, but instead, this clip has reignited debates about his priorities and long-term potential in the NBA. Adding to fans’ discontent, Zion’s return to action seems far from imminent. According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, the Pelicans star is “not close to a return” as he continues to deal with a hamstring injury. Williamson initially suffered the strain in a Nov. 6 loss to the Cavaliers after missing two games prior due to hamstring tightness. The Pelicans later announced he was out “indefinitely.” Charania further reports that he will be sidelined for an extended period.

Needless to say, this uncertainty surrounding Williamson’s recovery timeline has only compounded fan frustrations. One comment captured the growing sentiment: “At this point, does anyone really care? His career has been one of the most disappointing from what he was projected to be, and the NBA has moved on from him just like they did from Ja Morant. The 30 for 30 on their careers will be sad.”   At this point does anyone really care

The announcement of Joe Gibbs Racing’s (JGR) crew lineup for the 2025 season has sparked a wave of intrigue in NASCAR. In place of Chris Gabehart, Denny Hamlin will have a new crew chief Chris Gayle, who has been with JGR since 2005. JGR’s four teams will be overseen by Gabehart, who will be promoted to competition director. The news stunned Hamlin, who confessed to being “shocked”. Nevertheless, his response came amid a season of challenges for JGR. Hamlin, who did not request the change, will need time to adjust. As he spoke to reporters at the Charlotte Convention Center during the NASCAR awards ceremony, he appeared to be processing the unexpected announcement. The team has not yet revealed who will take over the No. 54 team, Gayle’s former position with JGR.

Additionally, JGR announced that Hamlin’s crew chief, Chris Gabehart, would be promoted to Competition Director. There is no crew chief on the No. 54 team right now, but the team intends to add one in the near future. Gibbs admitted to Fox Sports’ Bob Pockrass that he “hit a plateau” after working with Gayle and talked about the shift. “We hit a plateau for sure, but I don’t think nothing was off. I think that we still have a great relationship, and we’ve worked really hard this year, and I know they’ve worked extremely hard,” Gibbs said.   Ty Gibbs on whether he and crew chief Chris Gayle hit a plateau. Gayle will move to crew chief Denny Hamlin next year while Hamlin crew chief Chris Gabehart moves to competition director. A crew chief for Gibbs has not been determined. pic.twitter.com/Dd2k4IsHBs — Bob Pockrass (@bobpockrass) November 22, 2024 Expand Tweet  Gibbs finished 15th in the final standings after his second season in the Cup Series with 12 top-10 finishes and 8 top-five finishes. As well as the Coca-Cola 600 and Pocono, he won two pole positions this year. While keeping in account that the team put in a lot of effort, the 22-year-old pointed out the fact that changes are a natural part of the process.  Can Denny Hamlin thrive with a new crew chief, or is this change a risky gamble? Debate He added, “I think stuff changes. I think my grandfather won three Super Bowls with three different quarterbacks, so I think stuff changes, and it’s healthy. I think that it will work its way when Gabehart is going to go do this deal, so I’m hopefully excited for the future, and hopefully, we run really great next year in one of our races.”  For those unaware, Joe Gibbs won three Super Bowls with the Washington Commanders as their head coach! The 83-year-old was the coach of the team between 1981 and 1992 and won titles in 1982,1987 and 1991. He had a second stint on the team in the early 2000s, which was not as glittering as his first stint, but he did make the playoffs twice. This was more playoff appearances for the team than they had in the time between his two stints! He left the team once again in 2008, citing family obligations.  With his plethora of leadership experience, no one would dare to question Joe Gibbs’s decisions, and rather, people treat them with the utmost trust. Despite the tumultuous season for Joe Gibbs Racing, the future is looking up with changes being made. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Joe Gibbs Racing had a tough season in 2024. All of their drivers failed to make it to the Championship 4, and they went 18 races without a win. Ty Gibbs‘ grandfather had his own input on the recent changes at JGR. Ty Gibbs’ former chief, Chris Gayle, led JGR’s Xfinity team to 10 wins in 2021. As a result of moving Chris Gabehart to a new role and adding Gayle to the No. 11 team, JGR will be stronger for next season, according to team owner Joe Gibbs. Gibbs also said, “While we are still in the process of finalizing the new crew chief for the 54 team, we believe all these moves ultimately make our team stronger as we prepare for 2025.” Gibbs won the Xfinity championship in 2022 with Gayle as his crew chief, and they moved to the Cup Series in 2023. In their first playoff appearance this year, the team reached the Round of 16 but was eliminated. JGR’s competitive standing could be reshaped by Gayle’s move to Hamlin’s team as part of a broader shake-up. It is hoped that this change will rejuvenate the team and address the issues that prevented them from finding the victory lane in the latter part of 2024.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Ty Gibbs has been open about his own progress, but he has also been optimistic about JGR’s changes. As he steps into a new chapter of his career, he remains confident. And as the 2025 season approaches, all eyes will be on JGR. Like his grandfather’s football dynasty, Ty Gibbs believes success can come even after transition and reinvention. Despite its abruptness, the shake-up at Joe Gibbs Racing may make one of NASCAR’s most storied organizations more competitive.  Let the world know your perspective.

NASCAR perhaps is one of the most misunderstood sports of all time. For the most part, people believe that NASCAR drivers either have to be rich or backed by a racing family to make it into the premier division of stock car racing. Basically, from an established American household or a family. While this might be true for the drivers who do end up finding a spot on the field on the weekends, this notion isn’t entirely true. Here’s a look at prominent NASCAR stars who have had a successful career despite sharing non-American cultural roots. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Hendrick Motorsports star Kyle Larson is arguably the face of NASCAR racing in the modern era. While he has yet to reach the heights of legendary drivers like Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon, or Jimmie Johnson, he certainly is on the right path. Having bagged a Cup Series title and notched up race wins for fun, Larson is one of those gems who seems to be cut out, especially for racing. But did you know, apart from being the poster boy for NASCAR, the Elk Grove native also happens to be Japanese American? Now do not bombard his social media feed with questions in Japanese, as he can’t speak a word of it. Larson’s Japanese roots can be traced to his mother, Janet. During World War II, her parents spent time in a Japanese internment camp. Although the driver doesn’t speak about it much, he certainly has helped diversify the sport since his arrival. “I do feel like I’m making some sort of an impact. I’ve noticed more Aisnas at the racetracks these days than when I started.” Unlike the majority of NASCAR drivers in the modern era, Kyle Larson came from a working household, and his racecraft, skill, and dedication towards his craft have helped him garner all the love and support he enjoys today. via Imago NORTH WILKESBORO, NC – MAY 21: Kyle Larson 5 Hendrick Motorsports HendrickCars.com Chevrolet celebrates after winning the NASCAR, Motorsport, USA Cup Series All-Star Race on May 21, 2023 at North Wilkesboro Speedway in North Wilkesboro, NC.

Debate Next in line, we have our very own amigo of NASCAR, Daniel Suarez. He is the first Mexican-born driver to win a NASCAR National Series championship. While NASCAR fans have taken their time to completely welcome him to the sport, he is now a household name. Breaking on the Cup Series stage, he doesn’t shy away from his Mexican roots as he smashes a taco piñata after his race wins. He has driven his way up to the Cup Series level and is now a seasoned driver representing Trackhouse Racing in the No. 99 car. “I sincerely feel very proud and happy to be in this position, representing Latin America in the great sport of NASCAR. It’s a great honor to be a Mexican in the top category of NASCAR. It has been a long journey, but I am very happy and proud to be in this position.” Suarez said this while speaking to Hola. It has to be noted that Suarez was confirmed as a U.S. citizen this year. So now, he’s not only Amigo but also a Cowboy, and that certainly has a nice ring to it.

Mandatory Credit: Mike Dinovo-USA TODAY Sports Brad Keselowski is one of the most respected NASCAR drivers in the Cup garage. He is one of the rare breed of drivers who not only excelled as a racer but also as a team owner. While a lot has changed in the sport, Keselowski has always stuck by Ford and has been loyal to their race program. As it turns out, it’s something that runs with his family, and it started when his grandfather migrated to the United States in the hopes of finding a job at a Ford factory. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The veteran driver took a stroll down memory lane while speaking with Stapleton42 and revealed his family’s background. “My family, obviously a Polish descent family, immigrated and came here to work for Henry Ford. That’s how they got to the Detroit area, and Rochester Hills is a suburb of Detroit. World War II broke out, some different things happened, and they actually moved up here to the suburbs because my grandfather was a drill bit maker.” Now, Brad’s father was a racer, which saw him gravitate towards the love for race cars. A young Brad Keselowski would often spend time helping his father at the garage. Moreover, being exposed to NASCAR racing further sparked his desire to follow in his father’s footsteps. He even vividly remembers watching the 1992 championship race. “We had one chair, a couch, and a little bit of floor space. My spot was on the floor, right in front of the TV. I remember watching the ’92 championship race right there on that floor.” via Imago Image Credits: Imago It is fair to say that Brad Keselowski exceeded expectations throughout his racing career.

When Martin Truex Jr. announced he was stepping away from full-time NASCAR racing at the end of 2024, most fans assumed he’d swap race tracks for fishing spots and hunting trails. After all, the 2017 Cup Series champion seemed ready to trade high-speed turns for a slower-paced life filled with hobbies and relaxation. But it turns out Truex isn’t quite ready to let go of the driver’s seat—at least not entirely. One race has always eluded him: the Daytona 500. Even with a Cup championship and countless wins to his name, Truex has never claimed the sport’s most iconic trophy. With MTJ receiving an open offer from 23XI Racing for the Daytona 500, most fans expected the NASCAR veteran to take up the team’s Camry. Sounds like a plan, right? Not so fast. Truex just threw a curveball into those expectations—and it’s a big one. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Back in June, when Martin Truex Jr. announced his retirement plans, the  NASCAR world watched in shock. One of their favorite drivers would no longer continue to entertain them. However, Martin Truex Jr. gave them a sense of hope with an additional detail. He’d be looking to return just for the Daytona 500. It’s not strange for NASCAR drivers to return for specific races, and for MTJ, it was the track he never won at. At the time, his teammate Denny Hamlin immediately chimed in, offering Truex Jr a seat for the race if he ever wanted to participate. Hamlin was all-in on the idea, saying, “Any time that Martin gets bored and wants to run Cup, we would have a seat for him for sure.” Denny Hamlin has made similar offers to other drivers as well in the past. During one episode of his Actions Detrimental podcast, he even offered up the seat to NASCAR legend Carl Edwards, who later turned it down. With Denny Hamlin‘s energy about Martin Truex Jr. potentially driving for the team, things looked set to make the duo come together in 2025. In a surprising turn, Truex revealed that his 2025 Daytona 500 appearance won’t be with 23XI Racing after all. Instead, he’s sticking with familiar territory: Joe Gibbs Racing (JGR), the team where he spent the last stretch of his full-time career. So, what happened to the 23XI plan? Truex casually addressed it in a recent interview, saying, “Uh, no, it’s not [with 23XI]. Yeah, I’m not sure what they’re doing, honestly. It’s still up in the air. JGR’s doing it somehow. So we’ll see.” .@MartinTruex_Jr confirms that his upcoming Daytona 500 ride will not be with 23XI Racing. “I was told JGR’s doing it somehow, so we’ll see…”#NASCAR pic.twitter.com/KGlsbufPu9 — Peter Stratta (@peterstratta) November 22, 2024 Expand Tweet Truex sticking with JGR for Daytona 500—smart move or missed opportunity with 23XI Racing? Debate  While the exact reasoning behind the switch is unclear, the move feels right for Truex. At the moment, 23XI’s biggest priority will be to find themselves on stable ground in their ongoing lawsuit. NASCAR recently changed the wording of regulations that allowed 23XI Racing and FRM to run as open teams for 2025. However, the big problem for 23XI is the approval of Tony Stewart’s charter sale. Without it, they won’t be able to field Riley Herbst in the #35 car. Perhaps, fans will have some clarity on what happens to the MTJ-Hamlin collaboration when the dust of the lawsuit against NASCAR settles. He’s had an impressive run with Joe Gibbs Racing, winning races, competing for championships, and solidifying himself as a key figure in the team’s history. Reflecting on his time with JGR, Truex couldn’t say enough good things about the organization. “It was great, honestly. Just to be part of such a professional race team with so many smart people working hard to be the best,” he said. “Joe [Gibbs] has a high demand for performance, and he gets the best out of everyone. It’s a fun environment to race in.” With JGR by his side, Truex’s Daytona 500 attempt feels less like a nostalgic one-off and more like a calculated effort to chase that one big win still missing from his trophy case. But Daytona isn’t the only thing on his to-do list. Truex isn’t just dipping his toes back into the Cup Series—he’s also gearing up for some part-time racing in the Xfinity Series, where his NASCAR journey began. And for Martin Truex Jr., this isn’t about proving anything; it’s about having fun with a style of racing he genuinely enjoys. “I’m going to do the Daytona 500, and then I’m looking forward to racing some Xfinity cars just to have fun and see how it goes. I really enjoy that style of car—the low downforce. It’s like the older cars we used to race,” he shared. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Unlike the grueling demands of a full-time Cup Series schedule, Xfinity offers Truex the chance to enjoy the sport on his terms. This is a big factor, considering Martin Truex Jr. made the retirement decision because of NASCAR’s grueling schedule and not being able to spend enough time with his loved ones. He hasn’t picked specific tracks yet—“I don’t even know where they’re going,” he admitted with a laugh—but he’s excited about the possibilities. Beyond racing, Truex is ready to dive into hobbies he’s had to put on hold during his full-time career. “I’ve got a lot of hobbies, and I need to catch up on those. I’m excited about that,” he said. Whether it’s fishing, hunting, or just enjoying some well-earned downtime, Truex seems determined to strike a balance between life on the track and life off it. Fishing in particular strikes a chord for MTJ. During his childhood, Martin Truex Jr. grew up on the shores of New Jersey fishing. His father, Martin Truex Sr., a Busch North Series racer, owned a fishing company named Sea Watch International. It was only natural for Truex Jr. to develop fishing as one of his relaxing habits away from the high-stakes world of NASCAR. In fact, he once shared his biggest catch ever in 2019. It was a 570 lb bluefin tuna. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Fans certainly hope Martin Truex Jr. gets plenty of rest before the 2025 season gets underway. Who knows, after the Daytona 500, he may just have enough spark left to enter another race!  Let the world know your perspective.

Not many days have gone since the frenzied ‘Fire Billy Napier’ cry has settled down a bit. The Florida Gators’ coach started the regular college football season on a pretty lackluster note, garnering a lot of flakes from the outside. As a 20-33 loss to Texas A&M hit the breaking point in Week 3, netizens made a petition to replace him right then. But somehow, the Gators’ coach survived the backlash but couldn’t get better. The stacks kept on getting worse as the weeks passed. They are out of the playoff conversation after facing three consecutive losses. As they are now gearing up for the Week 13 clash against the Rebels, a win can do much more than just silence the anti-Napier campaign in Gainesville. Florida and Ole Miss players will butt heads on the Swamp this weekend, for the Rebels want to secure their trip to Atlanta, and the Gators look to play a spoiler on their big fat hope. But the real rivalry will pan out between the coaches. Lane Kiffin, 49, has widely been rumored as an ideal Gators’ fit if and when they replace Napier. If Gators can hand a clean defeat to Kiffin’s Ole Miss, it would be quite an answer to those who compared and vouched for Kiffin’s Florida connection. Gary Condron our biggest booster open to Kiffin as UF head coach 👀 hopefully the bull gators get on board and force the admin’s hand here that would be great. Some won’t like that hire but he’s what UF needs. Hire elite recruiters around him and we can be elite. pic.twitter.com/MIe0bJg1VY — Flagship of Florida 🏴‍☠️😎 (@whynotflorida) September 1, 2024 Expand Tweet ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad ”The chaos scenario is that Florida gets to take down the coach who everyone wants to replace Billy Napier. I mean, it wasn’t that long ago that Florida fans were totally out on the Billy Napier era, and they just had little heart eyes looking at Lane Kiffin, but then they would leave the swamp. If Florida is able to pull off this upset victory, they will leave the swamp with immaculate vibes because you think you’ve got the right coach, you think you’ve got the right quarterback and you were just able to show to that head coach over there at Ole Miss that being at Ole Miss ain’t like being in Florida,” said CBS Sports Chip Patterson. There is a legitimate chance that Florida will get their flowers at the Swamp. Firstly, the win over LSU broke their long-standing losing spree and revitalized the entire team. Thanks to DJ Lagway’s heroic injury comeback. As an insider revealed, Lagway isn’t likely to let his hurt hamstring get in the way of his team’s good going anymore. The kid will play with an apparatus that will work as an extra muscle to allow him to move comfortably. Can Billy Napier silence critics by outsmarting Lane Kiffin, or is it too late for redemption? Debate Red zone for Lane Kiffin and Ole Miss! They must turn to some unique masterstroke to stop Lagway; otherwise, it’s going to be Lagway’s game and coach Napier’s very personal victory over Lane Kiffin. That said, on the flip side of the story, Kiffin doesn’t really look to come to Gainesville at all. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Lane Kiffin has been at the helm of Ole Miss football since 2020. Apart from the professional ties, he developed strong bonds with all the players out there. He knows how they function, what they need to flourish, and more. It’s more than being a head coach. Kiffin’s harmonious stewardship with the Rebels sits pretty well with the fans and veterans alike as well. His records have also been pretty decent so far. So, there is no single reason for the veteran coach to switch teams now. He sees all the vehement Florida coach narratives and doesn’t bother to pay heed. But in a passive stance, Kiffin plain sells his loyalty to the Rebels. After Ole Miss’s mid-season victory against Wake Forest, fans flocked to hype it up on X. As a part of his active fan-engagement practices, The Rebels’ coach shortlisted a few tweets to reply. In a reply to one tweet, Kiffin reminisced about a similar win by his late father, Monte Kiffin, on the same ground back in 1981. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The HC genuinely connects with his present job in more than one way. He recently expressed how he wanted a safety net for Ole Miss by not qualifying for the death trap at Atlanta if he could.

20240928_jhp_wm6_0014 Debate Is NIL money ruining college football, or is it just leveling the playing field? This entire month has been a wild ride for Buffs and Wolverine fans. And no, we are not talking about the 8-2 and 5-5 run. With the season almost reaching the “finale”, recruitments have been all over the place. Somewhere, every CFB fan knew this would happen. The 2025 class recruitment is almost over, so it makes sense that we will see some flips and some decommitts. However, there is a much bigger change unfolding behind the scenes. See, back in the Nick Saban era, recruitment used to be simple. The powerhouses got most of the good players because of the reputation they had. Now? Well, if you want the best of the best, you throw in that good NIL money and you have it all. And that is kind of the case with Julian Lewis and Bryce Underwood. Back on The Pat McAfee Show, Nick Saban pointed out something important. “Well, I’m not sure if the system is great for development of players, but you certainly cannot blame the players for choosing the school for both reasons that you just said,” Saban pointed out. At the core, pursuing players with this entire “pay for play” model is not exactly sustainable. We all know what happened with the entire Jaden Rashada and Billy Napier lawsuit. So, there is always a potential risk. However, at the same time, Lewis and Underwood flipped for 2 specific reasons; Somewhere they can play but also garner a lot of wealth. And this mindset, in a nutshell, is modern recruitment for you.   ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Bryce Underwood and Julian Lewis GOT A BAG to flip their commitments to their new schools. 👀 pic.twitter.com/eKOo3e1xUg — Bookit Sports (@BookitHQ) November 22, 2024 Expand Tweet  For Lewis, while no NIL amount has been disclosed yet, we all know very well that playing for Deion Sanders comes with the added advantage of media fame, which in turn allows you to harness the brands and use them to build your future. And for Underwood? We all know that Michigan has offered around $10.5 million NIL for the flip. Even when Underwood flexed on the people with that custom $15k LSU chain, somewhere the huge NIL amount managed to tip the scales and land the Wolverines on the top QB of the 2025 class. Now, is this a bad thing? “It is certainly the best model for these guys to take advantage of right now because it is the ruse,” Saban points out. This does help Juju and Underwood secure a future which they problem won’t be able to do without the NIL money or the fame, and it is completely alright. But will this be good for their NFL career? “Maybe not the best model for that,” Saban noted. Regardless, you cannot deny that this change in the landscape brought us some amazing moments this season itself. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Is NIL money ruining college football, or is it just leveling the playing field? Debate The first big example is the Buckeyes. Ryan Day and OSU have put upwards of $20 million into building a noteworthy roster. And has it paid off? The Buckeyes are currently sitting on the No.2 spot on the playoff list. So in short, yes, it has. They have the talent they need to win against big powerhouses, and that is the most important part. Another example is Ole Miss. Last season, the Rebels lost to the Bulldogs at a blowout 52-17. Lane Kiffin had nothing to stop Kirby Smart and his offense. Fast forward to the 2024 season and the Dawgs went home with a disappointing 10-28 loss to the Rebels.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The NIL factor allowed Kiffin to reach into the portal and build a defense and offense around his QB Jaxson Dart and this got him the result he wanted. They got their revenge and Ole Miss is well on its way to the playoffs. This NIL thing has the power to make any program good. You just have to know how to use it correctly.

Every year, NASCAR teams and drivers gather to celebrate the season at the NASCAR Awards Banquet. It was at the 2011 banquet that Tony Stewart and Jimmie Johnson pulled off an unforgettable prank. The audience was stunned and buzzing for days after what began as a traditional awards show turned into hilarity. There was nothing ordinary about this year for NASCAR. Stewart just won the Sprint Cup Series championship after narrowly beating Carl Edwards in a tiebreaker. It was hard for Johnson to deal with falling short after dominating for five seasons. There was excitement surrounding Stewart’s victory as well as optimism surrounding Johnson’s drive for reinvention. With a single announcement from the host, the banquet took a turn for the weird. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad An otherwise formal evening was lightheartedly broken up by NASCAR’s camaraderie. The duo delivered a moment that reminded everyone in attendance of the joy and unpredictability NASCAR brings on and off the track. For Johnson, there was a layer of poignancy behind the laughter. After the 2011 season, he ended a record-breaking championship streak that made him a living legend. Instead of focusing on Stewart’s win, it focused on the bonds between competitors. The atmosphere was competitive but respectful, with a hint of humor thrown in. Jimmie Johnson came on stage as a living legend. He already had four consecutive years of winning the Cup Series Championship. However, while Tony Stewart won the trophy in 2011, Johnson showed up at the awards ceremony to support his friend and rival Stewart. The audience sat in eager anticipation as the host announced the head table honoree. “And the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion driver of the number 14 Office Depot, Mobil 1 Chevrolet of Stewart-Haas Racing, Tony Stewart…” A momentary pause followed, then the announcement repeated itself, each time more jumbled, with phrases like “Stewart-Horse Racing” thrown in for good measure. The crowd went a bit crazy until Tony Stewart showed up, grinning mischievously, to Jimmie Johnson‘s question. The driver needed no clarification on what just happened. He realized Tony Stewark had just pranked him. via Getty SOUTH BOSTON, VIRGINIA – JUNE 25: Tony Stewart #14 climbs into his car prior to the Camping World Superstar Racing Experience event at South Boston Speedway on June 25, 2022 in South Boston, Virginia. (Photo by Jared Tilton/SRX/Getty Images) He celebrated his championship with his characteristic flair but Johnson used his speech to showcase his competitive drive and outlook. Looking back on his five championships, Johnson expressed gratitude for the journey but also regretted 2011. “There’s an indescribable feeling of accomplishment that comes with being the champion,” he admitted, adding that it was tough not to experience it that year. Did Tony Stewart's prank on Jimmie Johnson steal the spotlight from his own championship win? Debate The moment was simply a reminder of the bond the two share. When Tony Stewart chose to call it quits at the end of the 2016 season, Johnson had a heartwarming message for his friend, asking him not to grow up. In an even more heartwarming moment, after Jimmie Johnson won the Championship race at Homestead-Miami and sealed his seventh title, he had a special gift for his friend. The two swapped their helmets as a reminder of all the memories they shared, and all the races they fought each other in. For now, it’s time to see how Johnson took the 2011 defeat with grace. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Even though it was disappointing, Johnson maintained a positive tone, stressing that he was committed to rebuilding. Despite their dominance, he acknowledged that they had grown complacent because of their dominance. The competition had studied and adapted to strategies that once set the No. 48 team apart, forcing Johnson and his crew to face the reality of being caught. It was humbling, but it motivated them to keep pushing forward. In his speech, Johnson praised Stewart’s achievement, calling it “the impossible” and congratulating his rival-turned-friend. He also talked about his future ambitions. He thanked Hendrick Motorsports and his sponsors, but it was clear he was focused on getting back on top. “I won’t be able to feel [the accomplishment of a championship] this year,” Johnson admitted, “but I’m really proud of the guy who will.” Taking his loss in with grace, Jimmie Johnson went into the following seasons with a sense of greater energy to win the title once again. While 2012 didn’t go his way either, with the driver finishing 3rd in the Championship. He did manage to win the titles in 2013 and 2016, but the streak of winning back-to-back championships remains unbroken. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad It was also a nice chance for Johnson to reflect on his personal growth. The driver joked about his reluctant foray into social media and even poked fun at his on-track run-ins, including his failed attempt to crash Kurt Busch. It was clear, despite his humor, that the setbacks of 2011 would provide fuel for a comeback. Pranks like this one are fan-favorites in NASCAR lore, emblematic of the personalities that make it so fun. Aside from the laughs, the banquet captured a pivotal moment in both drivers’ careers. After a rare defeat, Stewart celebrated a hard-fought championship and Johnson was preparing to rewrite his story.  Let the world know your perspective.

(Photo by Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images) Debate Can Elvis Smylie maintain his lead and claim victory, or will Jason Day steal the spotlight? The 2024 BMW Australian PGA Championship began on November 21 and will go on till November 24 at the Royal Queensland Golf Club in Brisbane. This event, which has now been cut short to 54 holes because of 180mm rainfall on Thursday night also serves as one of the most significant golf tournaments in Australia. The championship features a mix of Australia’s top players and international stars. Min Woo Lee returned to the field to defend his title, while players like Cameron Smith have made the event all the more thrilling. The first round has already concluded, and Elvis Smylie has taken the lead by one stroke, and three players are tied for the second position. If Smylie continues with the same momentum, he might grab the trophy this year. The 2024 BMW Australian PGA Championship has a total purse of AUD 2 million which is around USD 1.3 million. If Elvis Smylie keeps up with the pace of his gameplay, he will be taking home the highest portion of the total prize money. He will be getting $340,000. On the other hand, players finishing in the runner-up and second runner-up positions will be entitled to AUD 220,000 and AUD126,000. All the seventy players who make the cut after the Friday round will get some portion of the prize money. The player who finishes at the bottom of the leaderboard will get the lowest amount (AUD3,800). Here is what the final payout in Australian Dollars looks like: The winner will also get approximately 13.1 OWGR points, and 2000 Race to Dubai points are on the line too. While the field is filled with star-studded players, Jason Day is one of the highest-ranked players. And well, while he needs to maintain his rank, the 2024 BMW Australian PGA Championship is a rather special event for him nonetheless. Jason Day teed off with Cameron Smith and Min Woo Lee during the opening round from the back nine. He is currently tied at T6 with five other players and is just two strokes behind Elvis Smylie. He is all set to make his home fans proud since this is the first time he has been playing on Australian soil since the 2017 Australian Open. This year also marks Jason Day’s return to the Australian PGA Championship after a 12-year hiatus since his T9 finish at Coolum in 2011. Now 37, Day has been reacquainting himself with the significantly updated Royal Queensland Golf Club layout.     A post shared by Jason Day (@jasondayofficial)  As the highest-ranked player in the field at No. 31 in the Official World Golf Ranking, Day recognizes he might not be the crowd favorite in Queensland. He humbly acknowledged the local hero, saying, “Cammy [Smith] is a very big favorite here and has a lot of fans,” referring to three-time Australian PGA Championship winner Cameron Smith. He also added that although he is from Australia he does not play much there and hence it is difficult to get fans attention. But he is willing to fight through it. Do you think Day will be able to lift the trophy on his home ground when the 54-hole play comes to an end on Sunday? Let us know in the comments section below!   Let the world know your perspective.

This is that time of the college football season when Heisman races get more interesting. Surprisingly, this year, the top two contenders are not the quarterbacks. Any guesses? You are right if Deion Sander’s two-way star and Ashton Jeanty popped into your head. Indeed, Hunter is deserving of the honor. His dual-threat sets him apart. Ashton Jeanty, who was leading the race for the past few weeks, is in the second position after Week 12. Now, the competition is getting more fierce as we get closer to the champions. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad     A post shared by College Football (@cfbalerts) Let’s get into it. Cumulative snaps? Is there any chance that he may be talking about Coach Prime’s No. 12? Just kidding! Of course, he’s undermining Hunter’s game. Talking about the snaps, Hunterh has played around 1200 of those ‘not-that-great-as-per-some-people’ things for the Buffs this season. But is that it? Is that why Hunter advocates keep going gaga over him? Absolutely not. He’s a Heisman contender because he makes Heisman plays. So far, he has caught 74 receptions for 911 yards and scored nine touchdowns. On the other hand, he has recorded 23 tackles. Let’s not even get into the interceptions. He had one against the Utah Utes in Week 12. Offensively, he miraculously caught a 4th down pass attempt by jumping over two Utah defenders. That’s what he brings to every snap. On the other hand, Jeanty has appeared in 10 games, completed 1893 rushing yards, which is the highest this season, and scored 26 touchdowns. This season, he also holds the record for most rushing yards and rushing touchdowns in a single season, a record set by the Oklahoma State Cowboys and Detroit Lions running back Barry Sanders. Sanders completed 2,628 yards and scored 37 touchdowns in 1988. Clearly, Jeanty is on his way towards historic numbers. Both can make the case to be the Heisman and of course, the whole thing is subjective. So, there will be opinions and counter-opinions. But let’s not undermine one to advocate for the other. Moving ahead, let’s see who is after Hunter and Jeanty in the race. If Hunter makes any mistake this week, Jeanty has a chance to lead again. But the competition is not just between both of them. Cam Ward, Alabama’s quarterback Jalen Milroe and Indiana’s QB Kurtis Rourke are also on the list. After Miama’s recent defeat against Georgia Tech, Ward’s odds have dropped significantly. It is not a good sign, but he is still a strong quarterback. As we know, the dynamics change every single week; again, no doubt, he has improved a lot and remains one of the best quarterbacks in the country. If he delivers against Wake Forest and Syracuse, he has a high chance of being in the top spot. Oh, is Jalen Milroe a contender? He had a rollercoaster ride this season, but he is back on track. After disappointing a few weeks in the second half, he delivered one of his best performances last week. We are sure he has learned lots of lessons this season as he led the program to an impressive 8-2 record. Meanwhile, another addition could be Indiana’s Kurtis Rourke, who is currently making headlines; he will improve his position if he helps Indiana set a new 11-0 record. Will he? Who do you think deserves the title? Is Hunter's dual-threat ability enough to overshadow Jeanty's record-breaking rushing stats for the Heisman?

   Three teams made the postseason out of the American League Central this season, but unfortunately for the Chicago White Sox, they were not one of them. Not only did the White Sox miss the playoffs, but they had one of the worst seasons in MLB history as they finished with a record of 41 wins and 121 losses. The White Sox will have some work to do if they want to put together a competitive roster for the 2025 season. With this offseason being an important one for the White Sox, they have made a contract decision about Gavin Sheets. According to Jon Heyman on ‘X,’ Sheets was non-tendered by the White Sox. Gavin Sheets non-tendered by White Sox — Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) November 22, 2024  A basic non-tendered definition is when an organization chooses to not give a player a contract for the upcoming season, therefore making them a free agent. Sheets came into the league with the White Sox in 2021 and has played all four MLB seasons for the organization. In 2024, Sheets played in 139 games and batted .233 with 10 home runs, 45 RBIs, and a .660 OPS. The White Sox struggled in general as a team, but Sheets had a career-high in hits, runs scored, doubles, and triples. It will be interesting to see how the White Sox approach building their roster for next season and whether or not they completely wipe the roster and opt for a full reset. The White Sox won the AL Central just four years ago in 2021, but they have dramatically fallen off ever since. Will Venable, the White Sox’s new manager, will have his work cut out for him if he wants to get this White Sox team back to a competitive level in 2025."

   The Kansas City Royals were one of three teams out of the American League Central to make the postseason in 2024. After missing the postseason for the last eight seasons after winning the World Series in 2015, the Royals broke through in 2024. A key player in the Royals’ 86-win season and playoff berth was their star shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. MLB Network’s Analyst Tom Verducci made a big statement about Witt Jr’s 2024 season. “This is one of the all-time great seasons by a shortstop,” Verducci said. ""This is one of the all-time great seasons by a shortstop."" Bobby Witt Jr. put up historic numbers for the @Royals in 2024 and it landed him on the AL MVP podium! 👏 pic.twitter.com/q5Lpq7rvXv — MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) November 22, 2024  Witt Jr. came into the league with the Royals in 2022 and has improved each season with the team. In 2024, Witt Jr. played in 161 games and batted .332 with 32 home runs, 109 RBIs, 31 stolen bases, and a .977 OPS. Verducci pointed out that Witt Jr. won the batting title while having a 30/30 season with 30 plus home runs and 30 plus stolen bases, and he was only the third player to ever do so. The Royals lost 106 games in 2023, but they were able to turn it around in 2024 and finish with a record of 86 wins and 76 losses. Witt Jr. had a career-high in games played, runs scored, hits, doubles, home runs, RBIs, walks, batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and OPS in 2024. If Witt Jr. can continue to improve his game each season, he could regularly see his name in the Most Valuable Player conversation. The Royals will look to put together another winning season in 2025 as they look to make the playoffs two years in a row for the first time since 2014 and 2015."

   The Milwaukee Brewers made the postseason for the second straight year as they finished with a record of 93 wins and 69 losses. Although they made the playoffs and won the National League Central for the second straight season, the Brewers made an early exit as they lost to the New York Mets in the wild-card round. The Brewers lost their former Most Valuable Player Christian Yelich to injury during the season, but their star rookie outfielder Jackson Chourio was able to step up in his place. Brewers Manager Pat Murphy revealed his thoughts on Jackson Chourio this season. “I’ve never seen that type of growth in the major leagues.  At the end of the year, you didn’t want anyone else at the plate,” Murphy said. ""I've never seen that type of growth in the major leagues.""

His impressive rookie season was enough to finish third in the National League Rookie of the Year voting. Chourio played in 148 games and batted .275 with 21 home runs, 79 RBIs, and a .791 OPS. Murphy describes that he’s never seen a player struggle at the beginning of the season and have that much growth by the end of the same season. Chourio went from a miserable slump to seemingly coming through for his team in every at-bat he took. Although the Brewers lost Yelich, Chourio was able to step up and be the guy, and the Brewers hope he can continue his success in his sophomore season."

   The Detroit Tigers were one of Major League Baseball’s most surprising teams in 2024 as they made the playoffs for the first time in the last ten seasons. Not only did they make the playoffs, but they swept the Houston Astros in the wild-card series before losing to the Cleveland Guardians in the American League Division Series in five games. The MLB offseason is heating up as free agent players began talking with teams interested in signing them. Alex Bregman is one of the big-name free agents this offseason and MLB Analyst Scott Braun predicted where he thinks Bregman will end up. “Bregman to third for the Tigers,” Braun said. .@scottbraun says Alex Bregman will end up in Motown with the @Tigers pic.twitter.com/QTbf0SdkYb — Foul Territory (@FoulTerritoryTV) November 22, 2024  Bregman came into the league in 2016 with the Astros and has played all nine seasons of his MLB career with the organization. In 2024, Bregman batted .260 with 26 home runs, 75 RBIs, and a .768 OPS in 145 games played. Braun thinks that Bregman would be a great fit for the Tigers and be the player they thought Javier Baez would be when they signed him. Bregman is one of those players who makes every player around him better, and Braun thinks his veteran presence would fit perfectly in this young Tigers team’s clubhouse. Nothing is ever set in stone during free agency, but predictions can make it fun for fans to hope their team will sign a superstar player. Bregman will draw interest from several teams, but Braun thinks the Tigers are where he will end up. The Tigers will look to make the postseason for the second straight season as they search for their fifth World Series title in franchise history."

   The ending of the Major League Baseball season saw the New York Yankees fall to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series. After losing a chance at another title, the Yankees have another battle on their hands as they try to resign their star outfielder Juan Soto. Along with the Yankees, Soto is also drawing interest from the New York Mets. MLB Analyst Deesha Thosar was asked who is feeling the most pressure to sign Soto. “I think Hal is feeling the pressure, and I think the Yankees need it more,” Thosar said. Hal Steinbrenner is ""feeling the pressure"" says @DeeshaThosar pic.twitter.com/Hpny9Xnrcb — Foul Territory (@FoulTerritoryTV) November 22, 2024  Thosar explains that Cohen, the owner of the Mets, has flexed his ability to sign big players multiple times with the signings of Justin Verlander, Max Scherzer, and Francisco Lindor. She also mentions that Steinbrenner, the owner of the Yankees, hasn’t been this publicly vocal about a free agent signing since Aaron Judge was a free agent. Soto is also drawing interest from teams outside of New York including the Los Angeles Dodgers, Boston Red Sox, and Toronto Blue Jays, so the competition is heating up. The Yankees went to the World Series in Soto’s first year with the team, which could play in their favor when he makes his final decision. If Soto is just looking for the highest number, then it would appear Cohen has the advantage. It will be interesting to see how the Soto sweepstakes plays out in the end."

   The Buffalo Bills look like they could be the team of destiny right now. Sean McDermott’s team is sitting at a record of 9-2 and is coming off a huge win at home over the previously unbeaten Kansas City Chiefs. Former NFL quarterback and current NBC analyst Chris Simms joined the Dan Le Batard Show Friday afternoon to talk about the Bills being the biggest threat to the Chiefs in the AFC. “The Bills are real this year. This is the most real team that they’ve had in awhile. If they play the Chiefs in the playoffs – they’re going to beat the Chiefs in the playoffs,” Simms bluntly said. ""The Bills are real this year. This is the most real team that they've had in awhile.

WATCH: https://t.co/7ZAwqQ9fFk pic.twitter.com/J5V7bmVMG7 — Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz (@LeBatardShow) November 22, 2024  The Bills and Chiefs might have the biggest rivalry in the sport right now among rivalries out of the division. While Kansas City has handled business in the playoffs against Buffalo in previous years, this season feels a little different. Bills Pro Bowl quarterback Josh Allen is playing like an MVP as he has continued to utilize his multitude of weapons on offense. Running back James Cook might be the most underrated running back in the game, and the addition of wide receiver Amari Cooper has made a huge difference too. Defensively, this unit has been able to perform well after cutting ties with plenty of veterans from years past last offseason. After seeing Buffalo handle Kansas City by two possessions last Sunday, that could make for an even spicier rematch if the teams were to meet down the road in late January."

   The Major League Baseball awards have now been completed after the winners of the National and American League Most Valuable Players were announced on Thursday. Chris Sale of the Atlanta Braves took home the NL Cy Young Award while Tarik Skubal won the AL Cy Young Award. According to MLB Network Radio on Sirius XM on ‘X,’ opposing batters hit just .159 with zero home runs against Sale’s changeup in 2024. Braves special assistant Tyler Flowers gave his thoughts on Sale’s changeup. “The re-introduction of Chris Sale’s changeup brings another element back into play,” Flowers said. Opposing batters hit just .159 with ZERO home runs against Chris Sale's changeup in 2024.#Braves | @Braves 🔗 https://t.co/fGPbvbjGlC pic.twitter.com/LNAvhDnrIB — MLB Network Radio on SiriusXM (@MLBNetworkRadio) November 22, 2024  Flowers not only mentions how dominating Sale’s changeup was this season, but he also believes that it helped him with his durability issues. When Sale was playing for the Boston Red Sox, he was using his slider a lot more often, which Flowers thinks contributed to his injury issues. 2024 was Sale’s first season with the Braves and he started 29 games with a record of 18 wins and three losses with a 2.38 ERA and 225 strikeouts in 177.2 innings pitched. Sale had a career-high in wins and his most strikeouts since the 2017 season when he had 308 with the Red Sox. After winning his first Cy Young Award of his career, it will be interesting to see how Sale performs next season if he indeed does play another year. The Braves will hope to see their newly acquired ace starting pitcher back on the mound next season."

   As the Major League Baseball offseason gets underway and the free agent class takes over most of the attention, other big headlines should be noted. There have been rumors of robot umpires circling the league for a while now, but 2025 will actually see robot umpires used during spring training games. The addition of robot umpires would ensure that the calls on the field are correct and avoid the multiple missed or wrong calls that happen on a daily basis with human umpires. MLB Analyst Erik Kratz gave his thoughts on the MLB testing robot umpires in 2025 spring training and possibly implementing it league-wide as early as 2026. MLB will test robot umpires in Spring Training and could implement it league-wide as early as 2026.@ErikKratz31 offers his thoughts… 👇 pic.twitter.com/b7GTcbisy2 — Foul Territory (@FoulTerritoryTV) November 22, 2024  Kratz mentions that some umpires are all for the robot umpires, and some don’t really care either way. The MLB has made several changes to the game in recent years including the addition of the pitch clock, making the bases larger, and limiting the number of mound visits a team may use. With the addition of robot umpires, the game would likely move along quicker as there would be no reason to argue any of the calls on the field. It will be interesting to see how the test run goes during spring training and to see if we could see robot umpires in the 2026 regular season. The free agent class is getting most of the attention this offseason, but the robot umpires will be another topic that will be talked about more as time goes on. Robot umpires could be another tactic used by the MLB to speed up the game times in a season that includes 162 regular season games."

   New Orleans Pelicans forward Zion Williamson has played in just six games due to injury this season. As he is working his way back to the court, he has also had so time to get another tattoo. In a recent video that has surfaced on social media, Williamson received a tattoo on his back of an animated character (via NBA Central). Zion’s new back tattoo 👀 (🎥 @Antmikes / @overtime )   pic.twitter.com/gJIsT10O6n — NBACentral (@TheDunkCentral) November 22, 2024  The two-time All-Star has struggled to stay healthy during his young career. In parts of six years, the former Duke Blue Devil has played in over 60 games just twice. He missed the entire 2021-2022 season due to injury. This is not what the Pelicans were expecting when he was drafted in the first round back in the 2019 NBA Draft. While the team has had Williamson on the roster, they have not made it past the first round of the playoffs and have finished no higher than eighth in the Western Conference standings. Luckily, the former National College Player of the Year is still just 24 years of age. He has plenty of time to get back to full health. Remember, Philadelphia 76ers MVP center Joel Embiid has had his fair share of injuries and has been able to become one of the faces of the league. A lot of eyes need to be on Williamson as he continues to scratch and claw towards recovery. As it stands right now, he is still the present and future of the team. Perhaps more time spent on the rehab process could do him and the franchise some good."

They are leading the NFC and the NFC North at 9-1 as head coach Dan Campbell has completely turned the ship around in the Motor City. Now, because of Mike Tomlin and the Pittsburgh Steelers losing on the road to the 3-8 Cleveland Browns on Thursday night, Campbell is the favorite to win Coach of the Year. According to ESPN BET, Campbell is the favorite to win the award at +275. After the Steelers loss last night, Dan Campbell is the new favorite to win Coach Of The Year 🏆 pic.twitter.com/OymHx3Lbb6 — ESPN BET (@ESPNBET) November 22, 2024  After what Campbell has done over the last couple of seasons, he might have a case for why he should have already won the award. But after making the NFC Championship Game last season, this Lions team looks to be even better. They look like a Super Bowl team, thanks to how they play week in and week out. Pro Bowl quarterback Jared Goff looks like an MVP as he continues to utilize All-Pro pass-catcher Amon-Ra St. Brown and Co. Additionally, the running back duo of David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs could be the best in the league. It helps when you have an elite offensive line. Defensively, defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn leads a gritty unit that has overcome the loss of star edge-rusher Aidan Hutchinson. This week, the Lions are set to travel to face the Indianapolis Colts in Indy this Sunday afternoon. Another big win and the Coach of the Year odds will undoubtedly continue to skyrocket for Dan Campbell."

It was a fascinating 45 minutes in his company in which, speaking both English and Portuguese, he addressed topics on his style, why he believes in these players, and whether he has spoken to his idol, and former Manchester United manager, Jose Mourinho. Amorim smiled a lot but also showed there is a steeliness to his character, too.   He is preparing to take charge of his first game in his new role on Sunday away to Ipswich Town where fans will watch with interest to see what he has managed to implement on these players in such a short space of time. As well as his briefing with reporters, he also sat down with former Manchester United defender Gary Neville for an extended chat for Sky Sports. Mail Sport picks out five things we learned from those two media appearances from the charismatic new man in charge…      Ruben Amorim addressed the British media for the first time as Manchester United boss      He was charismatic and insightful but also showed a steely side to him as a born winner Amorim has a signature smile, that’s the first thing to note. It is infectious to those who come into contact with him – but you would be wrong to assume his happy-go-lucky appearance at times paints him as a soft touch. Amorim is fiercely competitive and also incredibly clear in his demands. He said that having been a top-level player previously, he knows ‘all of the tricks’ and won’t be giving players too much leeway to play with him or his coaches when it comes to putting in the hard yards. ‘First thing, I think we have to be better athletes. That is something that you can acknowledge when we are here and we see the data,’ he told Neville in the Sky Sports chat. ‘When I say fitter, it’s not being thinner or anything about that. It’s the data. You have to understand the data to press high, what is the average metres that you have to run, the sprints. ‘You have all this data and you have to cope with that. So you already know your goal is to reach that. You can run a lot but if you don’t understand the game, it doesn’t matter. But the first point to press high, you have to be very fit and you have to cope with the demands of pressing high.’ So his non-negotiables, we learned what those are, too. ‘You can say the pretty things like hard work, be professional. You should be,’ he said. ‘This is Manchester United. In every club [you should be] but here, of course, you cannot run from that.      While he has a signature smile, there is also a ruthless drive that will rub off on his players   ‘The aim is to think first in the team. So I know that some guys will sometimes play in a different position, but they have to understand the position and they have to fight for the team. As a former player, I know every trick.’ It should be noted, though, that at 39 years old and not too far removed from the dressing room as a player himself, Amorim can connect with many of United’s stars like those who have come before him often couldn’t. He knows how they think, knows how they operate on good and bad days and there is also that unwavering loyalty to his players. ‘I can lose my job before throwing a player under the bus,’ he said. ‘But if he doesn’t put the team in first place, I will be the first one to talk with the player.’ To any of the players who were dialled in, consider the lines drawn in the sand. Now it’s over to you. Ever since Amorim got the job and it became clear he was going to go with 3-4-3 from the off, the identity of who will play in the wing-back roles has been the source of fierce debate. Wingers are synonymous with Manchester United but many of their attackers who play out wide have shown limited capabilities going the other way when asked to defend.      He will favour full-backs such as Noussair Mazraoui (left) to play in his wing-back positions      He is totally confident in his approach and philosophy but knows some players cannot do it    It made Amorim’s response to Neville when asked about it particularly interesting as an insight into his thinking after just a few days of training. He said he will ‘likely start with full backs in wing-back roles, because to teach a winger to defend is harder.’ It should be noted that in training footage released by United we saw Antony deployed as a right wing-back. But if we take Amorim at his word now, it means that Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Amad Diallo, Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund are all competing for just three places in the 3-4-3 line up, with Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui set to get the nods out wide. It was also particularly interesting in his press conference that Amorim has total belief in his system and any players who don’t feel the same will soon be cut loose. ‘As a coach you have to choose one way or another, I choose always 100 per cent our way,’ he said. ‘I choose to risk a bit. I believe so much in our way of playing; they will believe too. There is no second way. ‘We will adapt some players because we don’t have a different profile. Maybe on Sunday you will see the starting 11 and not feel a lot of change but you will see it in the game and the positioning or where they receive the ball.’ Garnacho the left wing-back? Think again.      It raises questions about where Alejandro Garnacho fits in with a system not suited to wingers ‘Call me naive,’ he said with a grin on his face, ‘but I truly believe that I’m the right guy in the right moment. ‘I could be wrong, but the earth still will turn, the sun will rise again. It doesn’t matter. I truly believe that I’m the right guy for this job.’ This wasn’t bluster. A man bluffing his way to a headline. Ruben Amorim has total belief that he is the man to finally take Manchester United back to the top. Now, they all say this during the honeymoon stage, you expect nothing less. And perhaps this is recency bias but observing Amorim it is hard not to be impressed – and ultimately believe him. It is important to note too that he is not scared to tread where perhaps other new managers dare not, particularly when it comes to calling out his superiors. ‘Us as a club have to set the standards and have to manage that,’ he told Neville when asked about Marcus Rashford and Casemiro jetting off to the United States during the international break. ‘It’s my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly. This is something that us as a club have to decide. ‘Would I set a different structure? Yes, for sure.’ Amorim transformed Sporting into the dominant force in Portuguese football and he didn’t take them there by worrying about who he may upset along the way. His career to date has built him up for the biggest challenge of them all, now it’s on him to show he can handle it and thrive, rather than shrink, in the spotlight.      Amorim thinks he can be first United boss to win the Premier League since Sir Alex Ferguson      Amorim appears intent on learning about the history of the club      He must now figure out how to get the best out of the current United squad Erik ten Hag used to talk about being ‘in the same boat’ with Ineos and the football board, particularly when it came to recruitment. We reported recently that funds will be significantly reduced for Amorim as a result of Ten Hag’s lavish spend of more than £600million – but we learned that any suggestion he won’t be consulted, or allowed a veto, on signings is flat out wrong. ‘I think it has to be all together because if you are a coach coming here and already chose the players, you could be wrong because the club will be here for a long time and you as a coach, you don’t know that,’ he said. ‘We have to improve the process of recruitment, the data. I think it is all together, but the final word should be the manager, not because it is your right but because it is your responsibility. ‘I have to understand the league and then when everything is aligned, everyone is on the same page, we can buy and sell players.’ Sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox have been key drivers in recruitment since arriving but consider this another line drawn in the sand by Amorim. It is he who will have the final say, that much is for sure.      Amorim (pictured far right) will have to work with Man United’s INEOS board on recruitment Footage from his early training sessions showed him getting his players rushing up and down the pitch to recover possession in the exercise of giving it away. They do that a lot in games, he conceded, and continuing to do that will see results falter as they have been. So, along with needing to be ‘better athletes’ you can bet your bottom dollar that Amorim and his coaching staff will be relentless when it comes to the fitness levels of this group between now and the end of the season. I hope the players packed their running shoes… Your email address will not be published.

Chelsea’s head coach says he has ‘no idea’ how Foxes fans will welcome him back to the King Power Stadium on Saturday, but insists his connection with the squad was special. Leicester secured their return to the elite level of English football via Leeds losing 4-0 at QPR on April 26. Maresca was at home celebrating when a tap on the window in the early hours of the morning led him to discover his stars waiting outside in his garden.   ‘I was at home watching the (QPR versus Leeds) game, then when it finished, all the staff arrived,’ Maresca said. ‘We were having a normal celebration, with family, kids, the staff, Willy (Caballero), Danny (Walker), Robby (Vitiello). ‘Then later – very late – the players arrived. The first face I saw was Hamza (Choudhury) but they didn’t even knock at the door – they were in the garden and then at my window. When I drew the curtains, it was his face there. ‘It was probably the best present I got last season. It showed how the team was close, and the connection with the players, that they could go for parties at different places yet they all arrived at my home. I will always be thankful to them. When I was a player I was lucky to win things but I never thought to go to the manager’s house.’      Enzo Maresca has detailed how Leicester players gatecrashed his house at 2am after they won the Championship      Maresca led the Foxes to the Championship title – and promotion back to the Premier League      Now he is in charge of Chelsea and will take his new side back to his former club on Saturday Asked how he thinks Leicester’s fans will welcome him back to the King Power, Maresca said: ‘I have no idea. But I know how I am going to be with them. I will be thankful to the club, the players and the fans. Because it was a fantastic season. I cannot control how they are going to receive me. But I can control how I receive them.’ Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall was among those who turned up unannounced at Chez Maresca. The 26-year-old midfielder followed his manager from Leicester to Chelsea for £30million, though has not yet started a Premier League match. ‘Kiernan was, at Leicester, the most important player,’ Maresca said. ‘He moved to Chelsea to be one other player. You have to accept that. ‘Probably at the beginning, you struggle to accept that. Now it’s getting better. Me as a manager, I am very happy with Kiernan, no doubt. But for sure for him, he has to continue to work, wait for the chance and take it, in the way he is doing in the Conference League. He is doing OK.’ Your email address will not be published.

Watkins has been one of the Premier League’s most lethal strikers during Emery’s tenure and was chosen ahead of Harry Kane for England’s Nations League win in Greece this month. At Villa, though, Watkins is facing his own challenge from Jhon Duran. Watkins has been substituted between the 60th and 70th minute six times this season, and Duran has eight goals in all competitions to Watkins’s five — although the Colombian has not scored in the Premier League since September 21.   ‘Each player has to understand the process we have,’ said Emery, whose side face Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon.  ‘Watkins is very important for us, but some circumstances can change. We are building a team with two players for every position. ‘Watkins has to accept and adapt quickly to his new position, playing the same way as last year, with his quality and capacity. I don’t want just one player feeling confident, getting minutes, scoring goals. I want every player to have the same mentality.’      Unai Emery has hinted that Ollie Watkins’ starting spot at No 9 for Aston Villa is not guaranteed       Jhon Duran has scored eight goals in all competitions for Villa – three more than Watkins Emery pointed out that without Duran’s contributions early in the season, Villa might be far worse off. Though they have lost their past two league matches, Villa remain firmly in Champions League contention. Duran was decisive in wins over West Ham, Leicester and Everton after coming on, as Watkins struggled to find top form having played at Euro 2024. Emery added: ‘Watkins needed time to get fit and confident again. He did not do all the pre-season. ‘We needed Duran scoring goals in the last 30 minutes of matches. ‘If we didn’t have Duran helping as we did, then maybe we wouldn’t have the points that we do now. The team, the squad, the commitment to help — these are the most important things.’ Your email address will not be published.

For them, it’s almost an annual event, so rare is it for them to lose one game of football, let alone four in a row. At Arsenal, we went through long periods without losing. You play in a very proud manner, with that feeling of being unbeatable energising and enveloping everyone.   Yet I would be lying if I said we did not wonder what would happen if and when that bubble were to burst. Arsene Wenger even used to ask me how I thought the team might respond once we were beaten. Pep Guardiola faced that very problem over the last month as City became the talk of the Premier League for all the wrong reasons. Who knows, maybe the noise around Guardiola possibly leaving amid their 115 charges was unsettling, but all that uncertainty vanished overnight with his signing of a new two-year contract. Now what they need is to follow that up with a home win over Tottenham.      Pedro Porro’s relentless crossing ability from right back may prove to be a handful for Man City      Pep Guardiola will look to snap his side’s four game losing streak at home on Saturday evening Looking at the brave way Ange Postecoglou’s team play, City will be asked questions on Saturday evening. What Tottenham will offer is more balls into the box than anyone they have faced. Nobody in the Premier League has produced a higher number of crosses than Spurs’ 275 this season, with Pedro Porro responsible for 76 of those as the full back flies down the right wing to allow Brennan Johnson to move inside. When you look back at the goals conceded by City this could pose a problem, as there are some serious issues which need solving. Take Fulham’s second goal at the Etihad last month, for example. The visitors are moving the ball from side to side at the back, but then one punched pass takes them through two lines of City’s defensive shield and into a pocket of space behind their Rodri-less midfield. Fulham work it wide to Reiss Nelson on the right with zero pressure on them. The cross comes in from Nelson and City’s marking is non-existent. John Stones will know he should have been tight to Rodrigo Muniz as Fulham’s striker is on his own with time to control the ball and finish. City weathered that late storm to keep their 3-2 lead, but they have also conceded goals from crosses to Arsenal, Wolves and Bournemouth. City have had disruption in their defence, with Guardiola fielding six different back fours in 11 Premier League games. That said, equally concerning for Guardiola is how City have conceded in flurries in their last couple of defeats — two goals in five minutes to Brighton and three in 11 to Sporting Lisbon — which perhaps suggests a lack of leadership and character.      Guardiola’s side may face on onslaught of crosses from Spurs, who lead the league in this stat When you concede, you need to come together as a group, not allow your opponents to gain confidence and energy from grabbing that first goal. It would be ridiculous for anyone to write off City. They’re still in all the fights which they have won before, for the Premier League, for the Champions League and so on. This is fixable, of course it is. Guardiola is the professor of football in today’s game. His back is against the wall as he feels others are celebrating their four-defeat slump. But you can bet he will come out swinging like the serial winner he is. Your email address will not be published.

City are locked in a battle with the top flight after they were charged with 115 breaches of financial rules, with a verdict expected in the new year. Relegation is one potential punishment should City be found guilty of serious offending. And Guardiola admitted rivals’ presumption of City’s guilt had played a part in his decision this week to extend his contract. ‘I read something about how we need to be relegated immediately,’ he said. ’75 per cent of the clubs want it, because I know what they do behind the scenes and this sort of stuff.   ‘I prefer not to be in that position but once it’s there I love it — because you believe in your club and the people there. I believe what they say to me (about the alleged breaches) and the reasons why. We’re awaiting the sentence in February or March. ‘What happens if we are relegated? I will be here. I don’t know the position they are going to bring us. The Conference? ‘But we will come up and come up and come back to the Premier League. I feel it.’      Pep Guardiola has insisted that 75 per cent of Premier League clubs want Manchester City ‘to be relegated immediately’      City are locked in a battle with the top flight after they were charged with 115 breaches of financial rules      Clubs approved changes to sponsorship rules despite City’s attempts to have them thrown out Guardiola spoke out after a Premier League summit in London, where the clubs approved changes to sponsorship rules despite City’s attempts to have them thrown out. City had argued the framework around associated party transactions — deals clubs make with companies linked to their owners — was null and void after a legal challenge they triggered deemed sections of the regulations unlawful. However, 16 of the 20 clubs voted in favour of the Premier League’s amendments. City had threatened legal action should the changes be voted through, and that remains their position. They will now await guidance from a tribunal in January. Should it find in their favour, the new rules may be ripped up. City had accused the Premier League of rushing through the rule changes and chief executive Richard Masters of misleading clubs when he said the proposed amendments could be made swiftly. They had called for a delay until the panel who deemed parts of the rules unlawful returned with a verdict on whether that meant changes — such as including shareholder loans in the rules — could be made or whether the whole system needed re-writing. Aston Villa publicly backed City, but only Saudi-owned Newcastle United and Nottingham Forest joined them yesterday, leaving the champions three short of the figure needed to block the plans. Manchester United and, perhaps surprisingly, Chelsea spoke in favour of the amendments. A Premier League statement said: ‘At a Premier League shareholders’ meeting today, clubs approved changes to the League’s associated party transaction (APT) rules. ‘The amendments to the rules address the findings of an arbitration tribunal following a legal challenge by Manchester City to the APT system earlier this year. The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at fair market value by virtue of relationships with associated parties. ‘These rules were introduced to provide a robust mechanism to safeguard the financial stability, integrity and competitive balance of the league.’ Meanwhile, clubs unanimously voted for the Premier League to establish an in-house media operations business. From 2026-27, all international media content production and distribution will be brought in-house, ending a 20-year partnership with IMG. Your email address will not be published.
